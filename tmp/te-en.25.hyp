Man Ki Bath - My favorite patriot, Namaskar
On 26 January the festival of the Republic celebrated all over the country with great enthusiasm .
It's like the celebration of our nation's culture in a way that India is the authority of the nation, the authority of the people of the country, our integrity of democracy.
It communicates the pre-democracy toward Talu's responsibilities.
But how deep the responsibility of the people in our country, how deep it is to discuss, not so much.
At every level, always, I hope to give power as power as well as power.
The authority can move forward fast on our two patterns of authority.
On 30 January, our pilgrimage is the pilgrimage.
On 30 January morning, at 11:30 in the morning, both sat for minute, we pay tribute to the survivors who were killed for the country.
Socially, it must be naturally transformed in the country.
Two minutes also show respect for equality, vision, martyrs.
In our country, the army, the security forces will show a natural admonition.
I appreciate all his family members who are honored with various awards in the morning of this Republic Day.
In these awards there are many types like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Dutt, Vishisht Seva Dutt etc.
I have been particularly telling young people that you are very excited in the social media.
Can you work
This time, whoever enjoys heroic works - you search in a long way, get four good things related to them, send them to all your friends.
When they understand the bravery, the brave transition, we get surprising inspiration from gurva besides surprise.
On 26 January, while we were on one side of the horrific, excited, our soldiers in Kashmir were engaged in the protection of the country.
We've got valor all week after the ice clutches broke.
This hero is praying to all the jewels in a graceful manner.
My young ladies, you all know well, I'm constantly speaking in mind.
Every month of January, February, March, April, every family is waiting.
If there are tests for each of the children in the house, all of them in the house will be charged.
I had this right time to talk to students and their teachers and their teachers.
Because I'm gonna go to the corners, whoever joins, these tests have been found to be a big problem.
Families, students, teachers all are seen gathering.
A big strange mental environment is seen in every house.
I always think everyone's coming out of it.
That's why I'm gonna talk to young ladies.
When I declare this, many teachers, guardians, students sent me messages, questions, advice.
Appearance, please.
Looking at them, I want to share the thought that came in my mind.
I got the Telephone message from the creation.
Listen, what the creation is, "Sir, I want to tell you what, at our home, in the worst houses, there will be a terrible atmosphere in our society.
Because of this, students are unsuccessful than inspiration.
So, I've heard that such a weather was not enjoyable. "This question was created, but this question remains in all your minds.
The observation must be during pleasure.
Now there's a chance to say that the whole surrounding has been difficult, it's a matter of hope, excitement.
The tests are enjoying something.
It's a pressure for many.
It's only on the decision you change it to stress, or make it enjoyable.
Enjoying people benefit.
Those who are stressed are suffering.
That's why I mean it's like a fair for the observers.
Believe tests as festivals.
Festival comes out when the festival is celebrated.
Our social power also appears during the festival.
What's exactly the same appearance.
Ordinarily we think we're so synonymous.
But seeing the arrangements made in the Kumbh fairs that take place with forty-ninety five days, how can the regularity come as required, how many synonyms are in the people.
It's festive.
Even in the tests, all the friends in the middle of the family, have an excitement between them.
You see that pressure will become enjoyed.
Festival drives the testimony.
That's why I'm telling all parents, you change all these three-four months as an exciting environment.
The whole of the house is a team to facilitate a festival and encouraging your own role.
It's gonna change as soon as you see.
The fact is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir , from Kach to Kamrup , from Amrailli to Arunachal Pradesh these three four months are tested .
It's our responsibility.
It's our responsibility to bring about changes in this festival according to our family conditions, through our methods, every three-four months of debris.
That's why I'm called "Smile More, Score More" with all of you.
The more you enjoy the time, the more changes you can earn.
Watch out.
You're gonna see, you're enjoying as much as you're laughing, you're gonna be so funny.
How naturally you get rest, the more things that happened will come to you.
I remember what teachers say in the classroom before the sequence.
Another thing you want to know is that Relax is another important method of reminding.
All the doors will be closed if you are stressed.
The outside thing doesn't go inside, the inner communication doesn't come out.
Thinking is slow.
It becomes a burden.
You're gonna see, you'll remember all in the tests.
Book, reading, reminding the term numbers.
There's something coming down in the letter, but don't remember the word to be written.
After the hall came out of the test, "Hey.
Remember when this word is Kada.
I didn't remember the tests by pressing.
How did you remember coming out
You guys
Nobody even said.
Remembered again
It's inside why the wire came to remember that Myra came out of the turmoil.
That's why it's relax if something's the great medicine to promote memory.
I'm telling you through my own experience, if you're suppressed, we'll forget ourselves.
But when relaxed, how many things that work don't imagine will come to us.
You don't know or not.
No information or not, no industry or not.
When you're stressed, your knowledge, things you know will get stuck under that pressure.
So the 'A happy mind' is the symbol of a good mark-sheet' అన్నది.
Sometimes we don't see the test at the right point of view.
Something looks like a lifestyle problem.
Testing you're writing, you're studying all year long.
It's not life test.
How you live, how you live, how you want to live, not to test me.
There are many more tests in your life without the tests given by the node book in the classroom.
So, the observers get out of the imagination of the windows of life.
Our former president.
P.
J.
The great example of Abdol Kalan's is before our eyes.
He had to reach the Air Force.
Finished.
What if he lost his life because of that failure, would India have received such a big scientist
Have you got such a great president
Not found.
Anybody, Racha Anand, sent me a question- "This time, the most important tasks to see today in the field of education, the study has become centered.
Marculle became the most important one.
That's why the opponents are growing.
The stress of the students has also grown well.
That's why the present direction of the university wants to know your thought by being subject to its future.
"Their question is answer.
But Racha Garu also wanted to know my opinion.
Marks, there's a limited use to the marks list.
It's not the same survival in life.
Your life depends on everything you don't have any knowledge.
You're gonna live your life on what you used to gain your life.
In life - you're gonna have to do, you're gonna have to do it in life if you're helping each other or you're supposed to be careful about food, you'll be with Markul's problem.
Then you don't have to run back to the Marks.
Your knowledge, skill, self-confidence, will work in life.
Tell me, a family doctor would have been yours to show you the whole family.
You're never asking him how many changes he passed from that family doctor.
No one's asking.
Good doctor for him.
He's giving you his services that you're benefiting from him.
Do you see a shot on his mark when you're gonna go to some big wicks after a big case
You see his experience, knowledge, how much he loves.
That's why the burden of these numbers don't let us go sometimes on the right path.
But I don't think that doesn't mean to stop reading anything else.
It's definitely necessary for your tests.
I'm still here, I need tests to know the base of Irozekda.
Sometimes when you're watching your life, running for the Marks, you're gonna find the barriers.
See only what you need.
Let's focus on them.
But when there are other questions other than you want, you'll be surprised at once when there are other questions without you learned questions.
Besides, if you concentrate on knowledge, you try to understand many things.
Besides, if you look at the marks, you'll make a circumstance for the Markuls and gradually screw up in it.
So, what's going on, there's a chance of sometimes disappearing in life.
Rucha Garu also used the word 'Pratispartha '.
It's a big psychological war.
To tell the truth, life doesn't work to move forward.
It's useful to run life ahead.
Support means competition with you.
How's the time to come better than the past
What to do if there's a chance to come out of the consequences
You're often watching the game.
I'm giving you examples of the world of sports that you understand.
Many of them have the specialty of the life of the fair sportsmen that they compete with themselves .
Let's take the example of Sachin Tandulkar's.
It's a miraculous journey to go ahead by defeating yourself every year, accompanying twenty years of your record.
Because, he enjoyed the path better than the opponent.
Friends, every field of life, even when you go to test, can you cross the time to study peacefully two hours before three hours
They weren't able to get up at the time they decided before.
Are you getting up for a fixed time now
You don't have to sleep before the test, don't you
Take that check on you.
You're gonna swear.
All the opponents of competition, the embarrassment, the jealousy.
But Self-potty creates all self-consciousness, self-consciousness.
It strengthens the vitality.
When you've defeated you, you're gonna get yourself to go further.
There's no other power requirement.
Generates that power within the same within.
If you say smoothly, you're gonna have three important things if you're competitive.
That's the first one you're shining than the others.
Two, you're very fewer than the others or they're equal to them.
If you're shining, you're very self-confidence.
If you are less than the others then you will be filled with despair, grief and grief.
That luck will eat you in.
You don't think you need to stimulate equal competitions.
They run the same way as the train runs.
So I'm gonna tell you that, sweetheart today.
What have I done so far
How do you do that
How'd you do well
Look at that.
You seem to have a lot of change.
S.
Sundarji explains his views about the guardians.
He thinks the role of protectors in the tests is so important.
What did he say - "My mother didn't die much.
But sit at me and ask me to take a look.
I'm gonna help me fix my answers.
Threatened.
My mother didn't finish the fifteenth grade, but without sweeping, C.
B.
S.
These tests aren't scared.
"Good, you're real.
You're still seeing.
There are more women in the advisors who questioned me.
Because, in the future of children in the house, they can make many things easier with natural interest, activity, etc.
Look at the three things I say to the guardians.
Accepting, teaching, giving time.
Please accept that.
Use it as much as you have.
If you're in work, spare time.
Once you learn to accept, the main problems will be over there.
Protectors, teachers believe in the roots of the problem.
It's experienced to every guardian.
The solutions of the problem of Taluko are open only through switching.
The audience makes the star difficult.
Accepting the situation opens new paths.
So, accept it.
You'll also be weird.
We're talking about the weight of children's schoolbag.
But I think, sometimes the patrons' aspirations, hopes, children's schools go away from the bags.
Well, what's the last thing - We've been in the hospital with a well-known heart attack.
Then the first Speaker Ganesh Dada Mawlanger of our Lok Sabha of India, his son, at once.
P. Purushottam came to see Mavalankar at the hospital.
I'm in there now.
There was no question about the health of the patient who came.
As soon as he came, the situation there was a disease, but the patient didn't talk about the health, but he started laughing.
In two minutes the whole atmosphere was lightened.
As a matter of fact, when we meet a person with sickness, we'll scare them with the name of disease.
I'm talking to the guardians, sometimes we'll pretend like this to the kids.
Have you ever thought that the child was laughing at the test day
Look at that, the atmosphere changes.
I got a painting phone call.
He didn't tell his name.
You'll understand why he can't say the name.
"Namaskara Pradhan Mantri Garu.
I didn't say my name.
That's what I did in my childhood.
Sometimes I tried to see once.
So I started making a lot of efforts.
Trying to find its methods.
That's why my time was too old.
As long as I tried to see the time when I put a brake, how long I'd elapsed that time when I used to study well, he would have earned the marks.
Besides trying to see, I was also facing very trouble for friends around me, not being caught.
"You're right.
These obstacles are the reasons for seeing them.
Sometimes because we don't believe in us, I think I'm coming to fix it right, Kada.
Once we wrote correctly, the bastard keeps on losing it because he's wrong.
That's why it's never useful to see.
'To chaat is to be chap, so please, do not cheat' I'll see you evil.
Don't see that.
Don't you ever see it, you'll hear it.
I'll tell you the same thing again.
You see how it sees you swimming you on the way to fail life.
If you're caught in the test, your life will be destroyed.
If you don't get caught, I don't have the impossible effect of doing this to my life.
When your kids had to tell you you can't talk to see their eyes smoothly.
Once the habit of watching is fallen, there will never be a penny to learn anything in life.
How long can you go then
If you're throwing your roads into the gate, I've seen how many talents you use to find new methods to see, how much money you invest, spend for your entire creativity.
The same creativity, the same time, on test matters, is not really necessary to see.
What is the result of your own difficulty, the growing self-confidence will be marvellous.
A phone call came: "Namaskara Pradhan Mantri
Don't beat my name.
I'm twelve-year-old student.
I've asked you two questions so I'm talking about board exams for the 12th grade student.
What's my first question, what reduces the increasing pressure during the test
The second question is, all the tests are also concerned, but why aren't there about the games
Thank you. When I talk to you about the games during the test, I'd suppose the kids.
What's the prime minister
That's your teachers, your parents will hunt me.
Because the students generally think that the attention of the sports is reduced by studying .
Aasley is wrong to think.
It's not the real problem.
There's also a huge life outside the books to grow fully.
It's the same time to live, learn it.
I'll stop after all the tests arrive, it does, that's not what happens.
It's time to finish life.
He's called a penny.
In fact, three things are very important in my vision.
One - the right rest, the second - the need to sleep for the body, the third is also the main thing for the body except for the brain.
The rest of the body is also needed to be excited.
When did you think
When we're so in front of us, seeing the sky out, looking at the trees, looking at the trees, softening your mind, you see how excited when you come back to your room in front of books
Take a break out what you're doing.
Get in like a lift.
Eat your fucking thing, find the biscuit mouth.
Make a collision of the bust.
Break at least five minutes.
You know that your work is comfortable.
I don't know whether everyone likes it, but it's my experience.
In such a situation it is very useful to take a deep breath .
There's no room to sweat deeply.
Take the fucking sky, go to Daba and sit down to read five minutes deep breathing.
The rest you've got once all over the body will end the brain as much as possible.
Some seem to be studying more if you wake up all night but give your body as much sleep as required .
That's not the oldest time you read.
It increases the power of reading in you.
Your concentration will grow.
You'll grow freshness.
All your ability will grow well.
When I attended the election meeting, sometimes my throat smells.
Once a folk guy came to meet me.
He asked me to fall for hours.
I asked you to be a doctor.
No, not.
I said it was related to your throat when you attended the election meeting.
I said you'd get a lot of rest as soon as you sleep well.
I don't ever think of my throat ringing, my respiration, my throat.
He gave me a great vegetation.
We really have to recognize the importance of these.
They will benefit.
But never slept doesn't understand.
Some might say the prime minister of sleeping is not smooth.
Don't do that.
Otherwise your family members can hurt me.
If you don't see them on your marks list, it'll have to be seen today.
Don't do that.
That's why I'm calling - "P for prepared and P for play", those who play, "The person who plays, shines" is a great medicine to make sense, intelligence, body aware.
Okay, young ladies, you're trying to test, I'm putting you in "the words".
I think my only words are sure to rest you.
That's all but don't wear the word I said.
Do it if possible.
Don't let it happen.
Otherwise they're bored.
So, your family's parents don't want you to be brave as you say, that's acting to me too.
Reminding your vision, go to the tests keeping your trust.
My pursuits to you.
Remove every test to sneeze every test.
It's never like testing.
Please move forward with this mission.
Loving countrymen, February 1, 2017 completes the Indian Coast Guard 40 years.
During this time, the Coast Guard's officers, all the soldiers are telling Ganu Thanks for their service.
A total of 126 boats built in the country, 62 planes have placed their place in the world's four largest coastal security forces.
It's so proud.
That's the supremacy of the supremacy.
In order to preserve the sea shores of the country, the shores of the shores of the sea shores, the shores of the survivors are also prepared for the night in the events of everybody.
With their responsibilities, our country carried out the program to clean the seashore.
Thousands of people involved in it.
They also thought about the cleanliness of the shore of Pattu with boundlessness.
It's really a matter of appreciation.
Besides men, women are also responsible for them in the Coast Guard.
A lot of people in our country know that successfully run.
In the Coast Guard, the Women's Officer's Pilot is also functioning on the Hovercraft Command not only as a supervisor.
Under the protection of Indian shores, our security of sea shores has also become a major part of the world.
Therefore, for the completion of 40 years of the Indian Territory of India, they have many purifications.
Pribrary is the one-two Tarikhna వసంత Panchmi festival.
Business season was accepted by everyone in the best season.
The king of spring season.
On the day of Basti Panchayat in our country Saraswati is celebrated as a festival .
I think it's a chance for education.
Besides, this day they inspire.
The same inspiration to "Mera Rang De Basanti Chola".
My countrymen have many pursuits during this celebrated spring festival.
My favorite country's people, the skyman is always filling new colors with his motive.
Since last month, they started listening to my words finished in territorial languages.
It's got a wide sight.
People from far away are coming to the north.
With the inspiration of the sky, I appreciate them how much this work they did.
People of the country, I appreciate you too.
To unite with you, the word in mind gives me a great chance.
Everyone's ever sacred.
Thank you.
