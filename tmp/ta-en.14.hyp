Folks, sweethearts, supdember 2017, the voice of the mind.
This is the voice of the last heart of this year, today is also one of the last days of this year.
We've come across many things throughout the year.
I've come to give you a new power to your magnificent letters, ideas, ideas, etc. for the cheek of the mind.
And a few hours later, we'll change the year, but we'll always be running as usual.
In the coming years, we'll talk about new things, we'll have new experiences.
You all live long enough for the 2018.
A few days ago on the 25th day of December the people of the world celebrate Christmas festival as a galaxy .
This festival was celebrated with the enthusiasm of people in India as well .
During Christmas we will remind of the great instruments of Aishunath .
If he put pressure on a lot of thing, it's a service tension.
We can also see the version of service tension.
The Son of Man has come, not to be served, but to serve, and give his life, as blessing to all humankand.
It doesn't mean to accept the service, to serve, to give mankind their lives to all, to humiliate the human child on Earth.
It shows us what service is the significance of tension.
The service is a valuable symbol of human fashion, whether it is any species of the world, whether it is religious or genuine, but it is colored.
In our country, we're talking about the "disputed action", that there is no neglect of reflection in such activity.
"Seva Paramo Dharam" means the service itself is called your skinny.
Jew Seva He Shiv Seva means people's service is also called as the Macassion Service, right
Guru God Ramkrishna Paramahamsar says that the service of the life of the Shiva should be done only by the throat that from this the whole world is the same as human beings .
Come, let's take the memories of the glory in mind, darkness within the sacred days, give us a new awareness of these great fountain traditions, give new energy, we try to live like this life.
My folks, this year Kurukovind Singh was born 350th year.
The unusual life of Gurukovind Singh, his comfort and compassionate life, enjoys us enjoying ourselves.
Gurukovind Singh gave him the advice regarding the most important lifestyle, on the basis of those fountains, he showed his entire life alive.
A guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, a gurukovind Singh who worked to enjoy the people through all these parts.
He touched the war against immunity and pride.
In this struggle, he had to lose many things in personal life.
People gave education to the royal and religious rituals.
But he hasn't been in his mind for any time inconscience.
Every moment of life gave me the message of love, sacrifice, peace.
Have you seen the kind of personality with great specialties
In the beginning of this destination Gurukovind Singh , who was present in Patna Shahib , had come to me to participate in his 300th birthday .
Come, we're gonna learn from Gurukovind Singh's great advice, his predictionary life, to improve our lives.
On the 1st day of January, 2018, that's the most important day for me, day.
Buddhists come and come every year on the 1st day of January, but it's really important when it's a special day.
Whoever was born in 2000 or after that, that he was born in the 21st century, he would begin to become the valuators who eligible for the year 2018.
In the public vision of India, I will welcome the vocalists of the 21st century, the new India vocalists.
We're deciding these young men of my life, and I'd like to leave all of you, that's why you all go and book yourselves as vocalists.
All over India, in the form of 21st century vocalists, it gets stuck for you.
Like the words of the 21st century, you also experience the grave, huh
Your promise is going to be the base of New India.
Walk's power, the greatest power of democracy.
The instrument that makes a significant change in millions of lives, is the biggest impact.
You won't be the only authority to claim.
How should your India be in the 21st century
What are your dreams about the 21st century India
You can also be the 21st century institute of India , its start is specially on the 1st day of the month of January .
Today, I'd like to talk about a small society that we produced from 18 to 25 years of age in the church of my heart.
I think they're young in New India YOUTH, that's New India.
New India's youth, young, enthusiasm, energy.
I believe our dream of new India is thrilled by the ability of our powerful youngsters, even the experts.
When we talk about new India, we must be left out of the new India royalty, religious, provocative, tragic.
It must be dirty and depressed.
In the new India, everybody needs equal opportunities, everyone's wishes and competitors must be fulfilled.
In the new India, peace, peace, goodness must be our only guidance powers.
My new Indian youths, come forward, investigate how new India can be built.
In the same way, whoever is connected, whoever displays a new way to stay, and connect them to the field.
You also advance, advance the country.
Now, if I'm talking to you, there's an idea in my mind, why shouldn't we arrange a kind of court in every district of India
There are 25 young men from the age of 18, sitting together, studying the ideas of new India, finding ways, planning
How can we finish our decisions before 2022
Do you think that our freedom fighters are dreaming to build India
Gandhians, converted the freedom struggle into people's desert.
My young friends, we must also make a fate of a people in the 21st century of great India.
It's the people's desert for progress.
Developing people.
The people of India with vitality and power.
On the 15th day of August, in Delhi, organized a specific court, where the youth selected from every district, could have been formed in the next five years as a new India.
How do you get to win through psychology
Today, there have been new opportunities before the youth.
Our youths come forward and come to the new generations and industrialization, and come to the conclusion of success.
My intention is to get information about the plans that make all these opportunities, to the young people of New India.
With 18 years of age, young people have to make a form of information about all these things in a natural way, and they need a lot of benefits.
My folks, I've spoken about the importance of psychological, creative thinking in the past.
The concert sloka comes to my memories... the meaning of this is that a man full of excitement is very powerful because there is no other thing than excitement, Positivity and enthusiasm can roast anything.
There's also a case in English - Pessimism Leads to Weakness, Optimism to Power.
I mean, it's not possible to weaken the sympathy that can enhance the energy.
My last heart was asking us to commemorate the architecture of the 2018 AD.
I am enjoying that most of the people have made answers to the social levels, the Macau correspondence, the Narender Mody Activity.
Positive India Hashtag has also made millions of duties, which has just reached more than 150 crores.
In a way this extension of miracle has spread throughout the world beginning in India.
Reports and answers are really predictable.
It was a pleasant experience for me.
Some of the folks have defined some of the events that took place this year, which have caused a significant impact on their minds.
Some are surpassing their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Botia.
I'm staying in Delhi's Myurvihar's packet on, Face Ohnn.
My daughter, M.
B.
Hey.
Wanted to read.
For this, I needed a treasure, it's got to be very comfortable, and I could compete with my daughter too.
My name is Jodi Rajendra Wadde.
I'm staying in the box.
GONDER WAS THE WASTING THAT A SHOUGHING A SHOUTING A SHOUTING.
He had to die in a terrible accident.
Then we only know about the bad situation that happened to us.
We've got a lot of benefits due to the government's help, so that we could pursue it.
My name is Santosh Jatav.
Our (BHINNAR) National Highway was set up in the year 2017 on the way to the background.
Because of this our roads have become very special, our business has begun to grow.
My name is Dipansu Ahuja, located in the Saddhanganj area of Shaharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
The two events that were published by our army were very impressioned in my mind - one of the surgical strikes they did in Pakistan, so that the launching pads of the militants could be marked, and the second, our monsters in Douglam, were unexpected.
My name is Satish (BEVANI) Bawani.
In our area, when the drunken drains were flooded, for the last 40 years, we came to believe in the military drainage pipe.
Now there's only a drunken cell for us alone...
.
This is our biggest achievement of the year 2017.
Due to many activity of strengthening the conditions, there has been a significant change in the lives of the adventures.
Actually, this is the new India, this is what we're building together.
Come on, with these little pleasures, we'll start in Pothand, from Positiveland to Progressive India.
If we talk about the creative ideas that makes us feel like I have to share a thing.
In the examinations of the Kashmir State Registrar I had asked about the story of the fervor of Ajjeyu Bashir Khan who was selected in a very romantic manner .
He was expelled from the bonds of grave, embroidery, and was very fond of the rule of the Kashmir state.
You're glad to know that the architects burnt his house in 1990.
In the case of acuteness and adversity, his family was forced to get out of the soil.
In a small boy's life, it's enough for him to communicate on the sides of the snake, to compete with the heart and torture.
But Anges didn't know them, but they couldn't influence their mind.
He didn't let me believe that too.
He devised a way for you - that's a way to serve the people.
He's supposed to be a terrible environment, and he denied his victory.
Today, he is not only for the Jammu Kashmir but also a glorious person.
Even though the environment is so bad, by creative actions, it's impressionable to finish the degrading clouds.
Last week some women of Jammu and Kashmir had the chance to meet .
They're jealous, excitement, dreams...
.
I'm asking you what they're looking forward to in your life.
How many negative people were they
If I was talking to them, I didn't read the meaning of depression - excitement, nervousness, power, dreams, temperament.
I spent the expenses with those ladies, enjoyed me, that's the strength of the country, they're my little tricks, they're the future of my country.
My favorite folks, not only in our country, ever speak about the famous pilgrimages of the world, but also speaking about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala, isn't it a natural thing
Crores of devotees come every year to this world famous temple to receive the gratitude of mystery.
In such a number of devotees, how big will it be to say sacredness in this pilgrimage filled with so much importance
You can imagine how difficult it is to keep its place clean between mountains and forests .
But how to transform the sanitation into culture, to find a way to harm the problem, the Sabar Hill temple is an example of how people change the participant into power.
B.
Vijayan's officer started an activity called the Garden of Representation, accordingly, he started cleaning the awareness of cleanliness.
He made such a tradition that if the visitors did not give any physical participation in the sacred work, they would not fulfil their journey.
This act is a big man, nobody's a small man.
The worship of every traveller, sympathizer, disposed of time in purifying, assisted, engaged in the service of removing the mosquitoes.
Everyday the pure view of the legs here is very unique, all the pilgrims join themselves in it.
Whatever a man is very valuable, however big admirers, however big officer, everybody participates in the parking program as a simple traveler.
There are many such examples for our folks.
This ritual of the park has become a part of the journey of every traveller , which has been developed in such a way in Sabar Hill .
There, along with hard humiliation, also communicates the sure decision regarding sanitation.
My poor folks, on the date of October 2, 2014, made a decision on the birthday of Gandhian.
The sufficient work of the skin is a pure India, abandoned from the masses.
He tried to do this work for the whole life of his life.
On the 150th birthday of her, we decided to share her in that direction that she dreamed of India, pure India.
In the direction of cleanliness, efforts are being made to spread the whole of the country.
In rural areas and urban areas , changes are seen with the help of people and people .
As per the level of cleanliness in the urban areas, the world has been undertaken by the name of "2018, "Please Studies 2018", from January 4 to March 10, 2018.
Only 40 crores of people are settled in more than 4,000 cities.
Relieving from expulsion of toilets in cities, surveillance of snakes, transportation of gutters, scientific snakes, attempts to make changes, capacity buildings, purifying new portions in this study will be counted.
According to this research, other groups will go to cities and conduct research.
Citizens will get answers from them.
The use of pure work and the management of various types of service centres is done .
It is also believed that all the structures of the city have been created in the form of the nature of the people who are cleaning the city.
It's not the government's only to act as sacred.
Every dweller, citizen organisation, has a great deal in it.
In the days to come, there is a study of sanitation, in which I'm going to keep every dweller in front of you.
You don't have to go back to your city, you don't want to go back to your street or part.
I'm sure the blue skull for the filthy skull in the house, and the blue skull for the Macaque hut, you're now finished.
Reduce - reduction , reuse - repetition and recycl - resistance principles are very beneficial .
On the basis of this research, if the population of your city is more than one lakh, the country-wide level, if the population is less than one lakh, the area will be leveled.
You have to be dreamed of finding your city's very supreme standard, and your efforts should be made to do this.
In the purificial research conducted on 4th January to 10th March 2018, you should be a common thing that you should not go back to this healthy campaign related to cleanliness.
Try our city, ours
You must be the dream of our progress, the progress of the country.
Come on, with this decision, we will once again be able to reconcile the mind of God, make a pure faith, work with regret.
My folk folks, some things may be small to see, but socially, our marks are affected by remote places.
Today, in the hoove of the mind, I'd like to share a thing with you through this program.
Any Muslim woman, who wants to travel Haj, brought me into consideration that she can't go without a male cop.
When I first asked about this, how can this be
Who's making such a law
Why was it all the evil effect.
When I saw this deeply thinking, I was glad-- those who controlled it even after 70 years of independence
For many years, the Muslim women have been embarrassed, but there was no debate about this.
Such laws are not even in many Muslim countries.
But the Muslim women of India have renovated this right.
I'm glad our government paid attention to it.
Our youngsters have taken necessary actions, and have come to the conclusion of the tradition that lasted for 70 years, this control has been removed.
Today, the Muslim women, the male cops , can not even go to Haj tour, this time 1300 Muslim women have been pursuing Haj tour without men's cops.
From Kerala to north India, women from different parts of the country have expressed interest in traveling Haj.
In such a situation, all the women who have been asked to travel separately have been instructed to give permission to visit Haj yatra.
Ordinarily the travellers going to Haj will be selected in a club style.
But the women who want to go alone should be kept away from this clutches, they're guessed that they should be black and sweet.
The development journey of India, the strength of our women, their intellectual progress, and I'm fully aware of the progress, it's my stress.
We must try to steal the rightful rights, chances and women.
They also show the progress of men together on the development path.
My folks, the 26th of January, we all have an important historical day.
But the future will be specially remembered on the 26th of January, 2018.
This year the leaders of the ten countries of Asia formed in the trinity of the princely state have come to India as major residents .
On the third day of the state, this time none of the ten major residents are involved.
The history of India has not been so far.
In the year 2017, Asia is also important for the constitution of India.
The establishment of Asia has completed its 50 years , in the year 2017 itself it has taken 25 years to the comprehensive India of Asian constitution .
On the 26th day of January , these great leaders of 10 countries of the world , together , have gathered here , one of the most important things of ours .
Lovely folks, it's the season of money.
To see our country is the country of money.
It's very unprecedented that there'll be no plans for a day.
Now everyone has celebrated Christmas festival, next year, Buddha is born.
Absolutely joys, smokes, fulfilments for everyone in the coming Buddhist year.
The new temper, new excitement, new emotion, advance with a new decision, will progress the nation.
In the month of January, the Uttarayan period of Sun will be celebrated in this month only.
It's the time associated with nature.
If you say, we are connected to nature in every stage, but in our unprecedented culture, this magnificent presentation of nature is the habit of celebrating in different varieties.
If the enjoyment of Lohari increases in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh , then in Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Kichhati and Til Shankranti are expected .
In Rajasthan , Sangrand is known as Mag-Pihu in Assam , which is famous for all the specialities of gold .
All these festivals are celebrated between the 13th and 17th of the month of January .
Namedically, even if they are different, the principles of their idols are the only one - the relationship between nature and agriculture.
The folks enjoy these festivals in front of everyone.
Once again, you're all weakened for 2018 Buddhist years.
Thank you, folks.
We're meeting again in 2018.
Thank you.
.
