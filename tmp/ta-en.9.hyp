The voice of the mind, May 2018.
There's a chance to meet all of you once again through the voice of the mind.
I think a team of six female commanders of the Indian treasure has been sea-marketing for months and remembers all of you.
I'd like to talk about some things about this team called Navika Sagar Parikrama.
This team with six women of India has been more than 250 days.
My.

Travelling in the sea, pursuing the world, returning to the country on the 21st day of Emperor, and coming out of the country.
They have crossed a distance of only 22,000 seas by traveling in various coastal areas, many seas.
Such a journey has been done for the first time in the world .
On the last morning, these female gems met, they found a chance to hear about their experiences.
I once again demonstrate my admiration to them, especially the women of India who do not cheer in the world, the special activity of those who have been published, the prophecy of the trumpets, the importance of the country, etc.
You don't know who's a simple feeling.
If we see the development journey of human society, progress has been born from the center of some harmony.
The growth is the child born in the pregnancy.
Something should be slaughtered, the idea of slavery, the purpose of doing something extraordinary, can be slaughtered, but for many ages, many people have been enjoying this.
We're asking for many new things about the climbers on the Everest.
For centuries, Everest peak has been living in a sword for human society, humiliated people have been fighting for this safari.
On the 16th of May , a group of five tribal students comprising an ashramap school in Chandrapur of Maharashtra , Manish Turve, Pramesh Ale, Umanant Madvi, Kavitas Kathmode, Vikas Soyam etc . have gathered on the highest peak of the world .
These students of Ashram School started their training in the month of August of 2017 .
They trained at Warda, Patna, Darjeeling, Le, Ladakh.
According to the training program of Shaurya, these youngsters were selected.
According to the name, in the Everest Square, they established the country's honour.
Chandrapur's school dwellers, and my young friends, are deliberately appreciating their hearts.
Accordingly, the 16-year-old woman of India, Shiwangi Pathak, is the youngest Indian woman in Nepal, who has been the highest age of Everest peak.
A lot of appreciation for Shivangi.
Azith Bajaj will join his daughter-in-law, the first father-in-law of the Everest Corps of India.
Nothing young is climbing on the Everest peak.
On the day of May 19th day more than 50 years of Sankeeta Behal had climbed the Everest peak .
Some of the climbers on the Everest peak show that you have power, feeling.
In the past, according to the Swachh Ganga Abhian, the pure Ganga drive, a team of border guards climbed on the Everest Square, but when they came down, they brought the skulls to hand.
It's a matter of appreciation that, in the same way, the sacred material of environment shows the surroundings of the surroundings.
For many years people have climbed the Everest peak, many of them have also succeeded.
I'm supposed to appreciate my heart's praise for all the fighters, especially women.
My heartfelt folks, especially my little community friends
Two months ago, when I spoke about Fit India, I couldn't see that there would be such answers to him.
I don't think all the sections of the people would see the support of it.
If I speak about Fit India, I imagine the amount of sports we're engaged in, the country's also involved in the game.
In social publicity fitness chellenges i . e . sex related symptoms are involved , somebody quit by making a deck.
Everyone is coming together today with this operation called Fit India.
They're film departments, sports departments, citizens, citizens of the country, military soldiers, school teachers, if we are sex, India will be sure anywhere.
Captain Virat Kohli, the Indian cricket team, pleases me to relieve me, and I accept his voice.
I believe that with helping us to keep ourselves fit like this, I inspire others to sex.
I love folks
You're asking for some of the sports of the sportsmen in the cheeks of the mind, somewhere I'm coming back, last time the Commonwealth Maidens, our men of your mind, explained our voices to us through this program, sir, I'm speaking a slave from Tuxida, I'm a lover who misunderstands your mind's voice program.
Today I'd like to show you my mind's hole.
Now summer holidays have begun, in a mother's name, I'm coming to see that children spend more time in combination games.
In our young age we played traditional games usually in open space.
For example, 7 stones - putting seven stones one foot in it, throwing it down.
Like this, there was a game of co-co.
Nobody plays such games all the time.
Please, thank you for telling the guys today about traditional sports, through which they're interested in them.
Thank you for your phone call, Savi who they are.
It is true that the games played in streets were part of every child 's life, which are coming closer today .
Especially these games have become an important part of summer holidays .
Girls will be playing for hours without any worry, after having food at night.
In some of these sports sports were sportsomely sportsome family.
Many games like Kittip Bul, Pambaram, Coli, Eysboy, Mr. Poles, Co-Co, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Gatch to Kamrup, these games were part of the composition of boyhood.
Yeah, they may have been known by different names in different places.
For example, this game called 7 stones is known by many names like Lahori, Pittu, Satolia, Tikori, Satotia.
There are two types of traditional games that play inside four walls, play in open space.
In the back of our country's confrontation, we can see complacentness in these games.
The same sports appears in different places, different names.
I knew about a game called Somal-Istho, where I joined the state of Gujarat.
It is played in 8 x 8 square feet with swollen or thirsty .
It was played in almost all the states.
In Karnataka it is also called Saukabara and in Madhya Pradesh .
This is also called Bageetalli in Kerala , Sampal in Maharashtra , Thai , Sangabo in Rajasthan .
Even though I don't know what I speak in every state language, it was only after playing, dumb, we could feel that we were playing it too.
Kittyp Blood, aren't there any of us who don't play Killie
In different parts of the country it is known by various names .
In Andhra it is also called Koti Pilla or Karrabhila , in Orissa it is also called Vititalu in Maharashtra .
There's a season for some sports.
It's a season to get rid of the wind.
When everyone gets out of the air, when all plays, we can display the separational properties of ourselves without lodging.
You can see that many children are healthy, but if they play, they will become very active.
Self-producing yourself, appearing to be very deep, the surviving childhood appears in them.
In the same way, traditional sports are designed in the enlargement of our visionary thoughts, mind-consciousness, awakening, enthusiasm.
Sports, not just sports, it teaches the fatness of life.
Determining the planet, how to reach the mind, how to create a team feeling, how to help each other.
In the training programmes related to business reservoirs, measuring the survival and mutual capabilities, I can always see the use of our traditional games.
Our traditional sports are helpful for the entire sports, and the age of playing such sports is not a perfect age.
Until the kids first, when everyone plays together, it's a difference of time, it's fucking disappeared.
We can also know our culture, traditions.
Many sports provide awareness about social, environment.
In some cases our sports are also observed to be popular .
That's why we can only lift the games, and we're gonna get away with our childhood.
And then we are asking for this poem :
Maybe we're the only way we're asking this ball.
That's why we shouldn't lose our traditional sports at any time, today it is very important to give inclination to all in schools, townships, small circles.
Together with the crowds, we can make the biggest collection of traditional sports.
These games can create pictures, in which the methods of sports, playing methods etc. can be shown.
Animation can create pictures, play on streets and streets, they will also see, play, develop these sports of our newly-publicized sports.
My funny folks, on the 5th of June, India has been organised for the world climate daily.
This is an important achievement for India.
This is the proof that the participants of growing India will get the gift of the world in the direction of reducing the weather change.
This time the beat plastic polution is black.
If you all want me to leave, you will understand this blacklist, understand its significance, try to reduce the negative impact of our health, to avoid using polishing, low quality plastic, plastic pollution, on the nature, on forest creatures.
Let the world environment enter the unparalleled widen-2018 of the day, so that the adventurous suggestions are given in a very comfortable manner - see , know them , take care of them in your daily life.
When the climate rises, when the rains rise, the rains don't stand, when it's cold, everyone turns into experts, the world's warmth, environmental deterioration.
But what's happening when you talk
We need to transform nature into our habits that we must understand, save the nature.
For the past few weeks, we've seen in many parts of the country crazy, strong winds, even the treasures, it's not a natural climate.
Life has also occurred from this.
It's the result of the changes of salvation in particular.
Our culture, our traditional composition, hasn't taught us to fight us naturally.
We must live naturally with music, be connected to nature.
The Gandhians came to the forefront of this thing every step of their life.
Today India is speaking about environmental justice.
India, C.
Oh.
B.
21 (COP-21), Paris co-operation, etc.
If the world is united by international solar power, it's the feeling of being the leader of the country to thrive the dreams of Gandhians.
This climate can keep our land clean and fresh every day, in such a way that we can move forward, so that we can keep our thoughts horses.
It's rainy season, and this time we're gonna take the tree to our planet.
Don't stop the trees, until it grows big, and arranges a way to rehearse it.
My poor folks, especially my young friends
Now you remember the 21st of June, not only you, but also the date of June 21st of the world.
In the whole world on the 21st of the month of June International Yoga art is celebrated , which has become one of all accepted , many months before people begin to gather in manufacturing tales .
It is a matter of fact that the programs of International Yoga festival coming on the 21st day of the month of June are going on very well in the world .
It's the message that provides for the unity of yoga, society, which has experienced the world again for the past few years.
The great poet of Sanskrit , Bharthruhari , in his words written several centuries ago , Tirya Yashya Pitha Kshama , Sunni Santishetra , Chanurya , Shaya Sabhini , Prada , Shayam , Tsobhi Vasana , Bhojna , Adeysya family : Vatha Sake Kasmad , Yoga : The meanings of this sympathy , which has been described for decades before , changes some good qualities like close relations , friends .
Yoga gets fascinated by playing, it always protects us like a father.
Contraceptive feelings, it's like being their mother in children, psychology turns us into a sweet friend.
Farthruhari says that the continuation of yoga is our children, our brother and our brother, our hearts, our bed and knowledge, our hunger.
If all these qualities are one of his opponents, the yogis warm up on all kinds of marks.
Once again I'll invite all the folks to go ahead with yoga tradition, get rid of a healthy, happy, happy country.
My Fashmik folks
Today 27th May.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, was his memorial.
I'm supposed to appreciate my request to Panditji.
This is the month of May and one of them, he's the Veer Square.
During the same month of May 1857 our natives showed their strength against the British .
In many parts of the country, our warriors and peasants, dressed against hypocrisy, showed their evil.
It's a matter of tremor that, for a long time, the 1857-year-old complications were saying, "Chipy's clan".
In fact, it wasn't merely imagined to reduce that disappearance, it's just an attempt to ignore our self-consciousness and self-sacrifice.
It happened in 1857, it wasn't just a confusion, but it was the first freedom fighter.
Several freedom fighters associated with Savarka celebrated the 50th year in India House in London.
A miraculous consequence of our first freedom fighter in the same month was born as the Veer Savardar.
The Savarkar was full of genius with them.
An expert in handling both arms and weapons.
Normally for his valor, for his struggle against British ethics, we know the Veer Savarkar.
But apart from all this, he says he has come to the immense poets, social reformists, ever good, compassionate.
Savarkar came to my memory to tell him our dearest estimation of him, Atal Bihari Wazbei.
If the sword, the sword, the sword, the sword, the sword, the principle, the sword, if the Christian thought, the sword, the sword, if the sword, the monster, the sword, the sword, the sword.
Look how nice they're describing the sermons
Savarkar, poetry, revolution, both of them.
Besides the poet of understanding, he also confronted a treacherous revolutionary act.
My nephew brothers
I was watching a program on TV.
Our poor ladies live in the houses of Seeker in Rajasthan.
Our ladies came out of the hut, travelled.
Today, they're finishing dragons, dressing clothes.
The women here today, apart from the clothes of yourselves and your family, are tied up with normal and elevated clothes.
And they're also studying competence.
Our women have become self-sufficient.
Honourfully lived your lives, they're coming to a great deal of families.
We're demonstrating ourselves for the bright future of these women's watches.
If there's a temperament to slave something, then you'll decide on your mind, you'll be able to win all the moments.
It's not just a matter of chicker, but such possibilities are found in our country's hips.
Think of your vision around, it's yours that people will be able to fight all the places.
If we go to a tea dress, we'll smoke tea there, talk to those who stay there and talk about it, huh
Speech-related political, social, film-related, sports-sports-sports-girls, the country's problems.
There's talk about the problem, the problem.
Often they stop talking.
But some people, in their actions, move forward in the direction that changes through your cross-border work and end, gives its shape.
The dreams of others are yours, the story of some who dedicate themselves to fulfill them, the residence of Orissa's dwelling in the city.
Pragash Rao is theirs.
Next time, T.
Pragash Rao got the text to meet them.
T.
Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for 50 years.
You're surprised to know that the simple man who sells tea today brings education to the life of more than 70 children.
He started a school named Asha Ashwasan for the children living in the houses.
A poor tea seller spends 50 percent of his income on this school .
All the children coming to school make all the facilities of education , health , food .
I'm T.
Prakash Rao demonstrates his immortal work, his skirmishes, the life of poor kids, his praise for giving him a new direction.
They have removed the darkness in their lives.
Who does not know the obsession of Damso Ma Jyotirkamaya
But if someone showed it, he's T.
Pragash Rav is they.
His life is a prediction for all of us, society, all over the country.
Maybe you'll be surrounding the events of such excitement.
Evaluable events can be held.
Come on, let's take us to the mind of our creative feelings
Whatever temperature rises in the month of June, the rain starts whenever it comes, this imagination has to be seen in the mind and looking for the wind.
In some more days you will also be waiting for the adventurous people.
I mean, if you say the lunar is visible, you can celebrate the festival.
In the month of Ramlan, after the festival, it has been mentioned for a long time.
I believe everyone will celebrate this festival with great enthusiasm .
In this case the children will get special gifts of good luxury .
I'm supposed to make this idea more sure of good relations in our community.
Fucking lives for everyone
My folks
Thanks for all of you.
My friends once again meet the chord next month.
Fucking
.
