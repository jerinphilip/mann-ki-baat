My favourite countrymen, Namskar, November, 2016
Last month we all celebrated Diwali.
Every year, during Deepawali, I went to China border to sacrifice with the army.
With I-T-B-P jowarns, I celebrated Deepawali celebrations in the highlands of the Himalayas.
Every year I go to the border, but this time the experience of Deepavali is completely different.
The 125 million Indians who surrendered to the Jews of the Deepavalikesena Rivers in the unparalleled emotional emotions - the fighters were now devoted to the faces of those emotional youths.
They were full of emotions and not only, the patriots who sent the goodwill, were showing a miraculous reaction to the soldiers with their happiness.
It's not just that sweethearted, someone sent poems with all emotions, someone sent a picture, a cartoon, somebody or a video.
When I was watching these things, I'm surprised to think of what he's imagined.
My-gov has decided to book a coffee table from all these marvellous sweets.
The book is going on, with the help of all of you, your emotional distinctiveness towards the soldiers of the country, to compose your thoughts with the jowars, in a book.
A Jews of the Army wrote: The Prime Minister of the United States, the Jews like us, the walls are always in the border and every moment we are worried about the security of the country.
Even then, at the time of the festival, I remember the house.
But, really, we didn't feel like this at the time of the Diwali festival.
On the contrary, it seemed that with 125 million Indians, Deepawali's celebrations were held.
Dear citizens, who are intimacy, happiness, love and joy are in our army's joys, shouldn't they be alone in Holi-Deepawali, shouldn't they
You're asking me, come, society, make it a part of nature and nature as a nation.
Any kind of festival or festival, whenever we enjoy, we will remember the joys of our army.
When the nation becomes united with the army, the strength of the army will increase by 125 million.
A few days ago, the heads of all the villages in Jammu and Kashmir met me.
Omrajammu-Kashmi had come to join the Panchayat Conference.
About 40-50 people came from different villages of Kashmir Valley.
He had a chance to talk for a long time.
Even though they came to know some claims for the development and development of the village, the recent situation of the Kashmir Valley, the law and order, the future of the children, came up.
They were talking so deeply open, and I was embarrassed.
It's a matter of burying the children's schoolball.
I saw them suffering very much like the rest of the country and they thought that the children were finished by burning the next chances of children.
I've requested the villagers to think about what they can do to protect the future of children back to their respective areas.
Today, I'm glad to say that everybody is following the suggestions of the people of the village like my request, the heads of the Kashmiri people who came to me, who spoke to me.
A few days ago, the board was busy in Kashmir and around 95 percent of the students were sitting in the examination.
In the examination of the Board, I am clearly feeling that our children in Jammu-Kashmiri are strong for the development of a bright future through education.
Not only for this participant of the students, their parents, teachers and all-round villagers are greetings.
My beloved sisters, when I've proposed a discussion about the 'Man What Wat' of this time, I admit, each one of them has proposed.
Everyone wants me to say something extensively with a note of five hundred thousand rupees.
On 8th November, 8th night, for the proper development of the country, I told you about a great campaign for the nation.
As I made this decision and gave you that decision, I made it clear, it wasn't a common decision, it was a difficult step.
It was very difficult to use and realize this decision.
And I knew that, for this decision, the people have to face new situations.
At the time of the announcement, I warned that the effect of this proposal would be so effective that it would take 50 days to get out of it.
Then we can move towards normalcy.
The disease that has spread for seventy years is not a simple thing to be healthy.
I'm well aware of your hardships.
Even after the effort that has been going on continuously to disturb yourself, you understand the path that is right for the welfare of the country.
I'm getting your incredible support.
I see, all over the world, many geographies, these giant nations, black money, necknotes are charging about all this.
The world's man curiosity is that 125 million Indians can handle such a difficult situation.
It can be in such a situation.
125 crores of Indians have been deeply respected and full faith in their country that they are engaged in universalization for the development of the country.
Our country will turn into gold for citizens of the country.
Because of this, you're the one who made this success journey.
The central government, the state government, the self-resolved organization, the branches of 1 lakh 30 thousand bank, the Lakh Lakh Bank worker, more than one and a half lakh dockers, more than one lakh bank-sympathetic days have been working in this system.
In the midst of the marvel, all these workers are impatient with a great duties of the country and are enjoyed in an unprecedented change.
It's been working in the morning when they're going tonight, they can't even take care of it, they're working.
That's why we're going to succeed.
Is the bank and the dakkeepers working in opponents
And when there's talk of humanity, they're getting more active.
I heard Khandwa's lucky guys needed his money as he was injured in the accident.
That's when the local bank employees ears, they immediately reached the house of Praveen Bhadrlok.
Not only that, he has arranged for treatment.
I'm enthusiastic about this incident.
How many such incidents have spread to other media in newspapers, TVs.
The real identity of your power comes when you face the opponent.
When the Jan-Dhan Yojana Campaign started in the Prime Minister's industry, I saw what the bankers did labor and self-determination.
I've met them.
The work that seemed impossible in 70 years has made it possible.
Today I have faced the same situation and I believe the vision of 125 million people, their men, will make this nation a new power.
But the wickedness is such that some people don't have the habit of evil.
Many of them still think you're gonna find out some way to keep the money, black money, the money, the amount of money incurred.
They're taking different ways to save black money.
I'm feeling worse when I see, they're roaming the poor people to get out of their own odd jobs.
Make the poor fools fooling them, putting money in their bank accounts, saving their money by making them many mischievous.
I can only talk to such odd people, if you don't mind yourself, you're gonna take the law.
One request, don't play the poor people to fulfill their unfair selfishness.
You're tied up by poor people's records, you're not after investigation, these poor people will be ruined, they'll suffer.
A very strict rule has been made to bring the Bennamese composition, which is being realized in all respects.
Because the government doesn't want common citizens to face any kind of problem.
Mr. Ashish telephoned me from Madhya Pradesh to support the fight against black money that has spread through five hundred thousand rupees, my name can be blessed.
I am an ordinary citizen of the district of Madhya Pradesh, Tehsil and Village Tirali.
Your five hundred thousand notes are very commendable.
My request is, "Man Ki Walt", where the common man is facing many problems and welcomes the nation's progress to this step.
This will increase the enthusiasm of the people.
I think the 'Kash Les' system is very important for nationalization.
I'm with the whole countrymen and I'm very happy you've moved to close the notes of five hundred thousand rupees.
"Okay, that's one more call I'm from Sriman Welpa Wellankar of Karnataka.
"Modiji Namskar, I'm calling a village in Koppal district of Karnataka, Welpa Wellankar.
Thank you internally.
You said that Sudin's coming, but no one could think you could take such a big step.
Five hundred and a thousand notes are shut down and you taught the corrupt black markets.
Every citizen of India doesn't have a greater day.
That's why I thank you once more.
"When you hear this kind of news through media, civilized people and government sources, the use of work increases a lot.
It's very joyful and proud to think about the common man of the country.
There is a restaurant at National Highway Six in Akola, Maharashtra.
There's a big board in front of the Orarestore, so that's written: If your pocket has an old five thousand thousand notes and you want to eat, then you won't worry about the money and don't get involved.
Drink your belly and go back to Pasamity when you go through this road.
People went there and ate it, and after two-four-six days, when they returned with the rest of the world, they broke the bill.
This is the power of my country, where the secularism and sacrifice are the chiefs.
The news that I used to communicate was spread all over the world.
The use of the world's most countries was also learned.
But I didn't know that there might be 'Cha-Bethak'
I got the news that this is the same marriage in the morning of November.
In this marriage, there were only tea drinks for the pilgrims, others weren't the feeding and breeding ceremony - because there was lack of cash in order to stop the notes.
The Blacks also support this.
During this kind of marriage, Bharat Maru of Surat established a vision to fight against the evils and black money.
I'm blessed to know the newly married couple.
I'm congratulating them to handle the ceremony like marriage to this great sacrifice.
When the concrete comes, people find new paths.
Once I've seen an incident in Dhekiajuli village of Assam on TV records.
These tea workers are getting weekly wages for the village tea workers.
What did they do when two thousand rupees were loaded
Neighboring four women gathered together and paid a note of two thousand rupees.
They don't need a little corney.
They're gonna fix it in the next week.
People are taking new ways like this.
And the results are also visible.
The government comes to know that the workers of Assam's tea garden are claiming ATM service.
Look how life is changing.
The successful country of this expedition will be the next time, but some people have become profitable right now.
If you ask what happened, I'll tell you we're getting some news from the little town.
Almost forty-fifty towns we've got ourselves that they've been busy shouting so long, that any kind of taxes, dragons, electric bills, snacks - they're giving them all the buckets in the wooden old notes.
You guys well know that poor people have accumulated the narrowest bakeya even before two days.
But rich, powerful people, who know, will never be questioned about them, they're gonna raise their fears.
And that's why the rest continue to grow.
Only fifty percent of every municipality taxes fall.
But after the announcement on the eighth day, the old bakia jamadewa hits the people.
Seventy-five cities have been seen with a hesitation, last year, where three and a half million rupees were deposited, you'll be enjoyed to know that there's got thirteen thousand crores in a week.
Where's three and a half thousand, where's thirteen thousand
That's self-sufficient
Now that all the municipality has got four times accumulated, which will normally be spent in poor clothing arrangements, drinking water arrangements and engagement.
We're getting such a fuss, whose visual sight is coming to us.
Brothers, grams and peasants are the spine of our country's economy.
When we're adjusting every citizen, I want to congratulate the farmers of the country, especially because of this transformation of economy.
I was calculating the seeds of this year.
I've been accounting till the twentieth of November.
I'm glad to see that wheat, pulses or ses have grown in all cases this year as compared to last year.
In all the opponents, the farmers have taken a new way out.
Some important decisions have been taken from the government, where the Chashivas and the villages are being given priority.
There's still some problem, but I believe that the farmers have always dealt with opponents, it's natural misery or something else.
They're not going to follow this time.
Some of our country's businessmen also create opportunities for employment and also participate in economic development.
I made an important decision for them in the budget last year.
Thirdly, the small shopkeepers of the village like the big Mall of the city will be dealing for twenty-five hours.
No law will stop them.
I thought if the big Mall could be twenty-four hours, why wouldn't the poor shopkeepers of the village get that chance
Sufficient purpose has been taken to get their loans through the 'Mudra' plan.
All these small businessmen have been given through the 'Mudra' plan of lakhs of rupees.
Because innumerable people are connected to this small business, they're introducing millions of millions of monetary Lendeen.
But due to this decision, all these youngsters are also inconvenient.
But I see, the customers are serving through the technology, mobile app, mobile bank, credit card etc.
In some cases, trust is being basically worked.
I'd like to say all the younger brothers and sisters, in this event you're associated with the digital world.
Download the bank's app on your mobile phone.
Take care of POS Machine for Credit Card and learn how to trade in the nostrils.
You've seen that the big malls are operating in the technologies.
In the same way, a small businessman can lend Karbar with a simple "User Friendly" technology.
There's no possibility of any confusion, there's a chance to spread.
I'm asking you to join you to create the Cashless Society.
You can take full bunking facility on the mobile phone for commercial delivery and keep the business initiated without the credit of cash notes.
These technologies, which are safe, safe and fast.
I want you to help me to succeed this mission, not to give yourself thirsty.
I believe you can lead this change.
My confidence is that you can finish all business lendeen technology in the village.
I want the workers to say that there's a lot of absorption on you.
It's written in the paper that's a wallet and what the hand is given.
Sometimes it's full surveillance, it's a man standing out there, he's got to divide, and he's forced to accept this absorption as part of life.
Now, in the new system, we'll have your account in the bank, your marishemick's bank, so that the minimum majurie's terminated.
Like you get the full meaning, nobody takes it.
You don't have to absorb.
And once you get your bank account, you don't need a small-smart phone in your mobile... this time you work on your mobile phonemanybag.
That's why I have a special request from the workers' brothers and sisters to this plan because I have taken this decision for the poor, the workers of the country, for the deprived, the victims.
They should get the benefit.
Today I want to talk especially to young friends.
We say that in the whole world, India is a country where 65 percent of the population is thirty-five years old.
You, young people and young men of my country, I know my decision has been unconscious.
I know that you support this decision.
I also know that you will have a lot of contribution to take this thing forward.
But the buddies, you're my real army, real friend.
We have a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India.
There's a need to take the country to the top of economic prosperity.
My young men, can you help me
Just stay with me, it won't work.
You have the idea of today's world, it's not an old generation.
It may be that your family's elder brothers don't know so much, Aurma-Baba, Kaka-Kakima, Mama-Mami, probably don't know so much.
You know how 'Ap' is Kiginis, 'Online Banking', 'Online ticket' booking.
It's simple for you and you use it.
But today the country wants to do great work, our dream is Cashless Society.
It's okay that hundred percent of the castles society is not possible.
But once we can formulate the 'Les-Kash Society', the goal of the Cashless Society will not be underway.
And you need active cooperation, time and imagination.
And if you ever despair me, I know, because we are all citizens who want to change the lives of the poor people of Hindustan.
You know, for the Cashless Society, how much is the opportunity for digital banking or mobile banking today.
Every bank is online.
Every bank has its own mobile app in Hindustan.
There's every bankernisswal wallet.
Walt's white meaning is i Manibag.
A lot of cardpaws go.
Under the Jan-Dhan Yojana, there are crores of poor families in India who have a y card that was used very little.
Since the eighth century, he's been using the poor man and he grew about three hundred.
Pri-paid cards are available on mobile phones, the same card is available for bankruptcy expenses.
This is a big platform, a business valuation of UPI.
You can also send the meaning, whatever you can buy, you can accept the meaning.
And this is so simple as your Whiats Appearance.
The person who didn't teach any writings knows how to send a message to the WhitesApp or how to do the Forward, how to enter it.
Not only this, technology is becoming so simple in the day that no big smartphone is needed for this work.
Castronspher can also be a phone with a common feature.
Dhopa or vegetables, milk, news papers, tea, squirrel salesman. Everyone can use it unnecessarily.
And I suppose to simplify this system.
All the banks are working on it.
And now we have canceled the cost of that online charge.
The cost of such cards, etc., which you have seen in the last two-four-day newspaper, has canceled all the costs, so that the Cashless Society movement can be strengthened.
My young friends, even after all this, there's a whole generation, who's unworthy about this.
And unrassbai, I know well, this great work is active.
Whatever kind of creative massage you give on the Whites App - Slogans, poems, stories, cartoons, new imaginations, lazy-colds, everything in the face of Challenge, the creation of the younger generation, seems to be the specialty of this India that Gita was born in a wartime.
That's how we're gonna show the basic creativity of yours when we're in such a big change.
But my dear youngsters, I'm telling you once again, I need your help in this work and my confidence, you, millions of young people of the country, do this.
Let's do one thing, please today you will be a part of the Cashless Society.
Use the technology on the online phone.
Not just this, half an hour every day, one hour, two hours, at least ten families will understand how to use this technique, how to use your bank's app downloader, how to spend the meaning in your account.
Teach the shopkeeper how to trade.
You're gonna get into this 'Cashless Society', the great campaign to expel the society out of this novel, the campaign to liberate the country from black money, to liberate people from mischief and trouble.
Once you'll teach people how to use RupayCard, poor people will bless you.
By teaching ordinary citizens this arrangement, he will get rid of all the tensions and if all the young people of Hindustan are in this work, I think it will not take much time.
Within a month, we can unite in the world to become a modern Hindustan and you can do this through your mobile phone.
You can go to ten houses everyday, you can connect ten families in this system everyday.
I'm inviting you: Come, not just support, we're soldiers of this change and let's change.
We will take this fight to free the country from evil and blackfalls and there are many countries in the world where young generations changed the lifestyle of that nation and it would mean that the change comes in the young people and young people revolutionize them.
A mobile system named M-PESA, used technology, named M-PESA and today Africa has agreed to change the entire business in Kenya in this area.
This country has made a big revolution.
My young men, I'm back, once again, with great interest, I'm telling you to take this campaign forward.
Each school, college, university, NC-C, NS-S, is inviting you to do this at the personal level.
We take this system forward.
We've got the opportunity to serve the country, we should lose the chance.
Dear brothers and sisters, a great poet of our country, Shri Harivanskari Bachchan's birth anniversary today and today on the birthday of Harivanskari-ji, Mr. Amitav Bachan called for "Swachhta Avihan".
You've seen that the most popular artist of this time, Amitava-ji, is carrying the Swachhtata campaign very hard.
It seems that the cleaning thing has spread to the vein of his vein, so he remembers his cleanliness in his father's birth anniversary.
A poem of Harivansh Ri-ji is like this.
" (Orth, the earth's body, the happy mind, the life of the temporary, this monster.
(Herivansh Ri-ji gave his identity like this.
"Matti Ka Tan, Masti's mind, Tagore Life, Meera Introduction" - His chance son, Mr. Amitav-ji, Johnshira, has spread the cleaning campaign in Shira, he wrote me using the poem of Harivansh Ri-ji.
" (Earthly clean body, clean mind, clean India, my identity.
I'm grateful to Hivansh Ri-ji.
Thanks to Mr. Amitava Bachhan for getting involved in this way and taking the work of cleanliness.
My dear patriots, now you're thinking through the 'Manki Walt', through your thinking letters, reaching the My Gave, the Narendra Modi App and connecting me with you.
Now, at the time of Bella Egro, 'Man What Walt' is broadcast, but after the transmission ends, the arrangement to hear it is going on in the regional language.
I am the gratitude of the AIR, the new industry that took them, so that everywhere in Hindi language, there will be a chance to connect with it.
Thank you all very much
