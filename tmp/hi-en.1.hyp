Mind, January 2019 My dear countrymen, Namaskar
On the 21st of this month , the country received news of deep grief .
Sri Sri Sivakumar Swamiji , the doctor of Shri Siddhaganga Math of Tumkur district in Karnataka , was not among us .
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service .
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us " Kayakve Kailas " means to perform his obligation while hard work, it is like being in the residence of Lord Shiva, Kailash Dham."
Shivkumar Swamiji was a follower of this philosophy and he worked for the social, educational and economic upliftment of thousands of people during his 111 years of lifetime
His fame was as a scholar who had a wonderful hold on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages
He was a social reformer .
He put his whole life in the matter that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge
Farmers should be welfare in every way, it was preferred in Swamiji's life
Siddhaganga Math regularly organised animals and agricultural fairs .
I have sometimes privileged to receive the blessings of the Supreme Lord .
In 2007 , our former President Dr . A . . Abdul Kalam went to Tumkur on the occasion of the centenary year celebration of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swami ji .
On this occasion Kalam Saheb had heard a poem for Swamiji .
He said: My fellow citizens - I
n giving, you receive happpiness, I
En Body and Soul - You have everything to give.I
You have knowledge - share itI
- You have resources - share them with the needy. You, your mind and heart to remove the pain of the suring, And, chair the sad hearts.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life of Sri Sri Shivkumar Swami ji and the mission of Siddhaganga Math beautifully
Once again, I pay my respect to such a great man
My dear countrymen
The Constitution came into force in our country on January 26, 1950 and our country became Republic on that day and yesterday we celebrated Republic Day with honor but I want to talk today
There is a very important institution in our country, which is an integral part of our democracy and is older than our Republic - I am talking about the Election Commission of India
The EC was the establishment day on January 25, which is celebrated as "National Voters Day, National Waters Day"
It is natural for every countrymen to be proud of the Election Commission by looking at the people of the world on the scale on which elections are held in India .
There is no stone unturned in our country to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, is a registered voter - he gets an opportunity to vote
When we hear that voting center is established in the area of 15,000 feet above sea level in Himachal Pradesh, then voting is also arranged in the islands of Andaman and Nicobar.
And you must have heard about Gujarat that in the forest of Gir, in a remote area, a polling booth, which is only for 1 voter
Imagine. Just for a voter
It is very natural to be proud of the Election Commission when they hear these things .
Keeping in mind that one voter, that voter gets an opportunity to use his franchise, for this, the entire team of EC employees go to the far-flung area and arrange voting - and this is the best of our democracy
I appreciate the Election Commission for continuing efforts to strengthen our democracy
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the states, all the security personnel, other employees who participate in the voting process and ensure independent and fair elections
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country, this will be the first time where young people born in the 21st century will use their vote in Lok Sabha elections
They have the opportunity to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders
Now they are going to become part of the decision - making process in the country
The time has come to connect dreams of the country with dreams
I urge the young woman to get registered as a voter if they are eligible to vote
Each of us should realize that becoming a voter in the country, getting the right to vote, is one of the important achievements of life.
It is my duty to vote together - this feeling should grow within us
For any reason in life, if voting is not done then there should be great pain
Sometimes , there should be some misunderstanding in the country .
Yes
I did not vote, that day I did not go to vote - my country is suffering today
We must realize this responsibility .
This attitude, should be our tendency
It must be our rituals .
I urge the well-known celebrities of the country to make people aware that we all together are voter registration, or vote on voting day
I hope a large number of young people will be registered as voters and will further strengthen our democracy with their participation
My dear countrymen, this great earth of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some wonderful, unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is multicultural-Vasundhara
One of the great men was Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose .
On 23rd January , the whole country celebrated Jayanti in a different way .
On Netaji ' s birth Jayanti , I had the privilege to inaugurate a Museum museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to the struggle for freedom of India .
You know that many such rooms, buildings were closed so far from freedom inside the Red Fort
The rooms of those closed Red Fort have been changed to very beautiful museums, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and VIDEO
Dedicated to the National Army
Yad-e-Jaliya
1857 Dighteen ifty Seven, I
Endias Virst of I
Endependence is dedicated to the museum and this whole complex is dedicated to the country as the ' Kranti Mandir ' .
In each brick of these museums, the fragrance of our glorious history is settled.
On the museum of the museum, things that tell the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle inspire us to go inside history
At this place, the British rule had prosecuted India's heroic sons Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillo and Major General Shahnawaz Khan
When I was visiting memories related to Netaji in the Red Fort, in the Kranti Mandir, then Netaji's family members presented me a very special cap, cap
Sometimes Netaji used to wear that hat .
I put that hat in the museum, so that people coming there also look at that hat and inspire patriotism from it
In fact , the bravery and patriotism of his heroes needs to be transformed frequently separately to the new generation .
Just a month ago on 30 December I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands .
In a program, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place, where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there is this tradition on August 15 only
This was the occasion of the completion of 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government .
Subhas Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled organiser .
A brave soldier who played a key role in the fight for freedom
Go to Delhi, "Give me blood, I will give you freedom, like Netaji made a place in every Indian's heart "
For many years, it has been demanding that files related to Netaji be made public and I am happy that we can do this work
I remember that day when Netaji's family came to the Prime Minister's residence
Together we talked about Netaji and paid tribute to Netaji Subhash Bose .
I am glad that efforts have been made to develop many places connected to the great heroes of India in Delhi .
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road connected to Baba Saheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or it is a revolutionary temple
If you come to Delhi then you must see these places .
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, and that too, in the matter of "mind", I want to share a story related to Netaji's life with you"
I have always considered the radio as an important medium of connectivity with the people , in the same way Netaji also had a deep connection with the radio and he had also chosen the radio to communicate with the countrymen .
In 1942 , Subhas Babu started Azad Hind Radio and through radio he used to seize with the soldiers of the Indian Army and the people of the country .
Subhas Babu had a different idea of starting negotiations on radio .
They used to start talking first: "This is Subhash Chandra Bose speaking to you over the Aad Ind Radio and so listening, as if a new zeal, a new energy gets transmitted"
I was told that these radio stations also broadcast weekly news bulletins, which were in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu etc.
In the operation of this radio station MR Vyas ji of Gujarat played a very important role .
Programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes also gave great strength to the warriors of our freedom struggle .
A visual museum is also built in this Kranti Mandir .
It has been an attempt to tell Indian art and culture very attractively .
There are 4 historical ehibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 paintings and art works three centuries old .
Excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Verma, Avnindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Saloz Mukherjee have been performed in the museum .
And I will urge you to go there and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
Now you ' ll be thinking that art is happening here and I ' m talking to you about the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore .
You have yet to go to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as an author and a musician .
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter .
He has made paintings on many subjects .
He has also made pictures of animal birds, he has also made pictures of many beautiful scenario and not only did he work to emerge Chuman Characters through art .
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to most of his works .
He believed that the person who saw his painting himself understood that painting, know the message given by him in painting from his point of view
His paintings have been displayed in European countries, in Russia and in the US
I hope you will visit his paintings at the Kranti Mandir .
My dear countrymen, the land of the saints of India
Our saints have conveyed goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions
Such was a saint , Sant Ravidas .
Ravidas is Jayanti on February 19 .
Saint Ravidas ' s dohas are very famous .
Saint Ravidas gave a greater message through a few lines .
He said, "There is a caste in the species, which is not connected to Ketan's feet, Raidas man unless the caste is thrown of a caste type of banana, then the leave under the leave does not come under the leave and in the end, but the whole tree is over, just like that, the person has also been divided into the castes and the human being is not there."
They used to say that if God is in every human being, it is not appropriate to divide them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas was born on the holy land of Varanasi .
Through his messages , Sant Ravidas tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his lifetime .
It would not be wrong to say that he has explained the world the real meaning of labour .
He used to say , " If the Ganga , if your mind and heart are sacred in Kathauti , God lives in your heart .
The messages of Saint Ravidas ji have influenced people of every section
Whether Chittor's Maharaja and Rani or Mirabai, all were his followers
I once again bow to Saint Ravidas .
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov that I will highlight India's space program and its future related aspects
He also wants me to urge students to take interest in space programs and go somewhere away from the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate the message given to your thoughts and especially for our children
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, where I got the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai
Dr . Vikram Sarabhai has played an important role in India ' s space programme .
Our space program contributes innumerable young scientists of the country
We are proud that today our students are developed satellites and sounding Rockets are reaching space
On 24th January , our students ' Kalam ' set was launched .
Sounding Rockets made by university students in Odisha have also made many records .
As much as Space Mission has been started since the country's independence till 2014, almost the same Space Mission has started in the last four years.
We have also created a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft .
We are going to register India's presence on the moon through the Chandrayan-2 campaign soon
Our country is also using space technology to protect life
Whether it is cyclone, or rail and road safety, all these are getting much help from space technology
NAID Between our Fishermen
Devices have been distributed, which is also helpful in their security as well as economic progress
We are using Space Technology to improve delivery and accountability of government services
Housing for all i . . home for everyone . In this scheme nearly 40 lakh houses of 23 states have been jio-tag .
Along with this about three and a half crore properties were also geo-tagged under MNREGA .
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country
It contributes to our better relations with many countries in the world
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has gifted development to our neighboring friends.
Through its extremely competitive launch services, India today launches not only the developing countries but also the satellites of developed countries.
The sky and stars are always very attractive for the children .
Our Space Program gives children an opportunity to think bigger and move forward from the boundaries, which were considered impossible till now
It's the vision of inspiring our children to watch stars as well as search for new stars
My dear countrymen, I always say, those who played play and this time all the young and young players have come in front of the play in India
About 6,000 players participated in 18 games in India Youth Games playing in Pune in January .
When the local ecosystem of our sports is strong , i . e . when our base is strong , our youth will be able to perform the best of our capabilities all over the world
When the player demonstrates best on the local level , he will also perform best on the global level
This time players of every state have performed well at their respective level in ' Khelo India ' .
The life of many players who win medal is inspiring .
Akash Gorkha , a young player , won the Silver Medal in Mukkabaji .
I was reading Akash's father Ramesh ji, work as a watchman in a complex in Pune
They live in a parking shed with their family
At the same time the captain of Maharashtra's Under-21 female Kabaddi team is resident of Sonali Helvi Satara .
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother promoted Sonali ' s skill .
It is often seen that daughters do not get so much boost in sports like Kabaddi .
In spite of this , Sonali chose Kabaddi and performed the best .
Asansol's 10-year-old Abhinav Shaw, play the youngest gold medal winner in India Youth Games
Akshata Baswani Kamati , daughter of a farmer from Karnataka , won gold medal in weightlifting .
He credited his victory to his father .
Her father is a farmer in Belgaum .
When we are talking about the creation of India , it is New India ' s will of young power .
These stories of Game India are telling that people of big cities are not only contributing to the creation of New India but also young people coming from small towns, villages, towns, youth sporing talents, they also have a big contribution
My dear countrymen, you've heard of many prestigious beauty contests
But have you heard about the contest of shining Toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets have also participated in this unique contest running for nearly a month .
