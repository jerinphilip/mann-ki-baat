Prime Minister Mr.
On November 29, 2015, the Tamilnadu language of the special launch conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population at 11 in the morning.
My heart says the dear countrymen
Good morning.
I hope everybody has celebrated the holidays related to Poet Deepawali.
You'll get the chances to go anywhere.
The business and business will start again and again in the new wake and enthusiasm.
And there must be a plan for Christmas.
Festivals have their own importance in social life.
Sometimes it helps to cut the festivals.
Otherwise they give new energy.
But sometimes there may be complications in celebrations.
It looks very painful.
Repeated news of natural disasters has come from every corners of the world.
We never thought or imagined about these evils.
Now we have experienced how fast the effect of weather change has increased.
In the past, heavy rains, rains, long rains, which have caused a lot of losses in our country, especially in Tamil Nadu.
In other states, it seems to have an inferior consequence.
A lot of people lost their own and lives.
I'm supposed to convince those families in this crisis.
State governments continue to do misery and rescue operations with utmost power.
The central government works with their shoulders.
Now a group of Indians has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I believe in the ability of Tamil Nadu.
I'm sure they can move forward in this trick and continue to play their role in leading the country.
But you have to think about the needs of changes when you see such misery around.
Fifteen years ago, such natural miracles were the only matter of agriculture department.
Because that was the time when all the natural evils were artistic.
I mean, forgiveness was the end of nature's evil.
But today it's changed.
Today, we have to pay attention to each sector.
The government and the society and the people have been working very scientificly to evolve the skills of each small institution.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I am the Prime Minister of Pakistan.
Nawaz spoke to Shariff.
I put forward a suggestion that TAA will work jointly to face the nature of these countries.
I'm very happy to have a seminar and architecture in Delhi about a conference of SARC countries followed.
That's a good start.
Today, I received a message from Punjab's waterfall to Lakhwinder Singh, and I was speaking from Lakhwinder Singh, Jantar district of Punjab.
We're bio-producing here, and most people are aware of bio-geography.
People are burning fire on the fields when they keep cow dung.
My question is to give them the consciousness of how they destroy the microbes on the ground and how they can escape from neighboring Delhi and Haryana and Punjab.
I felt very happy when I heard your question.
The main reason for my happiness is that you're bio-geography.
Not only that, along with biotechnology, you understand the problems of agriculture.
You think it's true.
But it's not right to think it's only happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the nature of all Indians.
We follow the method of burning the ruins of the soil traditionally.
First, we didn't have any sense of such loss.
Everyone does, we do it.
Secondly, it didn't train how to do it.
That's why this method continues.
It's growing.
We're in crisis of weather disruption today.
It's a conversation when this misery began to get affected by the cities.
But your fear is true.
The first way is to train our peasant brothers.
Burning the ruins of the poultry will benefit the time.
The teaching will also benefit.
The next crop can be fielded.
But they're not real.
The ruins of the crop are worthy.
They're really a biography.
We're scratching it.
Not only this, it turns animals into dry food by making small pieces.
Second, they burn the surface of the Earth.
Please think about my farmer brothers for a minute.
Our bones can be strong, our hearts can be strong, kidneys can be good, but what happens if the skin of the body breaks down
Can we live
We can't live if the heart is strong.
It's difficult to live with the skin of the body.
Likewise, the ruins of the soil are burnt by the skin of the Earth, not the ruins.
I mean, we drive our favourite land to death.
So, let's work together.
If these ruins are buried on the ground, it'll be crooked.
Animal food can also be used.
It saves our land.
Not only that, put the shit from the same land there, it gives double profit.
Once I got a chance to talk to the farmers who poured monkeys.
They shared a good experience.
They've been cultivated before.
Hector had to spend five thousand, fifteen thousand and ten thousand to remove the ruins of the poultry after taking the crop.
The ruins of the sword will remain so long as the tractors bring them.
But some farmers buried these ruins of potato into 6-8 inches on the ground.
If there are any trees or plants or crops in the ruins of this sword, they don't need to be wet for three months.
There's so much water in the ruins of the garland.
It's a matter of experience.
The water of those ruins makes the crop alive and the ruins of the potatoes are valuable today.
Farmers have a servitude from the ruins of sweets.
We had to wander to clean the dressed dressed before.
But today it's too much for them.
How much profit can be given to a small test.
Our peasant brothers are not behind any scientists.
My favourite patriots are coming on December 3rd international separation day.
Last time I discussed the organ donation in 'Man Ki Bati'.
He was told about the Helpline of Chhatchha for organ donation.
I found out that the number of phone calls increased seven times after 'Man Ki Bati'.
On 27th November, it was celebrated on the Day of Organ donation.
Many people from the society participated in it.
Filmmaker Ravina Tand has been involved in many famous people.
We can save many lives worthy of organ donations.
In a way, the organ donation provides immortality.
When the organ moves from one body to another, that organ gets new life.
That life gets a new life.
What's greater than this
A registration on the National Level of Organ transplantation started on 27th November for those who are waiting for the transplantation of the organ.
Mygov for the Logo Donor Card, Slogan Design of NET.
In the face, a national level competition was organized.
Many people responded to new ideas.
I believe that every mandal has widespread waking, and I believe that the needy get the best help.
Everyone has to move forward for this.
As I have already mentioned, the international discrepancy is hungry for the day of December 3.
Physically, mentally distinct, immense will and courage.
They feel sorry when they're scared.
Sometimes they express mercy and compassion.
But if we change our mood, we can inspire them to live if they change their sight.
We start crying when it's a little difficult.
I think how they live, our pain seems to be so small.
How do they live
How do you work
They're always the source of inspiration.
Their determination, the way of living, their enthusiasm to make the tricks capable is appreciable.
Today I want to talk about Javed Ahmed.
He is 40, 42 years old.
In 1996, the terrorists shot him in Kashmir.
He survived miraculously if he was a victim of the gun of the terrorists.
But one of his kidneys was destroyed.
A part of the intestine was lost.
The spinal cord was severely damaged.
I lost the ability to stand in my own legs.
And yet he didn't agree.
The wound of terrorism didn't defeat him.
A cruel man had to face so much trouble without any reason.
Youngness is lost.
But he doesn't feel sorry, terrible, sad.
They all became sensitive.
He gave his life for social service.
He hasn't been able to cooperate with his own body, but he has been able to teach children for 20 years.
How to improve the compliance of physically discrepancied people, provide facilities in public places and government offices.
I'm trying all this.
He's back to that direction of his teaching.
He took graduation in the social workers.
As a social serviceman, as an awakening citizen, he continues to be silent in society as a prophet of discriminatory.
What, Javed's life is not enough to inspire every corner of India
I remember Javed Ahmed's life, his penance, his dedication on December 3.
I'm talking about Javed because of lack of time, but in every corner of India, such inspirations are burning.
Our country is very big.
There are lots of things that depend on the government.
The middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the poor, the poor, the sad, the slaves, the slaves, the government has to be constantly connected with the government.
In a civilian life sometimes there is a bad experience from government officials.
More than one experience changes our vision of the government's affairs throughout life.
It's true.
However, millions of people in this government are working with service and devotion.
But sometimes it doesn't appear in our eyes, we never know.
Because it's natural.
It's been done by government system or government officials.
There's a chain of peasants today, along with India.
But I haven't heard much about them among the people.
Perhaps you can't hear.
But the achievement of the world famous plan called Bilgate Foundation's family component is a model.
India honored Bilgates and Milinda Bilgates for this specific action.
They're doing a lot of social work in India.
They don't show anything to change their lives to the poor and the evil people.
They come to India all the time.
See peasants.
Try to work together with them.
Congratulations.
They don't miss the chance to promote them.
Sometimes they say, how much the peasants work with immortality.
How important is their dedication.
The peasants show how much enthusiasm is to learn new things.
We're very proud to share all such good things with the Bilgates family.
The Odyssey governor honored a teacher in the official program.
A small village of Balasore district of Orissa is 'Temdagaon'.
That's where a monk's active motivation takes place.
The only tribal classes are in this area.
The dogmatic divisions here are very poor, and malaria diseases are common here.
The 'Jamuna Mani Singh', who was the peasant of this village, worked with the view that no one of the Temdagaon region will die due to malaria.
Even if anyone in the village heard a small fever, he ran everywhere and gave them medical care and worked as one of them.
Every house taught the villagers to use mosquitoes.
In order to take care of how much a mother would take care of her child to sleep properly, she used to treat 'Jamunamansing' as a humor for every village.
They attacked Malaria in the joint.
It has succeeded in liberating the village of Malaria.
Like them, many 'Jamunamanis' might still be proud of our country.
Millions of millions of people may be working in our surroundings.
Nobody has any doubt about how much power we have in our country.
If you see the patients with love, what's the pleasure
They're getting partners in the comfort of society
I appreciate the name of 'Jamunamani', all the peasants working in such a way.
I respect everyone.
My dear young friends, I was actually alive for young men in internet and social programs.
Mygov.
I've got three la-books in.
One of them 'L'-Buck Swachh is the inspirational events related to India, the second about the honors of the participants and the third about health care and health care.
I'm trying to tell you, you'll see them all right.
And give it to others.
Be careful with reading.
Increase and share good instructions and good ideas.
You must be mygov.
Sending Lake in.
Sometimes some of the factors in the society cannot be taken care of by everyone, and you can take care of such things.
They're very useful for society.
Positive sides are empowering our society.
You can share such good things with me.
So don't hesitate to share the e-books.
As soon as the books are subjected to more discussions, some of the youngsters have to tell the students of eight or nine or ten classes, what happens here, and that's going on.
And you're actually becoming a good teacher of a society.
I'm welcomed some of you to the nation's creation.
My dear countrymen, today all over the world are worried about climate.
Climate and globalization are being discussed everywhere.
And before everything begins, everyone agrees that the temperature of the Earth should not rise anymore.
I don't care what we're thinking about.
Becoming partners in this mission, we are responsible for each other.
The only way to stop globalization is energy conservation.
December 14 is the National Energy Security Day.
The government is moving forward with various methods for energy protection.
The DD bulb plan is being implemented.
I'm reminded of you once again, I'm gonna be in full moonlight for hours by snatching the streets at night.
Enjoying the incredible moonlight is so funny.
My friend who led me to share this rare experience sent me a zink to see and see it.
Based on that, I'm telling you this.
But its credit is actually entitled to Lee News.
Because this zink, Lee News was mine.
T. Nurjahan, a woman from Purpur.
V.
I didn't even see it.
They didn't have much chance to learn.
But if they say something they did, there'll be no others who think about it.
They are engaged in the process of bringing light to the poor people in their land with solar energy.
They fought against darkness and ignored their name.
They built a platform of Rantal, illuminating with solar energy through a group of women.
They're paying Rantal to the territorial compatriots for a hundred rupees per month.
The people buy Rantal in the evening and give them back to charging again in the morning.
Many people, i.e. 500 families are carrying Rantal every day.
Each house is sufficiently transporting electricity through this scheme which costs only three or four rupees.
Noorjahan is trying every day for a recharge to burn Sauroraj Rantal in his plan.
It's an extraordinary pattern.
I don't care how much you're shouting.
We know what the greatest people of the world do about the weather changes.
But how many women help the nurjahan who doesn't ceremonially.
Who's inspiring.
But if there are many such surveillances, it can be lighted in the world.
I'm enjoying this opportunity to appreciate them, not only for the poor families of yourselves, but to enjoy the light and mind.
Jee Tuck my appreciations.
The significance of the event that took place in a Kugram in Coppuar is a balanced part of the nation and the nation.
Thank you very much for Lee News.
Mr. from Uttar Pradesh.
Abhishek Kumar Pande called me on the phone.
I'm speaking Abhishek Kumar Pandey from Gorkhapur.
I'm an industrialist here.
Are you planning a 'Mudra Bank' for us
I appreciate that.
Like me, many businessmen want to know from you, what kind of money bank is helping the workers
Thank you for Abhishek, called from Gorakhpur.
Prime Minister Mudrayojan's 'Fond the Unfunded' means providing fundamentals to non-professional workers.
In this way, we mean in simple language, 3 - i.e. operationality, richness, education (nterprises, burning, employment) encouraging the immunity operationality.
Mudra gives a chance to communicate.
In fact, Modra Shakti is performed.
There are many plans to help those who move with small gardens.
I'd like to get this plan as soon as possible.
But the beginning is very good.
Within a very short time, 66 lakh people have been able to get 4,5,000 crore rupees (42,000 crore rupees) through the Prime Minister's Modra plan.
Let's get involved in this, let's be a journalist, make milk, and those who are employed will get the real benefit.
There are more and more dogmatic dogs involved in small operations.
They're trying to move the family with self-confidence from their feet.
Abhishek shared his happiness.
There's a lot of things coming in front of me.
The other is from Mumbai to Shilesh Bhosla.
He's got eight and a half million rupees (8.
5 lakhs of loans.
He started the job of cleaning the sewage dress with this money.
I said at the time of our Swachh Bharat Programme, the new mission is to come in the middle of the project.
But Shilesh Bhosle has succeeded in bringing it to work.
He's taken a tanker and worked two lakh rupees back to the bank from the income.
This is the victory of the Modra Yojana.
Many of these people have benefited from the plan.
The matter of Mother Sharma from Bhopal is also very pleasant.
With the prime minister's print plan, he has been engaged in the process of reaching the market by making a perse.
But if they were very clever to withdraw money for the predecessor, then the situation has changed now.
Now, with good money together, they are happy to do good business without any curiosity.
They say that if it is difficult to go ahead because of more interest and salvation and more than a few, then today it will be worth more than a thousand rupees per month.
And a good business in their family is slowly expanding.
But no one knows about this plan.
So more propaganda is necessary.
Our banks must be more popular.
Ordinary people have to provide their benefits and help.
In fact, it's a common man to lead our composition.
It's the people who run small things, the real economic power of the country.
I want to give them more reinforcement.
I have to do good things.
My dear countrymen, on the day of the victory of Sardar Patel on October 31, I had discussed 'One Indian Best India'.
There must be some things to keep the society constantly aware.
'National awareness version' is the ternal vigilence of the emotional literacy of the nation's unity.
I want to form a plan for 'Ek India, Best India'.
My.
Gov has asked for its instructions.
How to be the structure of the program
How to be Logo
How can we make this partner
What's the size
I asked people's instructions.
Now there's a lot of instructions coming.
But I'm expecting a lot of instructions.
There's a lot of basic plans.
Those who are active in this will receive the honorary papers.
And other gifts have also been announced.
You also use this activity.
The solidarity and unbrokenness of the nation is to unite each Indian, one of the greatest Indians.
What can the government do for this
What will the general community do
There are so many things.
I have full confidence. Your instructions and actions will be defined.
My dear brothers, the winter months are on.
But you can find a pleasure to eat in this cold.
I'll find you a pleasure to slid the blankets.
But I want to exercise the cold.
In order to make the body healthy one should exercise and yoga according to the weather .
Make a good atmosphere in the family and make a festival and join all the people in exercise.
You can recognize how much Chaitanya's excitement is.
The whole day, the body will be more provocative.
If you're a good weather, you'll have a good habit.
We'll get together in a healthy pleasure.
My dear folks, you're gonna have better once more.
Jai Hind.
