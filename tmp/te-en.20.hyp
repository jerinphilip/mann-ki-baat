On the 25th of June 2017 in Akashwani, the Prime Minister 'Man Ki Baat' (Speak in Mansu) program will be completely devoted to my country Vasulara, Namaskara, Vatavaran.
This time there are more sunshine.
But the atmosphere has completely changed when the year's season comes.
In some places of the country, the bullshit has become a descendant.
It's been a few days since the years were overwhelmed by the rains.
It's a matter of confusion.
The so much of the mind is in conflict, it's a stress- it wants a self-life or a public life - it's an experience that enjoys the excitement of years.
In many places of the country Jagannath Rath Yatra is being expressed with so much sacred spirit .
This festival is now celebrated in some places of the world .
The innumerable classes of the country have felt happy with Lord Jagannath .
The life of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, who read the books written by him, is observed to praise Lord Jagannath's gods, the traditions of that temple.
Because, social justice, social equality are broken in both of these.
Jagannath Bhagwan is the God of the Lord of God.
Many people can't know, but there's a juggernaut in English.
This is the meaning of the unhappy Divorced Rath.
The juggernut duration in the nigh is taken from Jagannath Rath.
It is the reason for the journey of Jagannath Rath across the country to roam according to the communications.
Jagannatha Bhagwani's Rath Yatra in the month of the month of the day, I'm charming cleanliness for all the people of the country.
Bhagwan dedicated prayers to Jagannath's Charanarvind.
The weight of the country is also one of the oneness in the variation of specificity.
This is also the power of the human country.
Pavita Ranjana is praying for the month of Prajala.
It's 'Id' birthday.
Id-ul-Fitr is probably giving you a lot of salutations for me.
The month of charity, the charity of charity, is very pure.
It's the fate of winning happiness.
The souls are so happy that they are duplicated.
Come on, let's get the joys of joy inspired by this sweet festival, all the minds of Kalicka.
Please make the country happy.
A magnificent incident in Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in the province of Uttar Pradesh begins in my memory.
About three and a half thousand Muslim Soddar, a family of Sodrimans lived in that small village.
If you say a word, the most junabatic guys in that folk are Muslim Soddar, Sodriman.
This runaway has determined the construction of the dwellings of all the villagers.
The construction of an indispensable barricades has also given them the financial support of 17 lakh rupees.
After knowing this thing, you will also enjoy joy with surprise.
The Muslim Soddar, who lived around this festival in the month of Ranjan, strolled the courage of 17 lakhs.
He gave it back to the government.
We're gonna beat the bastards that build up for a single mom all week.
The ducks say Mave Shram donation is also Made.
These 17 lakh rupees could be used for the development of Maro village.
In this context, all the villagers of Mubarakpur are honored to take a magnificent scrutiny.
They're inspired by the inspiration of a single pair of them.
The most important thing is that Mubarakpur has been converted into a foreign exchange of Bahiranga Mala all over the way.
There are three countries in the country of Man.
Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Kirla states, it has been exposed to non-visional provinces of Bahiranga.
In this week, Uttarakhand, Haryana also reached this list.
I'm giving every kind of gratitude to the officers who are in charge of the properties of these five states.
The work they did is very amazing.
But in the busy life.
But in social life.
That's what you need to do a good piece, it's gonna have to try a lot.
Get the man's hand to the rock right, so that it's gonna have to be tried for a long time.
Then the habit of glory doesn't change.
It's also like a fucking thing.
The fuss of shit for purification has turned into a part of his life.
Abstain from such sad exercises has to be tried continuously.
Prati has to raise this thing in every mind.
It's the need to put the moisture of the fantastic congress to inspire.
In today's situation, the activity of purification could not be compensated for the dominion.
It turned into a garden in Prajalandari.
This thing made me so happy.
The people who are singing in the land are also going ahead with the civilization of the people.
It's gonna make a lot of mercy.
A magnificent event that happened a few days ago is buzzing in my mind.
Keep it in front of you.
This incident took place in the Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
The government carried out an extraordinary work with the participation of the people.
On 10th March, from 6th morning to 14th morning, 10 hours in the morning, continuous campaign was organized with 100 hours.
Its goal is to build 10 thousand schools in 71 gram panchayat during 100 hours.
Lovely my country, Vasulara, during hundred hours, the government, the people, who were successful in building ten thousand schools together, will give you a terrible joy.
71 villages have turned into unlimited villages.
For the people working in governments, the government officials, the citizens of that village of Vijayanagar, I'm very much appreciated.
They're all together trying to make Bhagirath appearances to others.
In the recent days, I've been receiving a lot of advice from people who are talking about 'Mansu Bath'.
Some suggestions are coming to the NarendraModiApp.
And some more advice is MyGov.
Coming in.
The answers are showing.
The advice is also coming from the skyway.
Mr. Prakash Tripathi wrote a letter reminding the urgent situation.
June 25th is considered to be a artistic period in democracy history.
The glory of Sri Prakash Tripathi in the field of democracy, Jagrukta is admirable.
Democracy is not just a system.
Anything.
Continuous awareness is needed for democracy.
That's why we're gonna have to worry about democracy.
Please put an end to the good things related to democracy.
June 25, 1975, turned into a Kalaratri.
A man who loves democracy doesn't forget this tribe.
The Indians can't forget it.
In a way the whole country was converted into prison by the government.
During the Emergency, the court system was also scared of fear.
The newspapers closed their mouths.
People working in newspapers, students, people working in democracy are reminding that artistic tribe again and again.
Trying to be constantly aware of democracy's security.
Such efforts should continue like this, Suma.
At that time Mr. Atal Bihari Waz Pai was also lodged in Karag.
It's been a year since Emergency.
Then Mr. Atal wrote a poem on Bihari Waz.
In that poem, they describe the condition of the art.
The best month was very happy.
The shrine of the Sharath period of Sharath , the shrine of the Kaumudi Shravan month , has passed on a very square , and the sound of the song of the birds lying down from the birds lying in the houses of the foxed birds lying from the birds drowned .
Like a poem.
People who worship democracy fought hard.
India is very large.
On receiving the chance, all the people of India have declared their grace to be digested in the nerves of democracy.
Your strength was shown during the election.
This feeling spread in the nerves of the people is traditional to us.
We have to strengthen this tradition more.
Lovely my country, every Indian is roaming at the height of the world before.
Our country seems to be a humiliation.
2017 June 21st of the world has become worthy.
During the time of Prabhat across the mountains all people welcomed the sun rays .
This thing is the grave cause of all Indians.
It doesn't mean that people don't know about yoga before.
Even today people are bound in the yoga syllabus.
The source of the whole world has finalized the yoke.
All countries worldwide have put yogas on 21 June.
In China the Great Wall of China has been yogged.
In Peru , the World Heritage Saint of Machu has made the people of Yog at a height of 2 thousand 400 metres above sea level .
Yog was at Eiffel Tower in France.
In UAE, more than 4 thousand people in Abu Dhabi have collective yoga.
In the Herat of Afghanistan, India has done yoga on the famous Salma Setu of Afghanistan.
By doing so, new fraternity has been added to the affection of the Ubayas.
In a small area like Singapore, there were programs in ten places.
A week's promotion programmed.
During the International Yoga Day celebrations, the United States Committee (UN) released ten Tapala stamps.
The discussion was held with Yoga teachers at the UN headquarters.
The government staff of the UN, all the people of the Dutch office are involved in it.
This time Yoga has made records of the world.
In Ahmedabad of Gujarat about 55 thousand people have created a new world record by doing yoga together .
I got the chance to participate in the yoga program in Lucknow.
But, I'm lucky to do yoga in the first rain.
Our soldiers yogged in Siachen, which had a temperature of 20, 25, 40 degrees.
But our armed forces, but the border security forces, but the IBP soldiers, but not the CRPF troops, but the CISF soldiers.
Everyone is involved in the yoga program.
During this third International Yoga Day celebration, I would like to send photographs related to it to three classes of a family.
There are reports related to it in some TV channels.
I got lots of photos.
Some of them were preserved in the NarendramodiApp.
We have a clear point in this event of worldwide yoga discussions.
By doing yoga our society, which takes care of health , reaches a safe state of health .
We get health from yoga.
Together with this, we have to assume that yoga is a miraculous means for safety.
(Sound Bate) "Governed Chief Minister, from Ahmadabad in Gujarat, I'm talking to Dr. Anil Sonara.
You want me to put a question.
You said one thing in Kerala.
We describe the flowers of guests in various programs.
Please give books instead.
It stands as a memory symbol.
You started this process in your office in Gujarat.
But recently we don't see such a tradition anywhere.
We could do anything for this.
Why should we not do any effort for this
What can we do about it being implemented throughout the country
He spoke to him, sir.
A few days ago, I attended a very fond program.
Many good events are held in Kerala .
P.
Anyone.
Workers organized the Foundation program.
In order to increase the reading of books in people, this fountain radioday has been done to increase the awareness of books.
I have the luck to go to that program.
In place of books instead of flowers.
I like it so much.
I have the chance to remind the missing freaks of the corners.
In Gujarat, when I became the Chief Minister, I decided to give books instead of flowers.
Or would you like to welcome your hand hair.
That hand hair is made of empty.
We should also encourage the Khadi movement.
In Gujarat, the time I was in charge of this tradition.
It turned into a habit.
This habit has been misplaced by coming here.
After coming to Kerala again the habit was made.
I started giving orders to the government officials immediately.
Gradually it should turn into a part of our nature.
A flower shit goes on for a while.
Let's take it once, then leave it again.
But, that's not what the book is about.
It becomes part of our house.
A part of the family changes.
Welcome to empty handkerchief so many people will help us.
The cost also goes down.
The right thing is useful.
I'm explaining such things.
They have historical values.
When the last week went to London, the British ueen Elizabeth told me to eat.
There is a terrible atmosphere of maternal arteries.
Suddenly the queen gave birth to a guest.
Then she gave me that little handkerchief.
It's the hair made of cotton.
She shines a glimpse in her eyes if she gives me.
She explained that on the occasion of her marriage, she gave this hand hall to herself Mahatma Gandhi, and she said that it was sufficiently lost.
It is surprising to preserve the ueen of Elizabeth who gave Mahatma Gandhi.
When I went, she wanted to touch it, showing me those jokes.
She was left a historical thing in her life without a child given by Mahatma Gandhiji.
I know such good habits coming tonight.
We don't have a few people who reflect ourselves when they say such things.
How many observations are to continue.
Try to continue.
It doesn't mean that if someone wants to give me a flower blanket, it doesn't mean it.
These observations continue.
We have to continue our efforts.
Slowly changes in the situation.
Lovely, my country's Vasulara, the Chief Minister has a lot of work to me.
Get lost in the files.
But, I have a habit.
Every day I read something in the north of coming to me.
These are the answers that raise my relationship with the common people.
There are different answers.
I got a answer.
I'm sure you want to say about this answer.
In a remote Tamil narrative, a guru from Madurai city, Arul Mulli Sharavanan said a reply to me.
I hoped to be financially strong with some effort keeping in mind my children's educational institutions.
I think my family wants to use hot water as a shine.
Taking money from the bank and thinking about selling some things.
So the part of the Government e-Marketplace created by the Central Government has moved in my mind.
I asked for everything for it.
I've been under investigation.
I've registered my name in that summit.
Let me tell you one thing to all Indians.
You also go to the site called EGEM on the Internet.
There's a new kind of arrangement.
If any government wants to supplement small things like bulbs, dustbins, chippers, chairs, tables, sellers, register their names in it.
Write about the quality of things at yourself.
How much should you explain its cost.
Government officials must go to this site.
We need to identify people selling goods worth cheaper.
Give orders to the person to send the material.
There's no shape here for luxury.
There's absolute sympathy.
There's no place for confrontation.
Everything becomes clear on the basis of technology.
In EGEM, the authorities of the government will surely examine the irregularities of the registers.
Due to non-middle classes, carpet goods are available.
This Arule Mulley Madam has also recorded the list of things sold on this website.
The answer written to me is very amazing.
I got the money through the Mudra Passam, she said.
My business started.
I've got all the details of the girls at the EGIM.
I got an order from the Chief Minister's Office.
She's bought two flasks in her head office in the north.
The payment of 1600 rupees for these trunks was also given to me.
This is the real authority.
We have to encourage salty industries.
Arull Mulley doesn't know the possibility of doing a woman business in a remote area through the EGEM process.
It's special for her access to the Chief Minister's office.
This is the strength of our country.
It has abstraction.
Registrated month.
There's an attempt to launch a new movement.
People who sell their cooks at you can use EGEM facilities.
The government will be there.
The regime only triggers.
That's the same example.
Easy things are available at cheap prices.
Efficiency grows.
Paradise will grow.
Lovely my country, Vasulara, on one side, we're pretending about yoga.
We're sending satellites successfully to space on the other side.
It's also the pride of us.
On one side, our legs stood on the ground covered with yoga.
Our dreams are just crossing the skies in the smooth sky.
We've done a lot of miracles in the field of sports, science science for a few days.
Our India has developed not only on the ground but also on the slum.
Two days ago, ISRO has sent 30 nono satellites to space.
Along with India, 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America are also involved in this effort.
With the help of these nano satellites, there can be many details in the farming.
There's information about nature's opponents.
The event happened a few days ago is stirring in my memory.
Isro Jishot successfully used 19.
It's very boring in satellites sent to India's space.
All our newspapers in India have described this satellite as the weight of the elephant.
MARS MISHENTING IN the 19th of June finished thousand days.
You know the whole thing we chose successfully a place in space for Mars Mission.
This mission period is 6 months.
That satellite's even six months of life.
Six months have passed since our Mangalian Mission worked more.
Passing photos.
I'm asking for information.
Indicates data related to science.
It's been working for a longer time than the missing extravagance.
Finishing thousand days is an important step in space travel.
These days we've got the progress of the playground.
Our youth's interest in playing is increasing day by day.
Along with studies, young people are also participating in sports programs.
All these are tarnished for the future of their joys.
Our sportsmen reached the gravity of our country's playground with victory.
Our fame has spread all over the world.
Recently, our country's Bedminton player, Mr. Kidambi Srikanth, obtained a destination in Indonesia Open.
Our fame invented the sequence.
This great victory was appreciated by Srikanth, his coach with heart.
A few days ago, the queen of the race, P.
T.
I got the chance to participate in the synthetic track program at Usha School of Athletics established by Ushji.
According to the importance of giving us to the sports sector , sportsmen are increasing their sports .
Sports in the development of personality play a wonderful role.
Sports are very important in the creation of an overall person.
There is no dearth of immunity in our country.
If you like children in our family, give them chances to the playground.
Bring them from the playground, they don't have to be converted into books germs.
They must finish the field of sports along with studies.
Students should be encouraged at school, college, everywhere in the family, if they are interested in the sports.
During the coming Olympics, all Indians should move forward in the direction of new dreams.
Lovely my country, Vasulara, has given us so much enjoyment this rain swelling with the atmosphere of festivals again.
At this time the feeling of ours is sweet.
And once again all of you have my salutations.
Let's talk to Manki Bath in the 'Mansu' program.
Namaskara.
