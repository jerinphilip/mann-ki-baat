Mankibath: My favorite patriot, nice to all of you
The fools have passed away while talking to all of you through the skywalk.
That's 36th mark in your mind.
In a way, the ideas, hopes, aspirations filled in all parts of India, a favourable power is a word in this mind.
There are complaints from some places but I have given me a very magnificent opportunity to drown all the thoughts of people.
They didn't say words in my mind anymore.
The word in this mind is linked to the heart of the country.
Their feelings, their hopes and aspirations.
In this mind, I say the snakes are not the people sent me from all over the country.
And that's too short to say, I can't share a few words with you, but I've only got a deal of things.
Through this-mail, through telephone, through mygow, these words reach me through the NarendramodiApp.
Most of them would inspire me.
Many are like bringing changes to government.
There are some personal complaints, some common problems that keep an eye on.
Once in a month, I'm taking your evening for half an hour, but people are only sending their words for words thrice a month.
That's why the result of which the government also became sympathetic.
Any powers in the remote areas of society have been tried to visualize them.
That's why the journey in this mind of the foolish people is the journey of all the feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
At such a short time, I'm telling the grateful memory of all the people of the country to give me the chance to understand the general feelings of India.
Every time I speak in mind, I remember the words of ఆచార్య Vinobha.
Professor Vinobha's ever called "-, "".
That'll be beneficial only if it's government.
I've always tried to keep people the mainstream in mind.
I saw the color of the royalty without it.
Whenever there's so much rapidness in the circumstances, the axis, I've tried to join you with a stable mind.
Now the fools are fulfilled so social scientists, universities, research scholars, media experts must demonstrate it.
Well, both of you'll look at it.
But in the future of such an observational discussion there is a lot of use in the mind .
A perfect temperament, provides new excitement.
When you eat-- think of how much we need, eat when we're right.
I told you once in the word 'Mansu' that we shouldn't spoil things.
Then I have many answers to say that many social organizations, many young people, are doing such works before the country.
I'm very funny, I'm so happy to see how many people think they're gonna do it.
On the other hand, I told you about a teacher, Shri Chandrakant Kulkarni, who broke the tenth in Maharashtra.
Taking five thousand rupees from the tenth thousand pension he received, he owed 51 post-detade checks for the pledge.
That's why everyone came forward to do such a thing after purification.
Another time I saw a photo of Selfie with a serpent in Haryana, talking to everyone about it.
Not only in India but also in Yavat world has started a big festival called ' Self-wit-dater'.
It's not just social media, Talu.
This is the event of a new self-confidence, all new cowards in every girl.
Every parents feel like they should take your daughters off.
Every girl has something important in her, she believes she's important.
A few days ago I was sitting in the Government of India in their tourism department.
I told the people who went there to travel incredible India to send photographs and send them there.
Then millions of pictures that came from the border areas of India also stood very big on the day of the working of the tourism sector.
I've experienced the word that a small event can be raised.
My mind moved a lot of events in Wacket as soon as the foolish thoughts were fulfilled.
The country will never be before to walk in the right direction.
Every man in the country wants to do something for the progress of the country, to be good for society, for the companionship.
It's my foolish words in the publicity of the nation, learned, learned, learned.
That's the biggest investment, the greatest power for any country.
I'm greeting everybody in the country.
Once I talked about Khadi in mind.
I said it wasn't a dress, a thought.
In the midst of this time, I saw people growing interest in Khadi.
I didn't ask you to desperate the nature, but ask why you should not add a empty dress in your used variety.
Gono, Carten, dude, at least okay.
And then I saw the increase in interest in the young man.
The empty girls grew up.
That's why they got necessary treatment in poor houses.
Discounts are given in empty girls about two October.
There's a lot of reduction.
I'm asking you to raise this empty propaganda, just like this.
Show the lamps of Deepavali in the houses of the poor, buying empty clothes.
We'll work with this feeling.
Our country's poor people have a power to do this work.
We should do that too.
Due to the increased interest in the Khadi sector, the enthusiasm of thinking in a new measurement in the Khadi government, in the Khadi sector.
How to bring new techniques , how to increase the productive energy , how to bring the handicrafts working with the energy , how to revive the ancient tradition which is closed down from 20-20 , 25-25 , 30-30 , etc .
In the Savapuri of Uttar Pradesh Varanasi district the Khadi Ashram which was closed from 26 square feet has been renovated .
Joined many trends.
A lot of people have emergences.
The training center of closed Khadi and rural industries has been restored in the Pampore of Kashmir .
There's a lot of work in Kashmir to give this color.
Now, during the resumption of the training center, new waves will be helpful in building, moving, doing new things.
In the middle of this big corporate organizations like Deepawali, I'm very happy to choose empty things.
People also started selecting empty things when they gave each other gifts.
Some things came into our experience as usual go ahead.
My favorite countrymen, in the last month, we all made a vision.
We decided to celebrate the cleanliness of the country from ten days before Gandhi Jayanti .
I think people are mixed with cleanliness.
Our honorable President started this program.
Yawat is the same country.
Children, elders, men, women, cities, villages, everybody participated in the promotion of practisation.
"I'm telling you that I can gain the equation, we're looking at the front of the way this comprehensive propaganda."
Everyone accepts this propaganda, supporting it, facilitating its partnership.
That's why I'm telling the grateful President.
Along with them, every section of the country also considers it to be its own work.
Everyone has been involved in this propaganda.
In the field of sports, film industry, scholars, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, girls, officers, policemen, children, soldiers, everybody joined it.
There's a turmoil in the universal places.
If these places are ruined, people don't wake up.
This obstacle is also seen in the workers there.
It's very good.
More than five lakh people, more than 40 thousand people have participated in these programs in the four days of the popularity of purity service .
Some are constantly working with the goal of showing the consequences.
This time we've seen another new communication... performing a practical program, taking precautions on the other side.
If you want to change the clarity as a nature, the emotional movement is also necessary.
This time many competitions have been made by purity service.
More than two and a half thousand children are involved in this purification campaign competition.
Thousands of children made pictures.
Pictures about clarity from your own guess.
Many poems come.
I distribute the pools sent by little kids to me through social media.
I'm shining them.
I'm not forgetting the media's thanks to them when the plaintiff came.
They carried this propaganda so sacred.
Their propaganda in their methods has supported them to create a favourable environment.
They're still empowering the pledge in their methods.
We're seeing the Electronic Media, Print Media in our country in the pursuit of service.
Someone told me about the young man of this study called Bilal Dar of Sri Nagar.
You will be happy to know that this Billal Dar has been appointed as his brand ambassador for the sake of the Union of Srinagar .
Brand Ambassador i.e. he's from the film industry, you can think of the hero of the playground.
Nothing.
Billal Dar looked at the cleanliness of his twelve-five years of age, last week.
The largest lake in Asia is located in Srinagar .
There's plastic, polythene, used battales, bitches, all are cleaning this shit.
He's also got the best option with them.
If his father dies with cancer in his childhood, he's a young man who's bestowed upon his life's life.
It's a possibilities that the Balal sector cleared more than twelve thousand kilometers.
I appreciate the Ganu Srinagar City Relationship to think of Brand Ambassador, so much to be appreciated.
Besides being a major tourist spot of Srinagar , it is very important to have such cleaning programs in Srinagar , the city which wants to go everybody in India .
Besides calling Billal as Brand Ambassador, he gave him an organization vehicle, UNIFARM.
Bilal goes to other places and gives adequate training to pursue cleanliness.
Presenting the inspiration, people hiding into the work they'd be immediately.
He's inspired everybody who's interested in purification at a younger age.
Beautiful many joys of Billal Dar.
We must admit that my favorite patriotism, the future history, is born in past history.
If history comes, it's natural to remember the great men.
The month of October to remember all the great men.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, all the great men are in front of us.
Even twenty weeks, we've shown our way for twenty-one centuries.
Consolidated.
Waiting guidance.
He's facing many problems for the country every week.
On the second day of October, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri Gar's victory, then 11th Jaiprakash Narayan, Nanaji Country's flag hoist.
The victory of the teacher of the 25th Pondiot Thene Dayal.
This time Nanajijiji, Pandit Din Dayalai's century year too.
Do you know what is the center of all these great men
A common thing in everyone is to survive for the country, do anything for the country.
Besides being advisory, they are the greatest people who have been observed by their life.
Gandhiji, Jaya Prakashji, Deen Dayal Garu, who lived a minute while staying miles away from the massacre.
"Bahujan Hatha-Bahujan Sukhaya" has been doing something for freedom.
Nanaji's country's face has left the political life, gathered in the village work.
It is natural to have respect for their village programs to celebrate their independence.
Former President of India Shri Abdol Kalan used to talk to young people about the rural development of Nanaji National Mukhji.
They were glorifying so much.
They went to the villages to see the programs carried out by themselves.
The teacher of Din Dayal, who was like Mahatma Gandhi, was also talking about the person sitting in the last sequence of society.
The Teacher of Din Dayal was also asking for a change in the last sequence of the society by the education of those who were suffering from poverty, humiliation, immortality and robbery.
It's not for them to remember all the great men.
We're getting the way to move ahead.
We have to run in the right direction.
I'm sure I'm talking about Sardar Balbhai Patel in Man Ki Bath.
On 31 October the whole of the country run for university is the best country of India .
In every city of the country, run for unity should be organized at a great height.
The weather is also very charming to run.
It's necessary to get the power of the smoke of the smoke.
He united the country.
We also run for unity, run the unity magic ahead.
Equality in diversity generally speaks of our India's specialty.
We respect diversity, but have you ever tried to feel this differentity
I'm going to say everyday that we're in a single wake-up.
Enjoy the distinctives of India, explore them, please deliberate their sympathies, especially with our youth.
You see, your personality can also change the distinctions of our country as big schools.
We're spending holidays.
It's falling near Deepavali.
There's so much in the idea of traveling somewhere in the country.
It's normal for everyone to go as a tourist.
But what's the matter of pain, people don't see our country, don't see the differences in the country.
Don't know.
But it's just comfortable to make foreign tours falling in the midst of the rebels.
You see the world.
I don't care.
But sometimes see our house too.
What does a person know about South India
How does the West Indian man know what is on the east
Our country is full of many differentiations.
Our former president, Mr. Abdol Kalan, is a matter of concern.
Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda etc. got a new inspiration to know, understand India, fight for the country, to live.
All these great people also visited the country very widely.
Before starting this work, he tried to understand, knowing the country of India.
India has tried to live in itself.
We can try to learn, understand, live, understand the different states of our country, distinct communities, groups, their customs, their traditions, their habitual languages, food habits, their standards as a student
Besides our familiarity, there will be velu addition in the tour only if a student trys to know others.
My own experience is that I have a chance to go to more than five hundred districts in India.
I got a chance to spend at night in more than 40 districts.
On the day of this day, India is having a big responsibility today, that journey is only because of the experience of Taluko.
I get lots of facilities to understand things.
I want to feel all of our unprecedented powers, not only to say that unity in consciousness is, but this large India country.
The dream of the best India is hidden in it.
There's so much difference in our food.
Even after eating a new kind of substance every day all the differences in the rest of the world are in our food.
This is the greatest power in our country tourism.
I'm sorry, you want to go out somewhere in your holidays, get out with the purpose of understanding, understanding something without Bilderam, changes.
See India inside you.
Your life will be rich with these experiences.
Your thoughts will be huge.
Are there legends for experience
Ordinarily from October to March is very good for tourism.
People go like that.
I believe you're gonna take my propaganda further.
Leave your experiences to go to someone else.
Pick the pictures.
Definitely send your photo to the incredible instruction.
Send the pictures of humans connected to where you go.
Not only the creations, but also the natural beauty, also write about the life-threatening methods.
Please write a good business about your journey.
Please send mygow or narendraModiApp.
I got a lot of thought to encourage our tourism sector.
Listen to the seven best tourist spots in your state.
Every Indian should know that seven places in your state.
Let's go if we can.
Can you give any information about this
Can you give that information to the narendramodiApp
Can you put in the incredible instruction
Look, I'm supposed to make public literature about the seven places that have come from them, by looking at the information provided from all of them from the same state.
If you say something like that, people think that the tourist places are being spread.
Just like this, it's very good to see the seven places that you've ever seen across the country, but it's very good to see, you must send MyGov Ky, NarendramodiAp kay to the details about the places you feel like.
The Government of India must work on them.
The government accepts the information of places designed by you, designed by films, video, propaganda, encouraging them.
Come on, move with me.
To use the time from October to March, in the country's tournament, you can also become a big fond of encouragement.
I'm invited to you.
My favorite country patriot, a man has many things to me.
My mind breaks up to the confusion.
Leaves deep influence on my mind.
As much as I do, man like you.
A incident that took place in the last few days will come to your attention.
We saw the unparalleled example of women's power, country's devotion.
The Indian Army has received two heroes in the form of Lieutenant Swati, Nidhi.
They're uncommon.
Why don't you think that their husbands are not heaven while serving the Mother of India.
We can imagine how their condition is when the chronic bacteria are snatched at the young age.
But the Martyr Corner Manjeet Mahadik's wife Swati Mahadik decided to reach the Indian Army with such a tough situation.
He reached the Indian Army.
Eleven months she studied with hard work, indicating her life to shape her husband's dreams.
Like Nidhi Dubey's husband Mukhesh Dubey's been working in the army, he died.
His wife's lord also reached the army, captured.
Every Indian is natural to have the pride of this valor against our maternal power, our valor.
I'm telling these two sister-in-laws many pursuits of heart.
They provide new inspiration and new excitement to the people of the forts of the country.
Those two sister-in-laws have many respects.
My favorite patriots, Navaratri festivals, Deepavali festivals are waiting for a great opportunity for our country's youth.
FIFA Under-17 World Cup is going on in our country.
I believe the words of football all around are shouting.
Enjoying every wave of football.
In any school in India, there are no young girls playing football players in colleges.
The world's struggle to play on the frightening ground.
Come on, we all share the game in our lives.
My favorite patriot, the festival of Navaratri is going on.
The worship of Goddess Durga is going on.
The entire environment is sacred, aromatic.
On all sides there is a spiritual atmosphere, a festival environment, an atmosphere full of devotion.
All this is considered a festival of energy.
They are also called the Sarad Navaratris.
Starts the calm from now on.
During the sacred Navaratri, many purifications to all the people of the country.
Goddess is praying for our country to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the country's general survival.
I want to come to the country the ability to face all kinds of swords.
The country is fast moving forward, in 2022, to celebrate India's independence gathering, to make all the dreams of freedom fighters, 125 crores of the country's vision, immortal action, immortal efforts, sympathizership, the girls who made the journey on the road map want to bless us.
Festivals are celebrated.
Enhanced all the fun.
Thank you a lot.
