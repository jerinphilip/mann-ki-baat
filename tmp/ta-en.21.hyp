Prime Minister Mr.
In the All India Radio, the name of Narendra Mody Man Kipat (Mannth's Khural) is a coincidence of the conversation that took place in the morning.
The 28-05-2017 day of the sound, the people of the country, salvation.
This year the temperature of summer is unforgettable.
That's how we're waiting for rain.
If I'm talking to you today, the Holy Month of Ramlan has started.
In this case, the holy month of Ramlan was born, people living in India and all over the world, especially the people of the Muslim community, demonstrate my heart-breaking life.
In the month of Ramlan there is a great significance of prayer , spirit , devotion .
It is important that 125 crore people of our country are in India all the time in the world .
We must assure ourselves that these great traditions have made us our fronts.
There are also people who believe in God in this country, there are other gods, worshipers of idols, idol worshipers , such as many types of patriots are filled in our country.
The art of accompanying various kinds of ideas, various kinds of worshipping methods, various kinds of traditions has joined us with emotions.
Times, orders, principles, traditions, all of them are the only news that we can give to you - peace, compassion, goodness, yours.
This sacred Ramlan month will help us to move forward on the path of peace, peace and compassion.
I'm once again deciding my lives to everyone.
Last time, when I showed the voice of the mind, I used a word, especially for young people.
Something new, get out of the sound circle called Comfort zone, get new experiences, at this age you can live like this, fight the dangers, communicate the places.
I'm glad you're recording your backgrounds.
Personally everyone wants me to enjoy your experiences.
I can't read every thing, I can't hear the message sent by everybody, because it's coming to that level.
But on the point of view, some have played music, some are engaged in imagining new versions, some have tried to make new things by using the U tubebe, trying to learn new language, some have expressed their interest in composing arts, some in the play, some have been engaged in many kinds of attempts to deny poetry.
He's busy trying to know the nature, live, understand.
I want you to hear the feelings song in a phone call.
"I'm talking to Dhiksha Kad.
I've been able to study in the holidays in the event of almost getting away from me.
When I started studying the freedom struggle, I realized how many sacrifices and struggles were to be carried out to achieve India's freedom, how many struggles the soldiers experienced prisons.
I'm asking you to ask for a message to yourself about this matter of today's precious news about the greatest achievements of God singing in the youngest age.
I'm enjoyed that the young society shows interest in knowing about our freedom fighters, physical, material, evil sacrifices for this country.
Unbelievable men have lost their young man in prison.
Many youngsters are kissing the ropes to sleep.
We can breathe the breathing air of free India today, just as they experienced the sadness of the words.
The magicians who spent all the time in the Freedom War, wrote all the books, taught, performed great works, their writings also made greater in enjoying freedom for India.
Several years ago I went to see the cellular jail in Andaman Nicobar.
Today the Veer Savarkar's birthday.
Veer Savarkar wrote a book named Maji Janmadeh in jail .
He wrote poems in prison walls.
They kept him in a small room.
Didn't you know what freedom fighters took all of these gifts
After I learned the book written by Savarkar, I got up to see the cellular jail.
There's a singing vision, which's very exciting.
The Andaman Nicobar Ekan, known as Kalapani, was a member of all the states who sacrificed their youth in jail and spoken all the languages of India, met many miseries.
Today Veer Savarkar's birthday.
I'm telling the young people of the country that the freedom that we have received is that all the sufferings have to be experienced, so much to bear the sufferings that you've gone to the jail for a long time, you've been there after you're calling it a monster.
If you ever get the chance, definitely go, it's a kind of sacred place of freedom struggle.
My countrymen, the 5th of the month of June, the first Tuesday of the month.
Besides seeing this obsession, on the 5th day of the month of June, because in the form of World Environment Day, this year, the United Nations Connecting People of Nature, has declared it the center of connecting people with nature.
That means the journey to the originals can be called.
Well, what if connecting with nature
Based on me, we're gonna join us, we're gonna join us.
If you have a relationship with nature, creating a special land.
It can be shown to anyone better than Gandhians.
Gandhians once said: "One must care about a world one won't see, we're immaculate on the unseen world that we're not able to see the world to show him the supremacy of the world."
You might even realize that nature has my vitality.
Sometimes you've been very tired, then see how much freshness you've got on your face if you're screaming water.
Likewise, in some cases when you return home in a humid state, opening the doors and doors of the room, there will be new awareness when the clean air is deepened.
When we get our body out of the lunch flower, it comes out of the new energy when we get in contact with the Panch flower.
We've experienced all this, but it may not be able to record properly in our mind, we don't see them together.
Like this, whenever we are in touch with the natural location, then we'll have a new awareness within us.
That is why on the 5th day of the month of June, the world that connects with nature must be operational with us.
Nature has been specially protected by our fronts, some of its advantages are getting us today.
If we see the nature, the chances made by us will benefit from it.
Earth and climate are showing the basic emotions of energy .
It's well described in our sentiments.
The entire guidance of environment gives us a kind of obsession, which is fifteen thousand years old script.
Our country is a matter of land.
It has been said that the sacredness of ours is only due to the earth.
Earth is our mother, we're dead of her.
When you talk about Lord Buddha, it's a matter of shine.
The birth of Mahana Buddha, his knowledge, his Maha-Parri Niwaan, was born under the tree.
A natural lifestyle is located in our country as many festivals , many worship methods , non-migrants , city dwellers , village dwellers , tribal society , natural worship , nature love .
Yet, we need to understand it in contemporary words, with modern ideas.
There are colors that have come to me from the States.
In almost all the states a big campaign of trees starts just after rains .
Hundreds of trees are walking.
School children are also involved in it, social services are involved in it, their own throne agencies are involved, the government takes the lead in its own level.
We should also give more importance and share in the work of trees during this rainy season.
My folk folks, the 21st of June is the day of the world's well-cognizable identity.
Everyone celebrated this as the day of World Yoga .
On the 21st day of June very short period world yogic day is spread around the world , which connects the world to people .
Once the world's disciplinary powers show your worst face, the world's greatest sympathizer.
We can combine the world through yoga art.
Yoga is the way the body, the mind, the intelligence, the soul, the same way the world can be connected with the yoga.
Today due to lifestyle, due to immunity, due to increasing responsibilities, pressure, life has become great.
We're seeing this situation happening even at the young age.
During the period of spending days with narrow medicines , stress will be our symptoms to live a stinking life .
The sympathetic yoga that gives sympathy to both health and sex.
Yoga is not just exercise .
It is possible only by yoga that we should experience the journey that is healthy with body, mind, thought, habits and habits.
Two days ago, the papers were written to all the governments, all the leaders of the world before the yoga art.
Last year, I've announced some competitions related to yoga, some gifts.
Gradually, works are coming forward in this direction.
I've been advised to demonstrate life for this basic advice.
It's very comfortable.
The third international yogic art of coming tomorrow has been told to ask me that the three heads of the family will join together to exercise yoga .
Daddy Pati, Mother Dad, son-in-law, together with three pairs of maids, performing yoga, and offering smoking.
Normally, it's going to be a fascinating combination today, a new ritual for yoga.
I appreciate my pleasures to the adviser, however we set up the operation of Celfi with our daughter, which is a comfortable experience, just like composing three headlines of yoga, which makes the folk and the world interest, enjoyment.
You must send me three guys at the NarendramodiApple, in MyGov, everywhere you're supposed to play together.
Next time, today, it's going to be a day's picture.
It'll give rise to light future.
I'll invite you all.
In the event of three weeks of international yoga days, start the training from here.
On the 1st day of June, I've been watching something related to yoga everyday in Dudeer, which will continue till the 21st of June.
I'm afraid you're sending.
And you're also talking about yoga related matters, spreading, combining people.
Somehow it's a health care campaign to survive.
I'll invite you all in this.
Have you given me the responsibility of providing me the principal service
Have I got the first chance to talk to you on the 15th day of August after leaving the Red Fort of New Delhi
So I talked about sacredness.
Starting on the day I've been touring different parts of India.
Where's the motor going
What did the rod do
I'm very glad to pay attention to some people.
A pleasant phone call came to me, in which I didn't think about the thing said.
But I thank you for making such an opposite eyeball to me.
I hope this phone call will make you like that.
"Hey, they are, I'm talking to Naina from Mumbai.
I've always seen in social museums and TVs that the motivations you're going everywhere, the people there are paying more attention to all the sanitation.
Mumbai, and Surat, the devious people of your calls are driven by social, sanitation.
Old people are aware of pure awareness between children.
I've seen how many times they're gonna be ruined in the streets.
In the valleys of Kashi, after you started purifying yourself, it became a fascination.
"You're right, I'm gonna go anywhere, the government machines all over there are cleaning, but now it's always purifying even in the society.
5 days, 7 days, 10 days before I'm going, the work of cleaning the quantity.
Communications are also of great importance to this.
A few days ago I went to the Ghatch region of Gujarat .
The sanctuary was carried out in the largest quantity.
I didn't see it connected, but only after this phone call came to me, yeah fucked me that this thing was right.
How enjoyed when the country realizes how it looks so special, sweet
That's greater pleasure than this, that's cleaning my journey.
In order to welcome the Prime Minister, the other products of Musthibs are comfortable, but the importance of sanitation is unique.
It's just a joy of anyone who loves cleanliness, that's preferable.
I'm supposed to demonstrate my lucky lives to everyone who is responsible for satisfaction.
Someone has brought me a suggestion.
It's a very funny advice in the meantime.
I can't say it couldn't be fulfilled.
Crazy, they're the ones who call you your program, if you want to call me, how's the sanitation
How many tons of skulls do you give me
That's the basis that I'm gonna tell you that I can confirm my journey.
The idea is good but I have to think about it.
It's important that I'll get rid of all these dancing bullshits, than to give things check up what's right to create a run.
Sorry, how many people don't get sick, we can save.
Think, how many human activity it will be.
I'm sure a thing I'm telling you, we don't want to see it as a treasure as it's a base, it's a base.
Once we're supposed to go to the pool, many new methods related reservoirs will begin to emerge before us.
Young people associated in Startup also come forward with new plans.
Press new instruments.
With the help of the city representatives of the State Governments of India, it has been decided to conduct a major important campaign related to reservoirs.
On the 5th day of the month of June , on the day of global climate , only 4,000 cities of the country there are essential substances to gather diabetes , liquidity etc .
There are two types of potatoes, one in green, second in blue.
Two types of toilet materials are extracted - one liquid excavation , the other is dry .
We have to follow the compliance, in 4,000 cities, these skulls are kept.
Put the dry dress on the blue thigh, put the fluids in the green hut.
In vegetables such as salads , vegetables , nutritious food , eggs , leaves of trees , etc . should be put in the hut of green huts .
They're all busy in the fields.
If we remember the greenery of the wilderness, we'll remember what to put in the green huts.
The second type of potatoes includes paper potatoes , wooden pieces , glass pieces , clothes , plastics , polythenes , broken papaws , robber items , metals .
They're resurrected in machines again.
Whenever you don't have any use, put them in the blue hut.
I believe we'll make such a good habit.
We have to take a new step every time towards satisfaction.
That's why we can fulfill the dream about the sanitation of Gandhians.
Today, I'm supposed to describe a thing that if only one man has a strong bloom in his mind, it's how many big people can transform.
That's how cleaning work was done.
Some days ago a thing fell into the ear.
Versova beach considered as a narrow beach in Mumbai has become a clean , beautiful beach today .
It didn't happen suddenly.
For just 80-90 weeks, the citizens have been trying to change the Versova beach completely.
After disappearing in thousands of pools , the Versova beach has become clean and charming .
And the responsibility of this, the Versova City accepted its own.
A good man named Afrosh Shah had fully enjoyed himself in it before October 2015.
Gradually it grew up and became a people's movement.
For this work, Afros Shah gave him the United Nations Environment Plan-UNEP, the biggest award.
This is the first Indian who gets the Earth of Champions.
I'm supposed to appreciate my life for Afros Shah and this operation.
Look how he's connecting everyone in his area, changing people
It's an excellent example of prediction for everyone.
Brothers, today I want to share the more happy thing with you.
It is said that the area of ' Reasi block ' adjoining Jammu and Kashmir regarding ' pure India movement ' has completely disappeared from the habit of excreting .
I'm deciding my lives to all the citizens belonging to the Reasi block area, all the administrations on that part, they're good examples.
I've been told that those who have guided this operation are the women of that area, who have been aware of them, who have carried out accidental gatherings.
Going home, streets, they enjoyed the people.
I'm supposed to demonstrate my heart-breaking deeds to those mothers and sisters, where the administrations are determining my lives, they've made good beginnings.
My favourite folks, past 15 days, months, continuous news, TV channels, social publications, three years of activity of the movement, discussions and complications are going on.
Three years ago you gave me the responsibility of the main servant.
A number of researches have been displayed, there have been convincing symptoms.
I see them all very healthy symptoms.
It's been seen in every conversation last 3 years.
People from all the levels of society have also studied this .
It's an important function in public opinion.
My clear, genius, people of Macassar, must surrender the qualifications of the comprehensive work.
Expending time, listening deeply to our work, suggesting, supporting, showing deficiencies, I'm trying to see my thanks, I'm making these things very important.
I'm supposed to thank those who gave important backgrounds to blackmail.
Whatever crimes do you have, it's possible to facilitate when they appear.
Procedures may be good, may be afraid of less benefits, may be bad, however, should be learned from them, through which only progress can be seen.
Magnificent philosophy accumulates the democratic system.
This is also one of the most important research in the academic country, a conservative country.
My folk folks, we're just a simple dweller like yours, as bad as good as a common drunken, like any simple drunken dweller, affect me.
Some people talk about the monkey ' s voice , some imagine it in political sight .
But I don't even think of it when it starts, I'm feeling after a long experience that the program called "Mannthin Khurl" will change me to every family member of India.
In the middle of a family, sitting in the house, telling me about home matters.
Lovely families are dealing with these things with me.
As a simple man, I'm afraid of the effect of my mind.
Two days ago, in the Presidential Palace, the President of Methaku, the President of the Republic, the President of Methaku, the President of the Consulate of Methaku, all joined the sympathy of the "Mannthin Hoover" program.
In a way of a person, in the form of a simple drunken, this possibility made me more excited.
I betrayed the President of the President, the President of the United States, the Leader of the Conflict, all those who are in high ranks, excluding your golden time, giving importance to the monkey.
In a way Mandhan's voice has given me a new ritual.
Some of our friends, when Mandin's voice was engaged in work on the book, talked to me sometimes.
When I came to know about a matter related to it sometimes, I was surprising.
A artist named Akbar Sahab lives in Abu Tapi .
Akbar Sahab preferred a sympathy : "Whatever things were discussed in the monkey of Man, the sympathetic form of which he would like to be prepared by his art, he would not even have received one rupee.
Akbar Sahab gave a art form to the monkey of his love.
I'm gonna cross Akbar Sahabu.
My poor folk folks, next time we meet all the places of the country, the weather will change, the conclusions of the tests will come, and the study will begin again.
When rain comes, the new pleasant environment, the new smell, the new soil.
Come on, let's go ahead with nature in this environment, connected with us.
Live my strength for all of you.
Thank you.
