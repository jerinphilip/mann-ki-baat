The matter of mind, May 2015, my dear countrymen, when I talked to you last time, the horrific incident of the earthquake had made me very disturbed.
The mind did not want to talk, yet talked about the mind.
Today, when I am talking about my mind, there are terrible hot winds, heat and problems around him.
I pray to you all that we should take care of ourselves at this heat, everybody will have to say that drink a lot of water, cover the body. But I tell you, we need animals and birds next to you.
This is an opportunity to give children a job in the family that they keep water to drink birds in a utensil outside the house, and also see that they do not become hot.
You will be a good ritual of children in the family to see.
And animals and birds will also be protected in this fierce heat.
This season is also of heat on one side, so happiness is somewhere of gum.
After exams, until the results come, the mind does not sit quietly.
Now students who pass CBSE, different board exams and other exams have got their results.
I congratulate them all.
Very congratulations.
The meaning of my mind came to me from the fact that when many students gave this information to me, after the results came that whatever was heard in your mind before exam, I fully followed it at the time of exam and I got the benefit from it.
Well, guys, I like you wrote this to me.
But the reason for your success is not my mind. The reason for your success has worked hard throughout the year, the whole family has joined you and shared this hard work.
Your school, your teacher, everyone has tried.
But you have shielded yourself according to everyone's expectations.
Talking about the mind, the tip that is available at the time of going to the exam was not of the type.
But enjoyment came to me that yes, how much is the use of mind today, how meaningful it is.
I'm happy.
When I'm saying somewhere gum, pleasure, there are many friends who have passed by very good marks.
Some of my young friends must have passed, but Marx may have come down.
And there will be some who have failed.
For those who have passed, I have so much suggestion that you are at the turn from where you are choosing your career.
Now you have to decide which way ahead will be.
And he will also depend on what kind of desire you choose.
Usually most students do not even know what to read, why to read, what is the goal.
Most things happen in their surroundings, there are decisions around friends, families, friends, or parents who have desires.
Now the world has become very big.
There are no limitations of subjects, there are no limitations of opportunities.
You dare to choose the path according to your interest, nature, trend.
Why do you drag yourself on the prevailing routes
Try.
And you know and know why you do not choose the field of such studies that you have the best things inside you
But should you ever think that whatever I will be, whatever I will learn, what will happen to my country to work in it
There are many places like this, you will be surprised, in comparison to the museums built in the world, the museums in India are very low.
And sometimes it becomes very difficult to find eligible persons for this museum.
Because traditionally there is not a very popular area.
Well, I don't want anybody to pull you on one thing.
But, it means that if the country needs the best teachers, then the best soldiers are also needed, the best scientists need the best artists and musicians too.
How big is the area of sports, and except for the players, how excellent human resources are required for the game jumping world.
That is, there are so many areas, there is a world full of such diversity.
We must try, dare.
Your power, your strength, your dreams should also be matched with the dreams of the country.
This is the occasion to choose your way.
From those who have failed, I will say that success failure in life is natural.
The failure that considers failure to be an opportunity also laid the foundation stone of success.
The failure that makes itself fail, it never succeeds in life.
We can learn a lot from failure too.
And sometimes why do not we believe that today's failure can also be an opportunity to recognize you, can you have an opportunity to know your powers
And you may know your powers and choose a new path by knowing your energy.
I remember the former President of our country, Mr. APJ Abdul Kalam ji.
He wrote a book of his life in his book Mai Journey Transforming Dreams Into Action.
He said that I had a desire to become a pilot, had a lot of dream, I would become a pilot.
But when I went to become a pilot, I failed, I was neglected.
Now you see, their neglect, their failure also became a big opportunity.
He became the great scientist of the country.
Become President.
And he contributed a lot to the molecular power of the country.
And so I say friends, don't suppress the burden of failure.
Failure is also an opportunity.
Do not let such failure go.
Keep the failure too.
Search.
There is also an opportunity of hope between failure.
And I urge them to request my young friends, and especially their family members, that if the son fails, do not make the atmosphere so that they lose all hopes in life.
Sometimes the failure of the child is linked to the dreams of parents and there is a crisis in it.
This should not happen.
Even the ability to digest failure gives life to life.
I once again wish all my successful young friends.
And failed friends have got an opportunity to find an opportunity, so I also wish it well.
Efforts to awaken trust, move forward.
The talk of the last mind and today when I am talking about you, there have been a lot of things in the meantime.
There was a year of my government, the whole country analyzed it closely, criticized and many people gave us the district marks too.
By the way, this churning is very important in democracy, the side-opposite is essential.
It is very important to know what is the deficiencies.
What is good, it also has its own benefit.
But for me, more than two things in the last month enjoy my mind.
There is always a stir in my heart to do something for the poor in our country.
I think new things, I accept it if the suggestion comes.
We launched last month Prime Minister's Security Insurance Scheme, Prime Minister Jyoti Bima Yojana, Atal Pension Scheme - Three schemes of Social Security.
Those plans have not yet been twenty days, but today I say with pride. Hardly in our country, by relying on the government's plans, depending on the government's plans, such a large amount of common human beings should join him. I am happy to say that only eight crore in a short time of twenty days, more than one million people have made their nominations in these schemes, became part of the schemes.
This is our very important step towards social security.
And it is going to get a lot of benefit in the coming days.
I urge those who have not reached this point so far that you take advantage.
Can someone think, a rupee of a month, only twelve rupees for twelve months, and you get a security insurance plan.
Life Jyoti Bima Yojana - less than one rupee of the daily, i.e. three hundred thirty rupees of the year.
I say that poor people do not have to depend on others.
Poor self-powered.
In that direction we're taking one step after another.
And I want to make such an army, and I want to choose the army from the poor.
And this army of my poor people will fight against poverty, defeat poverty.
And for many years in our country, this burden is on our head, we will continue to make continuous efforts to get rid of that poverty and will be successful.
Another important thing that I am enjoying is Kisan TV Channel.
Although there is a lot of TV channels in the country, what is not there, cartoon channels also run, sports channels run, news runs, entertainment runs.
A lot walks.
But the farmer's channel is important for me because I can see the future very well.
In my view, the Kisan Channel is an open university with a farm.
And there is a channel whose student is also a farmer, and whose teacher is also a farmer.
Learning from the best experiences, moving forward from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture, pieces of small land remaining.
The family grew up, the part of the land became small, and then how the productivity of our land increased, how to bring changes in the crop - learning these things is necessary.
Now the weather can also be known earlier.
With all these things, these TV channels are going to work and my farmer brothers and sisters have arranged for farmer monitoring in every district.
You must contact him.
I would also like to say to my fishermen siblings, people involved in fishing, there is a lot for them in this farmer channel, animal husbandry is the traditional work of rural life of India and there is a kind of helpful area in agriculture, but if the world counts, then the number of milk production in the world is far behind, India is far behind.
As much as milk production should be compared to the number of animals, the same is not in our country.
How to produce more milk per animal, how to take care of animals, how to rear, what to eat, what to do, traditionally, we do a lot, but it is very important to go ahead with scientific methods and by going, animal husbandry can also financially strengthen us, strengthen the farmer, can strengthen the animal husband.
How do we move forward in this area, how we succeed, you get scientific guidance in that direction.
My dear countrymen
Remember June 21
Well, in this land, on June 21, it is remembered that this is the longest day.
But June 21 has now become a new identity for the world.
While addressing the United Nations in the last September, I had placed a topic and proposed that on June 21, it should be celebrated as International Yoga Day.
And the whole world has become surprised, you will also be surprised, within 100 days this proposal was passed with the support of one hundred continuous nations, such proposals were found in the history of United Nations. The proposal was passed in the shortest time, and all the lands of the world were included in it, for any Indian, this is a very glorious event.
But now the responsibility is ours.
Did we ever think that yoga could become a medium of connecting the world too
In the imagination of our ancestors of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, Yoga is becoming the medium of connecting the world as a catalitic agent.
How prideful is, it's a matter of happiness.
But its strength will be made when we all present the right form of yoga in a very large quantity, the right power of yoga, in front of the world.
Yoga connects heart and mind, yoga is also a medium of disease free, yoga is also a medium of liberation and now I am seeing, yoga body works to add mind to the mind, further connecting the world Can do it.
Why don ' t we become its ambassador
Why do we not provide comfort to this important education, which is going to work for this human welfare
Yoga Day should be celebrated on June 21 in every corner of India.
Your relatives live in any part of the world, your friends live somewhere, you also telephone them and tell them that they also celebrate Yoga Day by collecting people there.
If they do not have any knowledge of yoga then take a book, but read and explain to everyone what is yoga.
Read a letter, but I believe that we have really done Yoga Day as an important step for world welfare, human group passing through the welfare of mankind and life of stress, desperate disappointment among difficulties, man is in the ability to give new consciousness, energy.
I would like that the world which has accepted, which has been honored by the world, which India has given to the world, this yoga should be a matter of pride for all of us.
There are three weeks left now, you must try, definitely join and join others, I will urge them.
I would like to say one thing and especially to the soldiers of my army, who are engaged in the security of the country today and who are living their lives by retirement from the army today, the soldiers who sacrifice sacrifice for the country, and I am not doing this as a Prime Minister.
I want to talk to the soldiers of my country today, with the truth of the heart, depth of my mind.
One-rank, forest-pension, are not the truth that the question has been entangled for forty years
Is it not the truth that all the previous governments talked about it, did nothing
I assure you.
I have promised among the retired army personnel that my government will implement forest-rank, forest pension.
We do not withdraw from responsibility and after the formation of the government, different departments are also working on this.
As much as I believed, there are no simple topics, complicated, and forty years the problems have been added to it.
I have been engaged in simplifying it, in order to make it simplified, to find ways to everyone sitting in the government.
It is not necessary to give the news of moments in the media.
It does not have any running commentary.
I assure you this government, I repeat - This government will be your forest-rank, forest-pension issue, bring solution - and the ideology in which we have come, The ideals we have to move forward. The importance of your life is very much.
It is not just a government program or a political program to worry about joining your life for me, it is the disclosure of my patriotism.
I will once again urge all the army personnel of my country to play games with you for forty years.
I don't want that route, nor do I want to take any steps that make problems complicated.
You trust me, those who have to talk, have to dispute, have to do their politics, they are happy.
What I can do for those who die for the country - this is my intention, and I believe that the matter of my mind in which there is nothing but truth, will reach your hearts.
Forty years you have patience - give me some time, give me an opportunity to work, and we will solve the problems of sitting.
This is once again I trust the countrymen.
In the days of holidays, all the people have gone somewhere.
Have gone to different corners of India.
Some people may have planned to go now.
Naturally, "Seeing is Billiving - When we visit, we go to the relatives' house, somewhere they reach the place of tourism."
The world gets a different opportunity to understand, see.
Who has seen the pond of his village, and for the first time when he sees the sea, he does not know how the feelings of the mind are, he can not only describe that his village can not tell how big the sea is.
View has a different feeling.
You must have gone somewhere with your man friends, or go to the family in the days of the holidays.
I do not know if you go to tour, then there is no habit of writing the diary.
Write, experiences should be written, meet new people, then listen to their words, should write the description of things that have seen, in a way, inclusion it within itself.
It should not be done to go ahead with such a glance.
Because this tour is a education in itself.
Everyone does not get the opportunity to go to the Himalayas, but those who have visited the Himalayas and have written books read them, then they will know if they have described the pleasant journeys.
I don ' t say you ' re a writer
But if we are not traveling, we try to learn something from it, try to understand this country, try to know the country, understand its diversity.
The mines there are dresses, dresses, colloquials, customs, their dreams, their aspirations, their difficulties, it is such a huge country, knowing the whole country - a genocide is reduced, you must have gone somewhere, but I have a wish, this time you will have gone in the journey or going.
Can you share your experience with me
I really will enjoy.
I urge you to send incredible India Hash Tag, with this, send me your photo, your experience and some of the things I like will share with others.
If you see your experiences right, I also feel, I see what you have seen, I sit away and see it.
The way you can walk alone by going to the beach, I can not do it right now, but I will like to know your experience and share your best experiences, I will share with everyone.
Well, once again I remind you of the heat, I would like you to handle yourself, do not be sick, there are ways to save yourself from heat, but also take care of those animal birds.
This is the matter of mind today, I went to speak in such an idea that came in.
I'll meet again next time, then I will talk, thank you very much, very much.
