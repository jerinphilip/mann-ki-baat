My favorite patriots, greeting all of you, the Bengal Translation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Man Ki Vaat' (Twenty Festivals) program
This is the twin festival of 'Man Ka Vaat'.
And it's over a year to see this.
Last year, October 3 was lucky to talk to me about "Man Ki Wat".
One year of 'Man Ki Walt' is complete.
I don't know what you've got, but I'm sure I've got a lot.
There's a lot of genocide in democracy.
I have an original concern in my life and that's why I believe in people's strength.
I can tell you what the vaat has taught me, what I know, what I feel, what we think, the power of the people is much more than that.
Our ancestors told us about democracy, they said they were part of God.
I can tell you what I feel from 'Man What Walt' that our predecessors have a very big power to think, because I felt it.
I've been asking everyone for "Man Ki Walt", but I've always tried to see or understand two suggestions.
But a million people are actively advising me.
It's yourself a funny power.
Or you're telling the Prime Minister, writing in this site, sending letters, but I'm not getting a chance to see them.
Anyone who could be desperate, but I don't think.
Yeah, this letter has given me a greater education.
I can know about the government's very minute discomfort, and I also congratulate all these suggestions that they do not mean only pieces of paper, have respected the people's aspirations.
They organized this, calling the officials of various departments in the airplane, all these demands of common people have been judged in front of them, and it has been seen that some of these policy matters have become uncomfortable for any particular person, which has removed the government's attention from
A lot of news from Grassroot Level is coming to the government.
And the government is a fundamental decision that the news will come upstairs from the bottom, and the path will be shown below.
Someone thought that the source of this news would be turned into a 'Man What Wat'.
But it's really possible.
And that's how "Man What Vata" has become a medium of expressing its own thoughts.
I once spoke about the matter with Selfy, Daughter.
And so the whole world was surprised to hear.
But the picture of Daughter has come from all over the world with Lakshmi Selfy and the descendants are proud of it.
And when they took a daughter with selfy, they didn't only proud of their daughter-in-laws, they raised a vision within themselves.
And when the others see the selfies, each of them felt that they had to sacrifice despair for the daughter-in-law.
It's a silent revolution.
This is how I talked about incredible india, keeping in mind the point of tourism of India.
I said whenever you're going to travel somewhere, you're gonna take a good picture and send me, I'll see.
It's not a surprising consequence.
From every corner of India, people have sent such pictures.
The state government or the tourism department of the central government could not even think that our country has such an invaluable wealth.
It's possible to bring everyone to a certain stage that the government doesn't cost a single penny.
People have enhanced the government.
Prior to October last year, I requested people to mention Gandhi Jayanti that, on October 2, when we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday, we should keep in mind the 'Khadi For Nation'.
And isn't it the time claim that we would think of buying Khadi's things in the mind of Khadi Fornation.
It's a little bit like we didn't have dry things.
Today, I can say with great pleasure that Khadi's sale has been almost doubled in the last one year.
And it wasn't for government advertisements.
It didn't cost millions of rupees.
It was a belief of the people, a feeling.
Once I told 'Man What Wat' that the poor were burnt in the house, their smoke brought water to the eyes of the children, did the poor mother have no right to get gas cylinders
I requested the financially prosperous people to expel the ghosts you have for gas cylinders.
Think about you.
And today I can say with joy that almost thirty million families of the country left the fate of gas cylinders.
They're not bigger.
I saw in a TV channel, a widow, a retired teacher, standing on the line of expedition of gas cylinder.
The middle-class, the lower-central families of the society, which are very inconvenient to leave the furnace, they too have abandoned the convenience.
Isn't this a real revolution
Isn't it the power of the people
The government will also have to take this lesson that there is an individual power outside our government procedure, which has a lot of capacity, enthusiasm and imagination.
As much as the government works with the people, it can work as a good confrontation for the development of society.
I had faith in all the things I trusted in 'Man What Walt'.
And that's why I want to congratulate people's power through "Man What Walt" today.
The people of my country have been trying to absorb ourselves in the welfare of the country with the importance of every small story.
What else can be greater than this
On this festival of 'Man Ki Walt', I've been thinking of taking a new effort.
I prayed to the people to tell you your questions, your advice through television.
I'm gonna talk about those things in the "Man What Walt".
I enjoy that more than 50,000 phones have come from different parts of the country.
Siachen, Kachh or Kamrup or Kanyakumari from Kashmir - There is no place in India from where the people did not call.
It's my own goodness.
People of all ages called.
I heard some phones myself and I like it.
My government officials are working with the rest of the phones.
You might have taken a couple minutes to call, but I'm very important to call you this short-time call.
My entire government will work according to your advice.
I am very surprised and enjoyed.
When there's Negativity or negative attitude around, my feelings say something else.
These five thousand people have spoken like their own.
Whatever they could say, because there was no obstacle about this.
But I am surprised, they have the effect of 'Man What Wat'.
They've given a very positive suggestion.
Look at the work, the ordinary people of the country take a positive attitude.
This is a big treasure for the country.
Maybe there was a serious complaint on a phone of two percent.
Otherwise, ninety percent of the phones were exciting and enjoying.
And one thing has come to us, especially a capable person, especially a lot of phones from the blind people.
One reason for this could be because they don't have the luck to watch TV, so they must listen to the radio.
From this I realized how important the radio is to the blind people.
I've got a new direction from this phone.
These phones are very important to make the government more sensitive.
Pawan Acharya gave me a suggestion from Alwar in Rajasthan.
I think everyone should listen to it and the people of the country should accept it.
Surely listen to what he wants to say: "My name is Pawan Acharya, I'm in the Alwar of Rajasthan.
My statement to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is that now you request the people of all over the country, in Deepavali they use soil lamps.
Thousands of kumor brothers will be beneficial as the environment is beneficial.
Thank you.
"Pavan, I believe your advice will spread in the corner of India on the wind speed.
He gave a very good advice.
The soil itself is invaluable and so the soil is invaluable.
It has a price from the environment.
The lamp is built in the poor house.
The poor man drives his world to do this.
And I want to tell the countrymen that if we follow the advice of Pavana Acharya in the Incomplete Deepavali festival, then the light will burn in our house, and its light will spread in a poor man's house.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chatti, I had a chance to spend two-three hours with the soldiers.
I've spent time with the water, the place and the airways, the place and the air force - Army, Air Force and Navy.
On the 50 years of the war with Pakistan in 1965, a 'Shuranjali' exhibition was organized near the Indian Gate in Delhi.
I was showing this exhibition with great enthusiasm.
I went for half an hour, but when I saw the exhibition, it was half an hour ago.
What wasn't there - the whole history was taken alive.
I'm supposed to look at the beauty.
From the point of view of history, I'll say it's very educatorial, and to enjoy life, I'll say that there can be no more inspiration than this to serve the motherland.
We can observe this exhibition that we have heard of all the incredible courage and sacrifices of our army.
Because we didn't get any pictures, videographs weren't possible.
Haji Pier's fight or the war on the north side of the country, the battle of Chaminda or Haji Pier Pass Jay, whatever you don't see, there is a thrilling feeling and we are proud of our army.
I have met with all these brave soldiers, even with all those families, whom relatives sacrificed their lives in this war.
The survivors who participated in this war have come to their last festival today.
All of them came to this exhibition, and when I had a chance to compete with them, I thought it was their infinite life.
It inspired me.
If you want to create history, then know the finest things of history, understand.
History by creating a combination with our own roots.
If the relationship with history goes shut, the possibility of creating a new history is also destroyed.
Through such a valorous exhibition, we can experience history, know history and live the seeds of inspiration to create infinite history.
This exhibition will last for a while.
My request, you're around Delhi, you must see this exhibition with your family and don't hurry like me.
Slowly look healthy.
I'm back in two and a half hours, you must take three hours.
You must see.
Look at the power of democracy, a little boy is commanding the Prime Minister, but the little boy has forgotten to call his name quickly.
I don't know his name, but he's the prime minister's privilege, and all our patriots are imaginary.
Listen to what this little boy is saying to us - Principal Minister Modiji, I want to tell you that you have started the Swachh Bharat campaign, arrange a Dustbin in all the streets.
"This boy is right.
We should make hygiene healthy and take appropriate arrangements for it.
I'm very happy to hear about this boy.
The joy is that I announce the launch of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on October 2, and I can say that after Independence, there is a discussion of hours after this first parliament.
We're discussing our government's work.
I have to hear a lot, that Modiji speaks very big about cleanliness, but what's going on till the end
I don't feel bad about it.
In this, I look good. The Parliament of the country is now discussing India's cleanliness.
On the other hand, Parliament on one side and on one side the children of the country are talking about cleanliness.
What else can be the greatest luck of this country
With the cleanliness of the movement that has been created, the awareness of the environment that has been created to hate the immersion, will make this government compulsory to work for the creation of a clean India.
Local self-religional institutions - it is Panchayat, Nagar Panchayat, Pur Nigam, Mahanagar Purana Nigam or State or Centre - Every organization has to work on this matter.
We have to take this movement in the midst of trouble.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the 2019th anniversary, we will go on the right path to succeed Mahatma Gandhi's dream.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi says
Mahatma Gandhi once said, freedom and cleanliness - If I have to like one of these two, then I will first like cleanliness, after independence.
Cleanliness was more important to Gandhiji than independence.
Come, everyone follows Mahatma Gandhi and we take some steps to fulfill his wishes.
Gulshan Aurora of Delhi sent a message to Mygov.in portal.
He wanted to know about Dindayalji's birthday.
My dear patriots, the life of great men is the source of our inspiration.
And our work is to follow great men's jurisdiction, not to valuate it.
They live for the country, they're the source of our inspiration.
And today there are occasions to remind many great men - on 25th September Pandit Dindayal, on October 2, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, 11th October, Jayprakash Narayan and 31th October, the birth anniversary of Sir Vallabhbhai Pattal - We can recall many such names because our country is dedicated to many gems.
Any day there's historically accumulated with the name of a great man.
In the next days, we will remember all these great men, we will reach every house of their lives, and try to teach something from it.
I will specifically mention October 2, that day, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, I told you last year, you have different fashion clothes, different types of frictions, there are many other things, but Khadi should be a special place.
I'm asking for a second time that two months from October to one month of Khadi dress is specifically released.
Congratulate this opportunity.
With Khadi, we need to give equal importance to the artist.
Our fiancs work so hard, if we buy 5 rupees, 10 rupees or 50 rupees of any wild artist or khadi, then the last time the money will reach the poor Tantubai's house - A poor man who prepares the khadi will reach the house on the afternoon.
And that's why in this Deepawali we must give us a place in our house, we'll wear clothing.
I don't mean to say that you're gonna finish clothing, I mean, use some furniture materials.
And look, last time the daggers were sold twice.
How many poor people have benefited.
The work that the government can't spend through a few lakhs of advertisements has been possible with your little help.
That's "Jan Shakti".
And that's why I'm requesting you to do this again.
Dear countrymen, one thing has enjoyed me.
My wish is, you're also a joy.
I went to Kolkata in May.
Some of Subhas Chandra Bose's family came to meet me.
His brother-in-law Chandra Bose arranged everything.
There was a chance to spend a little while with the people of Subashbabu's family.
That day it was fixed that the people of Subashbabu's family would come to the Prime Minister's residence.
Chandra Bose and his family are looking after this.
And last week, I know that more than fifty members of Subashbabu's family will come to the Prime Minister's residence.
You can imagine how pleasant this thing is for me.
Maybe they're all coming to the Prime Minister's residence this first time.
But the most happy thing for me is that the Prime Minister didn't have the chance to make such a guest, that I would get the chance in October.
More than 50 members of Subashbabu's family, who live in different countries, are all coming.
It's very pleasant to me.
I'm interested in greeting them, feeling very happy.
Bhargvi sent me a message.
I think he's going to be a leader or a leader.
He said, "My name is Bhargvi Kande.
I want the Prime Minister to request you to warn the youth to register the vote.
This will increase the participation of young people in the next day and in future, the young people can make important contributions to the formation and conduct of government.
Thank you.
"Naming the name in the vote list and voting in the context of Bhargavi.
You're right.
The fate of every vote in democracy.
And this awareness is growing slowly.
Hundreds of votes are increasing.
And I'm so kind of thankful to the Election Commission of India.
A few years ago, we saw that the selection commission conducted the selection process only.
But there's been a big change in the last few years.
Today, our selection commission is not just a selection director, working as a helper, a voter-friendly, and all their thoughts, all the plans, the voter.
It's a very good change.
But only the selection commission will work, it won't work.
We have to create awareness in schools, colleges, schools.
It won't be conscious at the time of the election.
We have to pay attention to the voting list in time.
I have the valuable right, whether the right is safe, or whether I use it properly - we have to keep an eye on that side.
I hope the newborns of the country don't record their names in the vote, they must record it and definitely vote.
I open the day of the election, "Botan in the first time, then drink".
It must be a holy duty, everyone.
Yesterday Parshu, I've been visiting Kashi.
I've met many people, there have been many events, many met, but I'd like to tell you about two boys.
In a boy-witness Pand, who is a student of the seventh-step of the Central School of Banaras Hindu University, a very self-confidence.
But at such a young age, his interest in physics has surprised me.
I think he's studying a lot, surfing the Internet, observing the new use of science.
How to get rid of the rail accident, what kind of technology is needed, how to reduce the cost of energy, how the feeling of robots comes, etc. was talking about.
Truly a wonderful boy.
I couldn't judge his speech.
But his self-confidence, his interest and I want our country's students to be attracted to science.
They need to ask questions. What, why, when.
It must be simple to ask.
That's what a Sonampatel met with a little sand.
Sonam is not a year.
The daughter of the beautiful resident of Banaras, Sadabritta Patel, a very poor family girl.
I am surprised, the voice of the whole Geetha girl.
But the most important thing is, when I asked him, he was insisting on English as Shlok, explaining the shloka, listening to Hindi.
I told her to ask her father, she's been doing this since the age of five.
Where did he learn to ask, his father said, he didn't even know.
I asked about his studies, didn't he read Geetha
Gentlemen said, "No, Sonam, once the eggs begin to finish all in the evening, and if history falls, it's in the dark."
They're astonished about the girl, that's the only one in the family.
I'm really curious.
Sometimes there's a love for celebrity in children.
There was nothing between Sonam.
I think God has given him some special power.
It was important to meet these two kids on my Kashi journey, so I think I'm telling you about them.
Whatever you see on TV, we do more than what we read in the newspaper, sometimes get enjoyed in such a way, my word with these two boys and girls will be remembered.
I saw, some people are coming for me in the 'Man Ki Walt' program, see what Hariyana's sandeep is saying: Sandeep from the territory, sir, I want you to celebrate the festival once in a month.
Because we get a lot of inspiration from you.
"Sandeepiji, what else can you do with me
Once in a month, I have to make a lot of effort to get out of time.
Sometimes we have to wait for me for an hour, half-a-half of our friends in the sky.
But I respect this idea of yours.
Let's thank you for your proposal, it's okay once.
One year of the 'Man Ki Walt' ceremony was completed.
Do you know how much good you used to do with the specific radio
He started broadcasting his radio from Germany, and repeatedly told the people of India about the freedom movement through radio.
He introduced Ajad Hind Radio with weekly news bulletin.
This radio was broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengal, Marti, Punjabi, Pustu, Urdu Pole.
I really talked about your mind for you for a year to celebrate "Man Ki Walt" in the sky.
Listen to you, think about you, consider your proposals, and from that my thoughts open to you, which reaches you through the sky.
I say, but it's really yours, and it's my satisfaction.
In the next month, the 'Man Ki Walt' will be repeated, send your proposals, the government will also benefit from the proposals.
Resolution begins.
Your participation is valuable for me, all of you are very happy, thank you
.
