On the 26th of the month of March 2017 in Akashwani, the Prime Minister, "Man Ki Bath", will be my country's favourite, all of you.
Most of the families around the country are busy with their children's examinations.
In the families of those who have been tested, there is a comfortable environment in the families of tests.
At such a time, let's say once again, listen to what I said to the students in the word 'Mansu'.
You'll get a lot of work while testing.
It's 26 March.
Today is the Freedom Day celebration of Bangladesh.
In a historic war against desirability, the victory of Bangladesh was unprecedented in the leadership of Banga-Band.
On such a special day, the brothers of Bangladesh, the brothers of the country, want to go ahead in the development path of Bangladesh by informing many purifications during the Independence Day celebrations.
A powerful pattern to Bangladesh, a good sweet country, saved peace security in this Yavat area with you, will continue to give full support to India to step down on the direction of development.
Our Rabindranath Tagore memorials glorifying our partnership heritage to our two countries.
Because our goddess Rabindranath Tagore, the Bengali national song.
An interesting event about Rabindranath Tagore is that he was the first person to honor the Nobel laureate in 1913.
Not only that, the British also gave him the title of Knighthood.
In 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was also one of the rebellious Mahamanshis when the British created the Maran Hom in the Jalianwala Bagh.
This incident is time to show a strong influence on the mind of a 12-year-old boy.
In the childhood of singing singing, this Jealian Wala Bag gave her an inspiration to the child's life.
In 1919, when the tiny dread of twelves favoured us, the inspired martyr Bhagat Singh.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh Nu, his two friends Sukhdev, Rajguru Lanu climbed the British.
That incident, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, without the death of Mukhuri, knows the joy of serving the Goddess of India.
They have incorporated all their dreams towards their lives to describe the Goddess of India.
Even today these three giants inspire us.
We can't even put the song of life surrenders to Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru.
Yavat was afraid of this fucking kingdom of the British empire.
Even though they were in jail, they were worried about how they were British.
Therefore, whoever doesn't have to run the sentence on the 24th of March, the 23rd of March has been punished.
Besides, their deaths were stolen and enjoyed to the Punjab region.
A lot of people have a kind of consequences in my body when I first went to that place.
Whenever there is a chance, I am referring to the country's youth as well as the mothers of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, and visiting the Majesty of Batkeshwar Dat.
At that time, for freedom, its intensity, its quantity grows.
On one side, the jawans like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru inspired young people for a civil revolution.
Mahatma Gandhi Champaran was verified on 10th April 1917 before it came right.
This is the year of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the freedom struggle of India, Gandhiji's behavior style was first known only during Champaran.
This incident is a milestone in the whole of the fight for freedom, especially for fighting Taluku methods.
At this time, Champaran satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, Mill workers of Ahmadabad.
In all this, Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts, behavior style, Taluko has a strong effect.
In 1915 Gandhiji returned from foreign countries .
Going to a small village in Bihar in 1917, he gave a new inspiration to the country.
Now on the basis of the form of Mahatma Gandhi situated in our mind we can not ignore the effect of the Satyagraha of Champaran.
Imagine.
In 1915, only two acts were carried out by a man who returned to India.
The country doesn't drive him before.
He didn't influence the country.
That's the beginning.
We can imagine how much trouble he has to face at that time.
Champaran has shown the magnificent powers of Mahatma Gandhi, the power to know the Indian society, the disappointed people of the British empire, the immunity of the British empire, unite for fighting, inspire, fighting, etc.
That is why we can see Gandhiji 's world form .
If you know about Gandhiji at the time of the Champaran satyagraha that had happened in one of the years, it is impossible for any person who starts ordinary life to know the satyagraha of Champaran.
How to start ordinary life, how much work yourself, can learn from Gandhiji who did it.
Rajendra Babuji, Acharya Kripalaniji, we heard all the big Digja Netal, at the same time Gandhiji sent to the village.
Together with the people, how taught it to color the freedom fighter in the work of people.
The British did not understand Gandhiji's methodology.
Fights, thoughts both run together.
Gandhiji made it two faces of the same coin .
One fight, the other thought.
Staying in prisons on one side, restraining on the other side.
A strange balance is in the work style of Gandhiji.
What is the word of Satyagraha, that is, something, helplessness, something that has been seen to the greatest empire.
One complete understanding was seen by Gandhiji through a successful experiment other than words .
Now, while celebrating the centenary celebrations of the Champaran Satyagraha Talu of the country, the power of the common man of India has become so dangerous that the unequality of freedom movement is a surprising journey from the kingdom of the country, the imagination power of the people of hundreds of old folks is noble to their industry.
Sarvajan Hitay : By taking the original spell of happiness, so much for the country, for society, sizes the dreams of the great men who have been killed for the unprecedented liberty.
Now when we move towards twenty-two centuries, which Indian does not want to turn into a country
Which Indian does not want to be a partner of the change in the country .
Trying to make changes to the people of older crores, this is the strongest reward for new India.
New India is not a government programme.
There's no pledge for the election of any political parties.
Not Projectu.
Invite the people of the country to the older millions of ' New India '.
The feeling that people of hundreds of old crores want to build a magnificent India together are ' New India ' .
There's a hope in the minds of the people of millions of old people.
There's a desire, a vision, an excitement.
Beloved my countrymen, we come out of our hard mindset life, see what's happening in the society with a sense of life, look at what's happening in the neighborhood, trying to understand, the aimed people are determined to negotiate society without their own obligations, for the news of robbery, obstacles, fools, something to live for the slaughter.
They're also doing their jobs like a penance, like a means, like a serving sermon.
There are many people who serve patients everyday after going to the hospital.
Blood donation means everyone who runs along.
They're all the ones who provide food facilities to the pawn.
We're the land of a son like all the gems.
Mother Goddess Madhav Seva ' is in our blood source.
Once it looks like a sympathetic, consistently, it's really a big shot.
When the word 'New India' comes, it's thought about it, it's natural to look at it from different perspectives.
It's also necessary in democracy.
But once the people of the older crores of countries imagine that if they choose a furnace for their conceptions , then one step forward , the nympathizer of the people of the country , New India , will be able to look at our eyes .
All these budgets don't have to happen with government funds, not by the government's dates.
Each man has to imagine the traffic rules.
Imagine your responsibilities to be fulfilled, every citizen should possibly compete with petrol, diesel one day a week.
These are all simple things
But you see the country at that time.
The dream of the people of hundreds of old crores of nations ' New India ' appears to be visible in front of our eyes .
It's said, every citizen should follow the religion of civilization.
Responsibilities.
Then there's a cleaning for the same New India.
2022 Kala will come to India and get 75.
Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, remember Raj Guru.
Champaran's gonna take the satyagraha.
Shall we also participate in the journey of ' Surajya' from the sword of our life , convincing
I'm invited to you.
Come on
Beloved my country, I'm telling you my thanks.
In the past few months, if there is any weather in our country, the very high people have participated in digital complications, digits and dancing.
There's an increase in the excitement of illegal behavior.
Silent people are also trying to learn those comrades.
People are also running ahead knowing how to do business without gradually.
After roaming the mouth many kinds of digital problems can be seen very much .
Only two-and-a-half months starting Bhima's app, nearly one and a half crore people loaded this app down.
My country's people have to run the fight against black money, sweetheart.
Can the people of hundreds of old crores imagine that during this period two and a half thousand crores of digital lavades can be lost
We declare in the budget.
If they head for this work done for the people of hundreds of old crores, they don't work to stop for a year.
Can be completed in six months.
Two and a half thousand crores of digital lava ladies - the taste tied in the middle of the naked is not digital.
Travelling in the trains, traveling in the air will celebrate digital drills.
Buying medicines do digital payments.
We're supposed to trade rice by digital system.
We can do all this in our daily life.
You can't imagine how much you can serve the country.
Black money, you can become a hero soldier in the fight against swimming.
In the last few days, there have been many programs of Digi-Dhan Mala Taluo to make people aware of all this.
I suppose a hundred such programs in the country of Yawad.
80-85 events have been done.
There are also prizes in them.
Nearby around twelve and a half million people have made the pride of consumers.
Thousands of thousands of people have arranged for traders.
Everyone supposed to run this work forward.
Dr. Baba Saheb Ambadkar Jayanti on April 14.
It is sure that on April 14, April, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambadkar Jayanti will end this design fair.
There's been a big final event just after completing hundred days.
One of the big drags is directed in it.
I believe Dr. Babasaheb Ambadkar's victory is far more than our time, so far Bhima Aap is being broadcast.
We'll do our job to reduce the use of cash, to reduce the behavior with our mouths.
My country's favourite Vasulara, I'm very pleased to have many kinds of advices when I ask for advice every time.
But there's only every sari snap in the matter of cleanliness.
The girl who is studying 11th grade sent a message by phone from Deh Ra Dun.
"Garoo, Chief Minister Garu, my honorable greetings to you."
First of all, many pursuits to win you with most ships in this meeting.
I want to talk to you in my mind.
I guess people know how clean it needs.
I'll travel every day through a river that polluted people very ruined.
That river comes across our house through the reception bridge.
For this river we went to the towns and swimming.
Talk to the people.
But, there's nothing to do with that.
I'd like to tell you, you sent a client, or want to bring this thing into the light through the newspapers.
Thanks is in that message.
Look, brother-in-law, how much trouble a child studying in the 11th class.
Look how angry she sees the shit of that river.
I know it cleanly.
I'm sorry to get angry with the unconsciousness of the people of hundreds of old crores.
Once anger begins, unsuccessfulness, if there is anger, we'll apply something to do with unconsciousness.
It's a good thing to tell the Ghaitor himself his anger.
He told me to advise, he'd failed all his efforts.
Since the cleaning ceremony, all the people have been disappeared.
Everyone is going ahead fighting their efforts in it.
He turned into fun.
Don't worry about unpleasantness.
Absolutely, if it's actual partner, it's fun, it's so important for them.
But the clarity is always tied up with a habit even more than the envoy.
It's the fate to change the habits.
This mission is a fountain to raise the purity habits.
Festival is synonymous.
It's hard.
But, maybe.
I believe that in the country's new age, in childhood, in the students, the idea of awakening youngsters is a good consequence.
I want all the people of the country to change the message of Ghattri, everybody who listened to Ghattri in the word "Mansu.
Lovely my countrymen, many people have given me a lot of information on the same thing from the beginning of the "Speak in Mansu" program.
It's about fucking food.
We know we're eating in the house, we're gonna have food in our knives more than the requirements in the luggage.
It'll be difficult to eat after putting everything found in the skull.
Not even half of them put in the knife, they'll come leaving there.
Do you ever think of how much harm we do by leaving these figs
If you do not leave it by swimming , then do you ever think of all the lips of stomach .
It's not a matter of understanding.
When we finish small kids in our house, you can eat Eat as much as you want to sell.
Something's gonna be trying.
But it's social throne to be indifferent to this matter.
It's supposed to be humiliated.
Another complicity, if you're alive, it's the financial benefit of the family too.
It's a good thing in society.
But it's like this, it's good for the family too.
I don't want to say much about this, but I just want to grow unprecedented.
I don't fly some young men who enjoy such things.
They made some mobile apps.
Wherever such food is left, they go there and bring that food to one place and make it difficult to sustain it.
It's just a young man in our country.
In every state of our country such people will be seen to you somewhere.
Their lives also make us sweat, telling us how much we can eat.
Look, there are these ways to change.
Those who are careful about the body and the health say , keep a little empty in the belly , keep a little empty in the shade .
The health matter is so April 7th World Health Day celebration.
Until 2030 the United Nations Health Coverage has decided the goal of ' all health ' .
This time, the 7th Tarikhi of the ICT April focused on depression during the World Health Day celebrations.
This time their main point is depression.
We also know the word depression.
But somebody's called kungbat to understand.
According to an estimate, people above 35 crores of the world are suffering from mental depression.
The danger is that we'll see this incident even in those around us.
We also like to talk about this incident out of love.
The person who is suffering from depression also doesn't speak about it.
Because, that guy also smiles to discuss it.
I would like to say to the countrymen not to get rid of depression.
It starts getting rid of a mental environment.
That's the first mission that requires expression instead of surprising.
That's to explain it out without ignoring depression.
At your friends, at the parents, in the middle of the paws, tell me what you have with teachers.
Children living in the restaurant sometimes get so much trouble because of loneliness.
The beauty of our country, we grew up in combination families.
So there's no shape for depression, so we're mixing with big families.
But, I would like to say to some parents - whenever you think, once your kids or other family members, don't come to the table that they're having food together before.
Everyone in the house goes out, if I like to stay alone, don't you see what you're doing
You believe it's the first step towards depression.
If they're stepping on the side of the group, they're not trying to see it happening.
Give them the chance to be between whoever talks with them.
Laughing, talking happy things, inspire them to express their views.
Give it out where there's no disappointment in their minds.
That's the best way.
This depression is caused by physical, mental illness.
Like diabetes is the root of all kinds of diseases, even if depression stops, fights, adventures, destroys all the ability to take decisions.
Your friends, your family, your premises, your environment.
Everything together can stop you without going into depression.
If you go into it, you can take it out.
There's another way too.
If you don't express your views, you can't break your mind between yours, do a job.
Go to the guys working around your neighborhood, help them.
Help me with your mind.
Participate their painful happiness.
Then look at you.
Your suffering will disappear.
If they try to understand their sadness, they'll have a new self-confidence in you.
When you join others, when someone consumes, you can easily make the weight of your mind easy.
Anyway, yoga is also a nice way to keep mind healthy.
Far away from stress, away from mental labor, Yoga helps a lot to spend life with delight.
The third International Yoga Day on 21st June.
To celebrate social yoga day in a few lakhs of interviews, you will also be able to do so from now on.
If you have any advice about this third international yoga day in your mind, please send your advice to me through your mobile app, suggest ways.
How many songs, artistic writings you can make about Yoga.
They understand people easily.
I've been talking about health so to mothers, sisters, I've told this particularly a congress.
In the last few days, the Government of India has taken a major decision.
The number of employees in our country is increasing day by day.
It's a matter of being welcomed to increase their partnership in the working class.
There are also special responsibilities for women playing with it.
Besides family responsibilities, they must also be involved in financial responsibility.
That's why sometimes or sometimes the children born are neglected.
Therefore, the Government of India has taken a big decision.
During the pregnancy of the women who have this work group, we have now increased the delivery of 12 weeks before delivery for 26 weeks.
In this case, two three countries in the world are ahead of us.
India has taken such an excellent decision to enjoy all these sisters.
Its main privilege is to protect the newly born baby, to make India's emotional citizen the beauty of right care at the beginning of his birth, to get love of the mother, then these children grow up and become good energy for the country.
Then we took such an important decision that the health of the mothers is also good.
Approximately 18 lakh women working in the formal sector benefit from this .
Lovely my country, Vasulara, on 5th April, Ram Nawami festival.
Mahavir Jayanti on 9th April.
Dr. Babasaheb Ambadkar Jayanti on April 14.
All these great men must be giving us so much inspiration.
Give the power to vision for New India.
Two days later, Chaitra was bad.
New Year's first fault.
During this new year, many pursuits for all of you.
After the spring season, all our farmers got the benefit of work, the crops were time to come to hand.
In different parts of our country this new year is celebrated with different names .
In the new year entrance of Maharashtra ' Gudi Padwa ' , ' Ugadi ' in Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka , ' Cheti-Chand ' of Sindhis , Kashmiri Nav Reh ' , Avadh in Awadh , Jud Shital in Midhils of Bihar , Satwani festivals are held in Magadh .
India is a country with all the differences that cannot count.
During the New Year, all of you are very much appreciated on my own.
Thank you a lot.
.
