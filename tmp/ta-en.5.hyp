Man Ki Pat, the folks of September 2018, salvation.
Let's say nobody can be the Indians who don't grow up on our fathers.
Every Indian...
.
Even if he belongs to any department...
.
Library, time, method or language...
.
Provide your happiness on our armymen, and show your support always ready.
Nearly 125 crore folk folks of India celebrated the valor of Parakaram Berva .
We remembered the comprehensive attack in 2016.
Our military personnel have given a strong answer to the hiding force that took place in the war against our country.
The citizens of the country, especially the youth, have arranged for our military visions at different places in the country.
Look how capable we are, how our army personnel protect our folks with their lives.
One day like a parava, young men remember the great tradition of our military personnel.
And we're enjoying to ensure the balance and unity of the country.
I also participated in a program in Jodhpur of Veer Museum Rajasthan .
Now it has been decided that our army will give them a lot of answers to the efforts to divide the peace and development environment of our country.
It's not possible for us to pay the price of the country's maritime by paying the miracle at the same time, we're loyal to those who believe in peace.
India has promised peace to be established, has come from the feeling of dedication.
In the two world wars of the 20th century, more than one lakh troops, peace make your biggest sacrifice, even if there's no contact with us in those wars.
Our eyes don't read the others on Earth.
It shows us the sweetheart of peace.
On the 23rd of September we remembered our valorous warriors of Mysore, Patna and Jodhpur Lancers on the 100th year of the Haif War of Israel.
They freed Haifa from the victims.
This is also a comprehensive act by our military personnel in the direction of peace.
Even today.
Nah.
India is one of the countries that send more warriors to various peace forces.
For many years our valorous military personnel have been able to wear blue helmets and make the world a major part of peace.
My folks are different from the things related to the wind.
In such a way, it is not surprising that the Indian Air Force has attracted the attention of everybody in the air.
They've given us a safe feeling.
With the freedom of the threshold, with great desire for dressing, one of the air strikes that people are waiting.
In this, our aircraft will expel your power with the dreadful activity.
We're celebrating the Air Force Day on the 8th day of October.
In 1932, 6 airplanes and 19 aircraft fighters have started a small merchandise, today they have a place in the most powerful and powerful aircraft of the 21st century.
It's a journey to swim our memories.
I'm supposed to give life to all the aircraft personnel who serve you for the country and their family.
In the 1974 anti-Pakistan civilians, when they touched the attack, our planes decided to save Mr. City from the attackers, slaughtered the weapons of the Indian military personnel at the right time in the battlefields.
In 1965, the aircraft had given a lot of answer to the enemy.
Who are not aware of the freedom struggle in the 1971 AD
In 1999, our aircraft has played an important role in the removal of the Karkhil region from the hunters.
At the places of Tiger Hill the enemies used to roam the soil after raining all night .
Meetings and restraint works, arrangements for hometowns, thanks to the country's aircraft because of the operations of our aircraft fighters.
Flood, hot, flood first, all the households up to Wildlife, help the folk, their feelings are unique.
In the country, the air force has advanced a television, opening the doors of each of your departments for women.
Now there's a change in the air force that joins women, with short-term work.
I had done this information from the Red Fort on the 15th day of August this year .
We can say that the partition of women's power grows in the same quantity, not only male power to the military warrior of the Indian Army.
Female power generations come to you, but now they're being armed.
My folks, in the past, our officer, who was involved in the Trekks, was fighting the struggle of Abilash Domi, Jivana Sawa.
Tommy was worried about how to protect the country.
You know that Abilash Tommy is an officer with very comfort.
He was the first Indian to travel worldwide, without any modern technology support, traveling in a small boat.
For the past 80 days, he ran away from the Golden Globe race in the southern part of the Indian Sea, without reducing his speed on the sea.
But the horrific sea warriors had confronted him, the warriors of India's trumpets had been fighting in the sea for many days.
Even if he fought without eating anything, he didn't accept defeat in his life.
He's an extraordinary specimen of sagas, psychology, consequences.
A few days ago, when I brought Abilash out of the sea, I talked to him with a phone call.
I've already met Tommy.
He didn't have any interest in composing these compositions, and believed, and then he conveyed to me the obligation of the negotiating action like this.
He is a prediction for the younger community of the country.
I pray for the special health of Abhilash Tommy, his sympathy, his nervousness, the power of the light, will surely enjoy our young men.
My folk folks, every child of the country will enjoy what our country is worth on the 2nd day of October.
This year is more important than the 2nd day of October.
Now, for the next few months, we will send a series of programs across the world before the 150th birthday of Gandhiji.
The ideas of Gandhians are encouraging the whole world.
Dr.
Martin's Luther King Junior, the meat becomes soil...
Your people have been obtained from the ideas of Gandhians who have a long struggle for equality and pride.
Today, I'd like to talk to you about the smell of the heart, the silly blood and an important act, to make folks aware of it.
In the year 1941, Gandhian Constructive Programme started writing some thoughts in the form of a preparation plan.
Afterwards, when the freedom struggle took place in 1945, he prepared a collective copy of those thoughts.
Folks have preserved their views regarding various matters like the rights of salvation, safety, sanitation, education of farmers, villages, workers.
It is also called Gandhi Charter .
It was naturally her.
It's all the reputations of his being associated with the people, they're drunk in his own nature.
Everyone has experienced it as a very popular form of his personality.
He made every human feeling that everybody is very important to the nation, inevitable.
It was his biggest participant in the freedom struggle that transformed it into a spreading mass struggle.
In the freedom struggle, all the sections of the society, all the spellmen, put themselves in front of you.
He has given us a mantra of enlightenment, which is often called Gandhi's race.
What the bird says in it, "I give you a coffee rock, whenever you have an understanding, the feeling of 'thana' is in you, take such a quantity of colleak - who is very hard and weak, look at that man, remember his face, listen to your mind, so listen to what action you are doing, so that the person will benefit.
This will make her life and future glimpse
Those millions of people can get self-confidence from the rottenness of the stomach and the bitterness of the mind
Then you can see your doubts sliding with you, your mate disappeared.
The folk loving for me, this coffee of the Gandhians is equally important even today.
Increasing the centralized people in the country today, their economic power, the power to buy them...
.
Can we remember a moment when we buy something
Can you remember that coffee of the man
If you buy, you can't see that any drunken guy in my country will benefit
Whose face is very happy
Whoever you buys is directly or hidden
My happiness is comfortable if it's good for the hard work.
Considering this mantra of Gandhiji, when we all buy anything in the days to come, in the view of the 150th birthday of the Gandhians, when we buy everything, we have to walk well, especially those who sneeze your sweat to make it, whoever possessesses your wealth in it, remember that they should get any benefit for everyone.
This is the mantra of Gandhians...
This is his message...
.
I'm sure your little effort in the lives of a very weak man's supporter, a greatest consequence.
My folks, folks, will get freedom if they do mischief.
He might have known how it was going to happen - but this happened, India got freedom.
I'm supposed to be the biggest participant of my country's economic mambad, economic empowerment, enforcement, to gain the power to fight against its deepness.
But in today's quantity, this is the real patriotism, I believe that it's the caravanage we give to him.
In special occasions buying garlands and handicrafts will help many insistants .
Lal Bhadur Sastri kept the old trails, rolled clothes and safeguards, because somebody's work is missing in it.
He would say that these trails are all very nervous, they should use each of these works.
In the country, in the territory of the country, the size of a small idol was mixed in every corner of the walls.
We celebrated his birthday two days with salty breasts.
As soon as Sastri supposes his name, we can feel a sympathetic sympathy in our minds, like the Indians.
His personality, folk and folk makes everybody glory.
The importance of Lal Bhadur Shastri, who was with him, would be very sweet at the outskirts, but inwardly rock-like rocks.
His treasure named Jai Jai Kishen is the symbol of his close personality.
As a result of the self-sacrifice of the nation, in a short period of just one and a half years, it was possible to give him the mantra to achieve success in the country's warriors and farmers.
My folks, you're a natural thing about the sacredness when we remember the honorable dinner today
On the 15th day of September a campaign called sanctity service was started .
Millions of people joined you in this campaign, and there was a chance to serve the children of Ambethak school in Delhi.
It's the valuable Papa Sacafe who built that school base.
All over the country, all kinds of people are engaged in this service on the 15th day.
The organisations also gave you partitions with great enthusiasm.
School children, college students, national students, public health planners, youth organizations, community groups, people of masses, have served in large quantities in cleanliness.
I'm demonstrating my heartfelt appreciations to the people who love all the sacred people for the partition of all.
Let's call a phone call.
Well, my name is Shaytan Singh, speaking from the bouquet of the Bikaner district of Rajasthan state.
I'm unaware.
I don't have the vision potential on both my eyes.
I believe that the stairs that they carry through the voice of the mind are very important in relation to pure India .
We were very difficult to go to the toilet without vision.
Now that every house has been spent, we have had a big chance of it.
He's done a predecessor, and he's crossing this work.
Thank you so much.
You're pretending to be the biggest black.
There is a significance of cleanliness in everyone's life.
Your home absorption is made according to the sacred India campaign, so that you are comfortable, what else can be the more pleasant thing for us than this
In the absence of vision, the deepness of how many places you had to meet in the absence of observation, could not be as much as the people associated with this operation.
But if you didn't say how it was a comfort for you after the toilets, you couldn't get the attention of the people associated with this operation.
I'm determining my thanks to you in a special way.
My heart has become a success story in the world, not only in our country, but also in the country.
Everyone's talking about it.
This time, India, is being arranged for the world's largest purely plains.
In the International Sanitation Market of Mahatma Gandhi i.e. Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, Health Ministers and Departmental Scientists all over the world share their awareness and experiences related to cleanliness.
Mahatma Gandhi International Festival Festival is held on the 2nd day of October this year , the beginning of the 150th birthday of his birthday .
My folk, there is a case in the Samskrit - the roots of the self-esteem are in the law, the feelings of human rights are full of it when it speaks about justice.
It's important to ensure the freedom, peace and justice of the embarrassed, suffered, deprived people.
Dr.
There are many instruments to protect the fundamental rights of competitors in the capital legislation provided by the Papasacket Ambethkar.
NHRC was established on 12th October , 1993 AD on the day of October 12th .
This jurisdiction has been completed in 25 years.
This jurisdiction enhances the work of man's mirror not only to protect human rights.
Our hearts' closest head, Atal Bihari Wazboy, they say we don't have the same principle as human rights.
The principle of our national human rights in the memory of the trial has been engraved by the Serve Pavandhu Suken.
This jurisdiction has led to the spread of human rights, apart from its wrong use, the participant of appreciation.
This 25-year-old journey has made a neighbourhood, a hopeful environment for the people.
For a healthy society, it provides the process of reliability to the important Great Jews.
Today, along with the functions of human rights in the national level, 26 state human rights are also being run.
As a community, we understand the importance of human rights, it needs to be followed in practice.
This is the basis for everyone, the progress of everyone.
My folks, in the month of October, Jai Prakash Narayan, they come to the beginning of the centuries of their birth.
These magicians are all enjoying us, we remember them.
On the 31st day of October, Sardar's birthday comes, I'll talk about it in the next voice.
But why do you want to describe him today, for some years Sardar's birthday is being arranged on the 31st day of October, every small town of India, in the villages.
This year, we have to make efforts to arrange this drive for our villages, regions, cities, cities.
The drive is the only way to see them specially thinking about them because they worked for the nation's supremacy throughout their lives.
I'm asking all of you, on the 31st day of October, every section of the community, we have to give strength to our efforts of unity, unity, unity of the country, and that's how it's going to be a special thrill for him.
I'm the folk, the navrataria, the worship of Durga, the victory of victory.
Thanks, for all these sacred periods, and I'm definitely definite my heartfelt life for all of you.
