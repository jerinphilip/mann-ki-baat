What's the mind, my dear countrymen, October 2016, you're not very happy with Deepavali.
In every corner of India, festivals of Deepavali are celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
India is such a country, where for 365 days a festival is seen in some parts of the country.
Watching our country far away, they may be sometimes in such a way that the Indian life is the second name of the festival, and it's very natural.
The tradition of festivals in India since the time of the eve, is a changing festival of time.
We have easily accepted a variety of changes in the festival according to the time of the end of a few ceremonial festivals.
But in all this time, we are able to see a good thing that India has been the most celebrated journey, its depth, its depth, its impact on every person for the whole year - this is all connected with the same original spell - moving the person towards the group.
By propagating a person and personality, an effort to spread their limited thoughts from the thunderstorms to the universe continues.
And it can be done through this festival.
Sometimes the festival in India seems to be the pride of eating.
But there is also anxiety in them - what should be the festival of the season and what should be eaten there .
Farmers are cultivating crops and how the crops can be linked to the festival, what kind of culture should be considered for disease free, all the thoughts, etc. have mixed up with our predecessor scientific methods.
Today is thinking about the world's neighborhood.
It's a matter of concern that the nature is destroyed.
There, this tradition of festival in India makes nature love more powerful.
From the boy to make everybody happy.
Vrikshava Gulam, river, animals, mountains - whatever, everybody's responsibility is celebrated.
Today, we celebrate everyday as a holiday day.
But the people of the old days, the workers, the funny, you'll be watching, our traditions in hundreds of years were celebrated in full moon and moonlight.
And science has proven what kind of changes come in the water of the sea in Purnima and Ambassya, the effect of coconut things on nature and its impact on human minds.
That's why our holidays here have been a tradition of accomplishing science with the universe.
Today, when we celebrate Diwali celebrations, as I said, every festival of us is educated, brings a sense of education.
This festival of Deepavali gives a message from darkness to light .
And darkness - the darkness is not the darkness, the darkness of darkness, the darkness of education, the darkness of poverty, the darkness of social injustice.
Social fault: Festival of light from darkness, liberating the light of the personal fault.
One thing we all know well, on any territory of India, the hut of rich or poor poverty can be observed in every family during Diwali.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
The poor man also cleans his soil in such a way that the Deepavali has come.
Deepavali is a cleaner drive.
But the claim of time is not just the cleverness of the house, the cleanness of the entire environment, the cleanliness of all the villages, the cleanliness of the whole village - we have to spread this tradition and spread more.
This festival of Deepavali is not confined to India, every country of the world is celebrated in some way.
The government of any place in the world, the Parliament, the ruler, became part of the celebrations of Sabdeepavali.
Whether it is in the east or in the west, the evergreen bountain, Africa or Airland.
You know, of course, the US US postal service has published a pocket this year in Deepavaliuplaksh.
During the time of Prime Minister Deepavali of Canada , Pradipwali : He took this picture and shared it with everyone through a tower.
In London, the Prime Minister of Britain, for Deepavali, organized a program with everyone and participated in it.
There may be no city in Aurou... where Deepavali is not celebrated with Dumdham.
Through Singapore's Prime Minister Instagram, the picture of celebrating Deepavali festival has shared with the whole world with great enthusiasm.
And what is that photo
Singapore Parivartian 16 female members have taken photographs outside the Parliament after the Indian saris and that photo is spread in the social networking site.
And all this has been done for Deepavali.
Deepavali festival is celebrated everywhere in Singapore.
The Australian Prime Minister has told all Indians the good news of Deepavali.
In Yesang, all the people of Australia have been invited to join the Deepavali festival.
Recently, the Prime Minister of New ealand came, he told me that he had to go back soon, because he would have to take part in the Deepavali festival.
I wish to say that the festival of Deepavali light, inspires everyone from darkness to light this festival.
Good clothes and clothes in the festival of Deepavali are arranged with good food and drinks with great enthusiasm.
And very little people enjoy it.
But sometimes you're sorry.
A lot of bets gathering so that there is a lot of noise, but it also invites accidents.
Sometimes they don't care if there's a kizzines around, it's easy to catch fire.
The news of the accident at the time of Deepavali, the news of the fire, the news of the immortality is very tired.
And there is a discomfort in the time of Deepavali - Doctors often go to Deepavali to celebrate Diwali with all the families in Deepavali.
It's a danger to the dangers.
My parents, especially my parents, are requested to stay with the elders when the kids are betting, and there is no mistake.
Deepavali festival is too long in our country.
It's not just a day, Govardhan Puja, Brotherhood, from Love-fifth to Kartik-Purima for a long time.
With this we also organize the Chhat Puja.
Puja in the eastern territory of India is a big festival.
It's a kind of pride.
This festival continues for four days.
But its specialty is that this festival gives a deep message to society.
Lord Suryadev drove us, we'll find everything.
It is very difficult for us to get rid of what we can from the Lord of the Sun.
We've got so much from the sun.
Chhat Puja is the celebration of the sun worship.
There is a prophecy that all the people of the world worship the sun.
Chhat Puja is a festival where the unstable sun is worshipped.
There's a very big social message.
I'm talking about the festival of Deepawali, speak of Chhat Puja, this is the time you give you a lot of good wishes, especially to thank the countrymen, to express gratitude.
In the last few months, all the events that took place, every Jew of our army sacrificed everything for us.
In my mind, army joys - the sacrifice of the soldiers of the security forces, the rituals, the hard work has made a special effect.
And that's why I think it's the name of this Deepavali security force.
I called the countrymen to take part in an airplane by the name of Sandesh to Soldzers.
But today I want to say that there is no such person in India, who does not love the soldiers of the country, not proud of the army, the defense forces.
The way people published it will give more power to the countrymen.
We can't imagine for the security forces, how powerful a message gives them.
Schools, colleges, villages, poor, businessmen, shopkeepers, patrons, players or people in the film world - no one who did not burn the light for the people of the country, did not give messages to the people of the country.
Ganamadam also took this Deepottva as an opportunity to thank the soldiers.
And why don't you - BSF Hock, C.R.P.F. Hock, Indo-Tebeton Police, Assam Rifles, Navy, Passenger or Air Force, or Coast Guard, I can't tell all the names, I don't know what kind of hardships our people suffer.
When we are celebrating, somebody in the desert, some of the Himalayas, some are protecting the artists, some are protecting the airport.
What kind of responsibility they're paying.
Whenever we're imagined, we remember them, there's a new power.
That's what the natives have done.
I really want to express gratitude to the countrymen.
The artist who has sent a message through the art, someone has created pictures, alphanas, cartoons, who have enriched Saraswati towards it, wrote poetry.
Someone wrote a slogan.
I think my 'Narendramodi Ape' or my 'My Gave' is pouring the waves of the countrymen's thinking- through the words, through the writings, and the colors.
I can imagine how proud it is for my country's people.
Sandesh to Soldzers... this is a message in Hashtag, that's what it looks like.
Mr. Ashwani Kumar Chauhan has written a poem, I want to read it.
Ashwani Kumar wrote: "I celebrate, sananda, sahasya.
I celebrate the festival, sahasya.
I'm telling you today, it's possible that you are.
My freedom is because of you, you're the source of my happiness, I'm asleep because I'm asleep because you're in the underground garden, mountain, sky and the landscape, the hero fighter, I'll tell you a hundred times.
"My dear countrymen, a father's house and a father-in-law- many of the two families were working in the army, such a sister, Shivani sent me a telephone message.
Come on, this soldier's family is kissing: "Namaskar Pradhan Mantraji, I'm Shivani Mahon.
In this Deepavali, the Sandesh to Soldzer's campaign has begun, our fauji brothers got special enthusiasm.
My family is a military family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and father were the army officer.
The army officers we have in the border and all of our circulars have emerged this 'Sandesh' special inspiration.
I mean, my officers and soldiers have to sacrifice their wife and the whole family enough.
So there's a magnificent message to the entire army group.
I want to tell you "Happy Diwali", thank you
"My dear patriots, it's right, not just the soldiers who live in the border, but in many places of their lives.
Our brave soldiers are moving forward to patriotism in every way of life.
There's something I've noticed, which I want to tell you.
It's his vision, how some success becomes a great power.
You keep listening, the free toilets in Himachal Pradesh have been possible.
Sikim had already achieved this success.
Carol's name has been linked to this list since November 1.
How did this success come, that's what we said - There is a Jowan of I-T-B-P in our army, Shri Vikas Thakur, his house went to the village in the vacation of a small village of Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The village council was running at that time.
He reached the meeting.
In the village gathering, there was talk of making toilets.
This discussion shows that some families are not able to build households in the absence of money.
Listening to the patriotic Jowan Vikas Tagore, this clan needs folks.
Not only that they served the country for shooting on the enemy, but also with the head of a check cute of Rs.57 thousand rupees, he said, "The 57 families have not been able to make toilet for money, give them one thousand rupees to each of them, so that they make the house toilet and make the Badhana village open toilet.
"Development Tagore has done it.
The 57 families have emerged from their own pockets with a thousand rupees for self-confidence.
This way the Himachal Pradesh has become a free state of open toilet.
Like this, I'm grateful to the young people of Kerala.
I remember, there's no good way to go to Kerala's primitive jungle area, to reach the footsteps all day - like a tribal panchayat, Idmalakudi.
No one's easier going there.
Students of the nearest city engineering college think they need toilets in that village.
Members of NCC Cadet, NSS, engineering colleges, all together, we're gonna make the toilet.
These young men walked to Isgangal throughout the day with other materials of making bricks, cements and toilets in their shoulders.
Build yourself to toilet.
And in this remote jungle, one village was made open toiletless.
That's how the Kerala kingdom is going to be free.
More than one and a half million municipalities and corporations have been declared toilet free in Gujarat.
Ten districts have also come in this list.
He's been safer than Hariyana.
Tomorrow 1st November, the state of Haryana is going to celebrate the Suvarnajayanti.
They've decided to make an open toiletless state within a few months.
They already completed this work in seven districts.
This work is going on with utmost every kingdom.
I just mentioned a few.
I'm congratulating the citizens of all these kingdoms to join this magnificent work, for the end of darkness from the country.
My dear patriots, sirks have planned a lot.
After the first plan, if a better plan comes from him, then the first one has to be removed.
But generally nobody looks at it.
As a result, new plans are going on with the old plan and waiting for the next plan.
There's no need for kerosene in all the houses in our country that have gas, electricity.
But who's looking for her in the government
Kerosene is also going, gas is going, electricity is also going.
And his father-in-law is Poyabaro.
I want to congratulate Hariyana, because they've done their kingdom out of Kerosin.
Non-one family has gas loans, they have electricity connections, they've confirmed it by the base number.
I heard, seven or eight districts of Kerosene were released in the Cerezzy.
The way they took the Ecaze, I think the whole kingdom will be very shiggery kerosene-free.
How big is the change
The stealing will be closed, the environment will benefit, our foreign currency will be saved and the common man's facilitators will increase.
Yeah, if it's hard, it'll be Dalal and Baeman.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi always guides us all.
What the country will do, how to do, he is still considered to be a demon in his way.
Gandhiji said, whenever you plan, remember the poor and weakest of the country and then think of what you're going to do, there will be no benefit of these people.
Don't they have any harm
You're gonna make a decision by remembering it.
It's the time that the highness that has grown in the poor will have to give the right importance.
We have to take a step after one to get rid of the problem.
We have to distinguish between boys and girls in society, as we do.
Now there's toilet for students in school.
There's also a toilet for the students.
This opportunity is a specimen of diversity in our Indian society to our daughters.
The government is securing, but even a million children are left out of the vaccination system.
He's a victim of disease.
"Mission Indra Dhanush" is such a campaign, in which the children who are released are also being treated.
This communication involves strength to liberate the children from dangerous diseases.
The village will be dark in a century, it's not.
The campaign to get the village out of the blindness of the village is going on with success.
Work is going on before charity.
After so many years of independence, the mother cooked in a wooden wooden smoke around 400 cigarettes in her body, what will her health be
Trying to free five million families from smoke.
This mission is also going on with success.
Small businessmen, small shopkeepers, vegetables, milk sellers, peasants describe swords on the debt of the majesty - very badly rotten.
Month Plan, Stand-Ap Plan, John Dhan Account - It's a successful mission to get rid of all the good.
The meaning is reaching the bank directly through the base card.
Real authors are directly providing financial facilities.
It's time for ordinary people to get rid of the giants.
We have to run an expedition through which there is no change, the way to get rid of the problem, and that's happening.
My loving countrymen, on October 31 tomorrow, the great princes of this country, who invented the unity of India and did it - Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary.
On 31 October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the prince of the solidarity protectors of the country, the sacred date of Srimati Gandhi on the other hand.
We remind of the great men, and we need to do.
But the phone of a gentleman in the panjab, his sorrow touched my heart.
"Prime Minister Mohammedy Namskar.
Your Majesty, I'm telling Jasdeep Panjab.
You know, Mahashay, the birthday of October 31st.
Sorder Pattel is a man who has passed his entire life for the ignorance of his country and I think he's successful in this direction.
He united, and we could say the misfortune of the country or say that Gandhi was killed by those days.
And we all know what happened in the country after his murder.
Your Majesty, I want to tell you how we can stop the lucky hours.
"Followers, this sorrow is not one of them.
A clarion: Sir Vallabhbhai Patel, History is witness to this incident, after Chanakya, the great work of uniting the country has been done by Sardar Vallabhvipatel.
Successful effort to bring free India under the same flag, the great men who did so much work, to give hundreds of blessings to the great men.
But it's too sorry, that the survivor embraced his life for unity, fought, the main objective of the unity of the country, for which how many people were victims of dissatisfaction, but never left the loneliness.
But in the birth anniversary of that survivor thousands of survivors, thousands of servivors, after the killing of Srimati Gandhi, were put on the path of death.
The great man who spent all his life for unity, in his birthday - Atrocities on the survivors, this page of history, pains us all.
But in this hypocrisy, one's spell must be carried forward.
The unity of diversity is the power of the country.
There are many languages, many races, many dresses, many food items, but unity in diversity - this is the power of India, the specialty of India.
Each generation has a responsibility, every government has its responsibility, an example of unity in the corner of the country, develops the unity of the country.
The idea of distinction, the attitude of veda, to protect ourselves and our nation.
Sardar Saheb has given us a "India", our responsibility is to create the highest India".
Equality's original specimen enhances the creation of India.
Sardar Saheb's life started through a farmer's movement, he was a son of a farmer.
Sardar Saheb has given a great credit to spread the movement of freedom struggle among the farmers.
The struggle for freedom was the endeavor of the village to spread power.
It was possible in his concentrational power and trick.
But Sardar Saheb used to combat-not, he's too advanced to form.
At present, we've ever heard the name of Aval.
People from all over India and India are also known today with every act of 'Aval'.
But few people knew that the invisible Sardar Sahib imagined the formation of the Union of Co-operative Producer.
The district of Kheda, which was known by those times known as the district - in 1942, emphasised this idea and its true form was in front of us what Sardar Sahib did for the welfare of the farmers of today .
I'm admiring Sardar Saheb.
On the 31st October unity day, wherever we live, I will remember the sir, imagine unity.
My loving countrymen, after this Diwali, Kartik Purnima, this is also part of light festival.
Guru Nanak, for his educational integrity, for the whole of mankind, only for the year of India, is the right direction for the entire human being.
This is the message of Guru Nanak, the service, the truth and everyone.
Peace, unity and goodwill were his chief spells.
Vedabheda, blind faith, a campaign to free society from Kuriti was in every word of Guru Nanak.
When our society was untouched, untouched, and their disorders were in the peak, Guru Nanak had chosen his brother Lalo.
Come, we too, Guru Nanak, who gave us the light of knowledge, who inspires us to discrete discrimination, observe orders to do something against discrimination.
If we're going ahead with this spell, who's our guide better than Guru Nanak.
I swear to Guru Nanak from the heart at the end of the celebration.
My loving countrymen, once again, this Deepavali, devoted to the country's soldiers, is not much good for you in this Deepavaliuplaksh.
Your dreams, your visions are all successful.
Your life is filled with happiness and calmness, I'm telling all this good news.
Thank you very much
.
