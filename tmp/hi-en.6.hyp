Talking to the mind, August 2018, my dear countrymen
Namaskar
Today the whole country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan .
Best wishes to all the people of this sacred festival .
The festival of Rakshabandhan is considered to be a symbol of mutual love and belief of sister and brother .
This festival has been a major example of social harmony for centuries .
There are many such stories in the history of the country, in which a defense formula had linked people associated with two different states or religions to the door of faith .
Only a few days later , the festival of Janmashtami is going to come .
The whole atmosphere is echoing elephant, horse, palanquin Jai Kanhaiyalal's, Govinda-Govinda's hymn
The joy of swimming in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
In many parts of the country and especially in Maharashtra the preparations for curd and hair will also be doing our youth .
Best wishes for Raksha Bandhana and Janmashtami to all the people .

Comrades
Apart from Raksha Bandhana Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on the day of Shravan Purnima .
I congratulate all those who are engaged in tolerating, dressing this great heritage and reaching the masses
Every language has its own significance . India prouds that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world and we all Indians also proud that since the Vedic period till now Sanskrit language has played a very big role in spreading knowledge .
The store of knowledge associated with every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature .
Whether it is science or nervous, agriculture or health, astronomy or architecture, mathematics or management, economics or environment, says that the mantra of dealing with the challenges of global warming is in detail in our vedas
You will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka are still using Sanskrit language for talks .
You will be surprised to know one thing that Sanskrit is a language in which the creation of infinite words is possible
It is possible to compose countless words from two thousand metals, 200 pertyaya, i.e. Sui, 22 subservients, i.e. prei and society, and therefore any micro-discipline or subject can be accuretory description and there has been a specialty of Sanskrit language, we still use English quotations to make our point strong
Sometimes use lion-shyari but those who are familiar with Sanskrit audience, they know that in very few words so accurate statement is from Sanskrit auspicious and secondly it is also very easy to understand because of our tradition being connected to our land .
Like the importance of the guru in life, it has been said to explain - once Akshramastu, Guru: Disciple Prabodhayet
Prithviyan Nasti Tad-Druya, Yad-Datwa Hyanrini Bhavet
That is, if a Guru gives knowledge of one letter to his disciple, then there is no such thing or wealth in the whole earth, so that the disciple can lift that loan of his master
We all celebrate the coming Teachers Day with this feeling .
Knowledge and guru are incredible, priceless, precious
Apart from the mother, there are only teachers who take responsibility for giving right direction to the ideas of children and whose most impact is also seen throughout the life.
We always remember the great thinker on the occasion of Teacher ' s Day and Dr . Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan , the former President of India .
The whole country celebrates Jayanti as Teacher Day .
I wish all the teachers in the country the coming Teacher's Day as well as congratulate your dedication to science, education and students
My dear countrymen
This hard worker brings the monsoon new hopes to our farmers .
The scorching trees and plants give relief to the dry reservoirs, but sometimes it brings excessive and devastating floods too.
There is such a situation of nature that in some places there is more rain than other places .
Now we all saw it .
The horrific flood in Kerala has badly affected life .
Today in these difficult conditions the whole country stands with Kerala .
Our condolences are with those families who have lost their lives, the damage of life can not be compensated, but I want to assure the condolent families that hundreds of million Indians stand together with you in this hour of sorrow
I pray that those who are injured in this natural calamity, who go to health as soon as possible
I am convinced that Kerala will soon rise again on the strength of the people of the State .
The kind of waste that disasters leave behind them are unfortunate but at the time of disasters, we also see the philosophy of humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari everyone is doing something at their own level so that wherever there is objection .
Whether it is Kerala or else there are more districts of India and there are areas, life can be normal again
All the age groups and people connected to each task sector are contributing
Everyone has been sure that the trouble of the people of Kerala can be done at least, we share their sorrows
We all know that armed forces are the heroes of the rescue operation in Kerala .
They did not leave any stone unturned to save the floods .
Air Force, Navy Ho, Army Ho, BSF, I
SC, RAD, everyone has played a big role in relief and rescue operations
I also want to specifically mention the hard work of the NRCs .
In this moment of crisis , he has done a very good job
The capacity of the NRC has become the center of new reverence for every Indian , trying to take care of the situation by their commitment and quick decision
Tomorrow was the festival of Onam, we will pray that the festival of Onam will give the country more power to Kerala so that they recover from this disaster as soon as possible and the development journey of Kerala gets more speed
Once again, I want to assure all the people of Kerala and in other parts of the country where the disaster has occurred, that the whole country is with them in this hour of crisis
My dear countrymen
This time , I was looking at the suggestions of the mind .
Then the topic on which people from all over the country wrote is the topic "we all dear Sriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee"
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapn Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, Do not know how many countless people have written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App and Mygove and have requested me to talk about various aspects of Atal ji's life
As soon as the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise on August 16, everyone was drowned in mourning
A nation leader who had left the Prime Minister 14 years ago
In a way he had gone far away from active politics for 10 years .
The news did not appear anywhere, publicly did not see
The gap of 10 years is very big but after 16th August , the country and the world saw that in the minds of the common human ( human ) of India these ten years of age did not allow even a moment to interfere .
The kind of affection for Atal ji, the spirit of reverence and condolence that has risen across the country reflects his huge personality
For the last several days , the best aspects of Atalji have come to the country .
People have remembered him as the best MP, sensitive writer, best speaker, popular Prime Minister and do
Good governance will always be grateful to Atal ji, but I want to touch another aspect of Atal ji's vast personality today and this Atal ji, who tried to make changes in the political culture, tried to move it into the structure of the system and due to which India has benefited very much and is going to be very beneficial in the coming days .
That ' s sure
India will always be grateful to Atalji for the 91st Amendment Act .
This change made two significant changes in Indian politics .
First , the size of the Cabinet in the States was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats .
Secondly, the limit fixed under the anti-party law was increased from one-third to two-thirds .
Along with this, clear guidelines were also set to disqualify the parties.
For many years the political culture of setting up a huge Cabinet in India was made not only for the division of large jambo cabinet but also to please politicians .
Atalji changed it .
Their move saved money and resources .
At the same time there was an increase in efficiency .
It was a long sight like Atal ji who changed the situation and healthy traditions in our political culture
Atalji was a true patriot .
During his tenure , there was a change in the presentation of the budget .
According to the tradition of the first British , the budget was presented at 5 o ' clock in the evening , because at that time there was time for the Parliament to begin in London .
In 2001 , Atalji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 o ' clock to 11 o ' clock in the morning .
"In the tenure of one and Independence Atal ji
The Indian flag code was created and it was authorized in 2002
Many such rules have been made in this code, which made it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places
More and more Indians got the opportunity to hoist their national flag .
Thus they brought our vital tricolor closer to the common man .
You saw it
How did Atal ji make basic reforms by taking bold steps in the country, whether the election process and the disorders related to the people's representatives
Likewise , nowadays , you are seeing that discussions are going on simultaneously in the country for conducting elections in the centre and the States
People are keeping their point in both sides and opposition of this subject .
This is a good thing and a good sign for democracy .
I will definitely say for healthy democracy, to develop good traditions for the best democracy, to constantly try to strengthen democracy, to move discussions with open mind, this will also be an excellent tribute to Atal ji
Reiterating his resolve to fulfill the dream of a rich and developed India , I pay tribute to Atalji on behalf of all of us .
My dear countrymen
Nowadays, when the discussion of Parliament happens, it is often about the interruption, the attack and the deadlock, but if something is good then its discussion is not so much
Monsoon session of Parliament ended just a few days ago .
You will be happy to know that the producity of the Lok Sabha is 118 and the Rajya Sabha has 74 .
Emerging above the party , all the MPs tried to make the monsoon session more useful and the result was that the Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and the Rajya Sabha passed 14 bills .
This monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and the welfare of youth .
Several important legislations to benefit young and backward communities were passed during this session .
You all know that for decades there was a demand for Bommission just like the SST Commission
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes , the country has fulfilled the resolution of the BCC this time and has given it a constitutional right .
This step will prove to be the goal of social justice .
To secure the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes , the amendment bill was also passed in this session .
This law will further secure the interests of the SC and ST community
At the same time , it will prevent the criminals from torturing and believe in the dalit communities .
No civil society can tolerate any injustice against the women ' s power of the country
The country is not ready to tolerate the culprits of rape, so Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and made provision of severe punishment
The culprits of misbehavior will be sentenced to at least 10 years, they will be punished for raping the girls under the age of 12
A few days ago , you must have read in newspapers in Mandsaur , Madhya Pradesh , after a two - month trial , a court has sentenced two rap convicts to death .
Earlier , in Katni , Madhya Pradesh , a court sentenced the guilty only after five days of hearing .
Rajasthan has also made such quick decisions by the courts there .
This law will play an effective role in preventing crime cases against women and girls
Economic progress is incomplete without social change
Triple Divorce Bill passed in Lok Sabha
However , this session of Rajya Sabha has not been possible
I assure Muslim women that the whole country stands with full force to get justice for them .
When we move forward in the country, changes can be brought in the lives of poor, backward, exploited and deprived
In the monsoon session this time everyone has presented an ideal .
I publicly thank all the MPs of the country today
My dear countrymen
These days the attention of millions of people is on the Asian Games in Jakarta .
Every day in the morning people first look at newspapers, television, news, social media and see which Indian player has won medal
Asian games are still running
I want to congratulate all the players who win medal for the country
I also have a lot of good wishes to those players, whose competitions are still there
India's players are performing excellently especially in Shooting and Restling, but our players are also bringing medals in those games, in which our performance has not been so good, such as 'Ushu and Rowing' - These are not just medals - proofs - Indian sports and players touch the sky of courage and dreams
Among those who win medal for the country , our daughters are included and this is a very positive sign - even among the young players who win medal we have 15 - 16 years of age .
It is also a very good sign that most of the players who have won medal are residents of small towns and villages and they have earned this success with hard work .
On August 29, we will celebrate the "National Sports Day" on this occasion, I wish all the sports lovers, as well as pay tribute to Hockey's magician great player Shri Dhyanchand ji.
I request all the citizens of the country to play and take care of their own fitness because healthy India will build a rich and rich India
When ID
India ' s bright future will be created only when Endia it will be created
Once again , I congratulate medal winners in Asian Games and wish the rest of the players a good performance .
Best wishes to all of them for National Sports Day too .
"Prime Minister Jee Namaskar"
I am talking about an engineering student from Kanpur .
In the last mind of the Prime Minister, you talked to students students going to college, and before that you talked to doctors, charted accountants
I have a prayer to you that in the celebration of the coming 15th September which is celebrated as an engineers Day, if you talk to students of engineering like us, which will increase our morale and we will be very happy and we will also get encouragement to do something for our country in the coming days, thanks
Great feeling, I respect your feelings
We all have seen building houses and bricks with brick stones, but can you imagine that almost twelve years ago a huge mountain which was just a single stone mountain was given the form of a fine, huge and wonderful temple - maybe it was difficult to imagine, but it happened and it is the temple - Kailashnath temple located in Ellora of Maharashtra
If someone tells you that about a thousand years ago a column of granite was built over 60 meters and a rock of 80 tons of granite was placed on its summit , would you believe
But, the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this unbelievable mail of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patan of Gujarat .
India ' s Land Engineering Laboratory
There are many engineers in India who made unimaginable and presented examples called miracles in the world of engineering
We also got a gem in our heritage of great engineers, whose work is still amazing people and he was Bharat Ratna Dr. M. Vishwaswaraya (r. M. Shiveshwaraya)
Even today lakhs of farmers and people are benefitted from the Krishnaraja Sagar dam built on the Kaveri river .
In that part of the country it is worshipable, the rest of the country also remembers them with very respect and intimacy
In his memory , fifteenth September is made as ngineers Day
Our country ' s engineers have made their identities all over the world , following their footprints .
When I talk about the miracles of the world of engineering, then I remember an incident of a terrible earthquake that had occurred in Kutch in 2001 today
At that time I used to work as a volunteer there, I got an opportunity to go to a village and there I got an opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years and she was ridiculing us to see me, and she was saying, "It is my house - I will call him Bhung in Kutch " said, this house has seen 3-3 earthquakes"
I have seen three earthquakes myself
See you in this house
But you didn ' t see any harm anywhere
According to the nature of our ancestors this house was built according to the environment here and this thing was saying so proudly then I came to think that even centuries ago the engineers of that period had constructed according to the local conditions that due to which the common people were safe .
Now when we celebrate the nignees Day , we should also think about the future
Workshops should be done at places .
What new things do we have to learn in the changed age
Do you have to teach
Do you have to add
Nowadays disastr management has become a very big job
The world is struggling with natural disasters
What is the new form of structural enginering
What are its courses
What should be taught students
How is Construction Construction Deco-friendly
How to construction of local materials vally addition and forward
How did it become our priority
We must think of many such things when Engineers celebrate ay
My dear countrymen
There is an atmosphere of festivals and along with the preparation of Diwali begins .
"We will continue to meet the mind, talk about the mind and we will continue to mobilize in furthering the country with our mind"
With this one feeling very good to all of you
Thank you
Then we ' ll meet
.
