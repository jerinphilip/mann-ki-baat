Prime Minister Mr.
Nadramodi, on the 20th of September 2016, at 11 a.m., the Tamilnadu language of the special launch conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population.
My favourite patriots say you're grateful to them.
We lost 18 heroes from our country in a terrorist attack on Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir in the past.
I finish these heroes and pay attention to them.
This terrible incident was enough to capture the whole country.
There are sorrows and sorrows in the country.
This loss is not only the lost son, the lost brother, the lost husband's family.
This loss is all over the country.
So I would like to repeat my countrymen, and the culprits in that event will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
They fail all this kind of ethics through their nerves.
They will be prepared for the greatest struggle to live peacefully and comfortable hundred and fifty people in the country.
We're in our army.
There's a lot of opportunities to speak to the people and politicians.
We'll talk.
But the army won't speak.
The army is showing their heads.
Today wants to speak specially to the people of Kashmir.
The people of Kashmir have begun to understand the treason powers.
As the truth emerges, they start walking through the path of peace from themselves.
All parents want all schools and colleges to work fully.
The peasants want to get their crops, fruits, etc. to the routines of India.
I mean, the economic business wants to be right.
In the last few days, business has started to work properly.
We all know that peace and significance and harmony are the path of peace, our progress, the path of development.
For our future generation, we have to raise the new heights of the evolution.
I believe we'll find peace together for all the problems, and the future generation of Kashmir will prove the right path.
The security of the people of Kashmir is the responsibility of the Regime.
The administration will have to take some action to carry out the law and order.
Our powers and laws are used for comfort, and the common people of Kashmir are for peaceful and calm lives, and I want to tell the security forces to follow our security forces properly.
Sometimes the people who think differently than thinking make new suggestions.
I've got a lot of opportunities from social media in the next few days.
From all the corners of India, people of all kinds get the opportunity to understand and understand the emotions, which promotes the power of democracy.
Last day, a child named Harshavardhan in Eleventh Class presented a different concern in front of me.
He wrote, I felt sorry after Uri's terrorist attack.
I wanted to do something.
But I don't understand what to do.
What a little student can do like me.
I thought I could be helpful to the good of the country.
I decided to learn more than three hours a day.
I'm sure the country's beneficial.
My dear Harshavardha, I'm glad to think about the child at this young age in this rough atmosphere.
But I'll tell you, son, the country's mind is worthy of anger.
It's a symbol of nation's consciousness.
There's an enraged vision to do something.
Yes, the child presented it with a visual vision.
But when the war took place in 1965, we were given the leadership of Lal Bahadur Scientist.
And the country had an excitement, there was anger, there was a humiliation of patriotism.
Everyone wanted to do something, thinking of doing something.
Lall Bahadur Scientist worked very well to touch this vitality of the country.
He inspired Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan to work for the country's ordinary people.
Lall Bahadur Scientist showed another way to show patriotism between bombs and guns.
Mahatma Gandhi and Mahatma Gandhi, while fighting for freedom, when the movement takes place, if they want a step ahead of the Sammelan, it was a very effective way to bring that force back to creative things in the society.
Let us and the army make their own responsibility, the rulers make their work, if we make any creative part with the enthusiasm of this patriotism, then the nation will surely win new heights.
Dear countrymen, Mr.
T.
S.
I wrote Carthik Narendramodi App, the articles that went to Paralibicks recorded history, their performance was the victory of human spirit, Human spirit.
Mr.
Varun wrote in Vishwanath and Narendramodi app, and gained our items.
You have to tell me about it in your mind, Keeba.
Not only both of you, but all the kingdoms in Paralimicks have communicated a discrepancy with our players.
Perhaps more than the game Paraolibiques and the benefits of our sports and the vision of human vision, Divine.
I don't forget the words of our successive sister Deepa Malik.
When the medal was obtained, the sister said, I defeated the disability through this medal.
There's a lot of power in this word.
This time in Para Olympics, 19 women from our country participated.
In comparison to other sports, more than physical ability in the games of Divya, more than the nipunya of the game, it's the will and determination.
You wonder if our sportsmen have achieved 4 medals with the greatest achievement in the past, two gold, one silver and one silver, and the second gold medal in Volt 12 years later.
It's been 12 years old.
Once gold is obtained, the zeal decreases, but Devendra demonstrates the condition of the body, the age of his decisiveness, never contemplated.
That's the medal again after 12 years.
He wasn't a man of birth.
He was losing his hand because of electrical damage.
Think about how big the gold medal would have been obtained when a man got gold medal at the age of twenty-thirds again at the age of thirty-three.
Maryappan gained gold medal in Thankwellu highway.
Thankwellu lost his right in five years.
And poverty did not interfere with his vision.
He's not a man living in a big city, not a middle class family.
Though struggling to lead a life full of hardships, physical hardships have gained medals for the country through suspense.
If it's Light Deepamali, it's rocked many victorious flags.
Varun C.
Venkala Medal was obtained at Bhati hygiene.
The medals in Paraolibiques have their own importance.
It is important that in our country, in our society, we are inspired to look at the divine brothers who live in our neighborhood.
Awake our compassion, and change our vision of this Divine.
Lots of people know how much performance this time in Paralibiques.
A few days ago the Olympics competitions were held at the same place.
Anybody thinks that even the Recadue of the General Olympics was altered.
This time it happened.
Algeria's absurdity Baca 1 in the competition of Racad Divyaga, established in the Olympics competition at 1500 meters.
Seven seconds for a while, a new record was set up at 1500 meters.
Not only this, I was surprised that the man who didn't get the medal, who ran away from the golden people of the common Olympics for some time.
I once again congratulate these players.
In the coming days, India is trying to make a facilitator for Para Olympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a very amazing experience in the Navasari of Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
The Indian government organized a large camp of Divya.
A lot of records were established that day.
There's a small boy who can't see the world from the unprecedented forest of Dang district, telling Gary Sardhu without seeing the whole night.
Some portions have heard me.
That's what I told the people who were there.
People were surprised.
That's when I got a chance to publish a book.
It contains Vijayagathas of the life of some Divyas.
There were events of great enthusiasm.
I believe that the world's record was established in the soil of the Indian government, Newsari.
Within eight hours, half a dozen divine people could make machines for those who couldn't hear.
It's got a place in Ginnas book of World Records.
It's a pride for us to set up three world records in a day.
My dear patriots, two years ago, the priest of October 2 started the purifying India's birth anniversary.
When I told you that the environment was hateful to all the people and to become dragons of our nature, I'd be sure that when October is two years old, the country's hundred and fifty-five people are awake in the mind of purifying.
I told you, it's a red purifier.
Well, we're gonna say we're all trying to move one step ahead.
It means the country has stepped up hundreds of five folds in accuracy.
I'm sure what's going on in the right direction and how good the consequence is, and what's happening through some effort.
That's why all the common people, even the ruler, even the government officials.
Although the road, the bus stand, the school or the college or the religious establishment, but the hospital, from the children to the old, the poor villages and the poor and the peasant women all participate in the matter of selfishness.
Friends of the media also participated.
I think we're gonna move too far.
But the beginning was good, tried very hard, we believed we'd be successful.
According to rural India, two folds have been built forty-five lakhs, which means about two and a half kilograms.
I mean to build more than one and a half centuries in the coming year.
In order to describe the health, the glory of the mountains, especially in the open space of the mothers and sisters.
So the Open Defectation Free (ODF) has started the birthplace of the open space.
Healthy competition is going on in villages with districts and states.
States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will win the path of salvation without much delay.
When I went to Gujarat now, the officials said that the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi will be fully ODF for October 2.
I appreciate those who have done this.
Those who try to achieve this goal are funny.
I'm supposed to protect the country from this problem for the health of the younger children to be respected by the mothers and sisters.
Come on, let's move with sight.
Especially in the next few days, I would like to present a plan in front of young friends who used technologies.
What's peace in your city about selfishness.
Everyone has the right to know that the Indians have given a number: 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
We celebrated the birth centenary of Mahatma Gandhi in 1969.
In 2019, we are going to celebrate the 150th victory of Mahatma Gandhi.
If you call on this 1969, you can understand the status of the construction of the chamber, not the request to make the chamber.
You're gonna make it profit.
Not only this, the complaints related to self-confidence have begun to know about the remedy of the complaints.
You use it the best, especially the new generation.
Indians have requested the corporation to move forward from the world.
Sponsor young professionals who want to work for selfishness.
They can be sent to the districts by self-sufficient fello.
It doesn't matter if purifying the rituals.
It's not purity.
In today's age, health is related to purifying.
Likewise, purifying is a propaganda model.
The dirt must be part of the wealth.
So, with the purifying mission, we must turn to the West To Compost.
The culture of Kharmalians must be done.
We have to work to change as a compost, so there has been a political interference from the territory.
The Fertilizer has told companies to buy composts made from dirt.
The farmers who want to turn to the Organic family have to provide it.
Those who want the health of their own soil, who are concerned about the health of the earth, who have suffered the harm of chemicals, should be given such a size if necessary.
Mr.
Amimabh Bachanji is taking part in this as brand Ambassider.
I invite young people to new startups in the West Towelth Plan.
Develop such equipment, develop its technology, work in a very small way to generate it.
It's a thing to do.
There's a lot of job opportunities.
There are possibilities of economic dealings.
We can win money from dirt.
This year, a special program is being organized by Indosan, Indian Sanitation Conferencing from September 25 to October 2.
Ministers from the country, Chief Ministers, Mayors from the Mahanagars, the Communists are going to conduct a deep discussion about purifying everything.
What can be done with technology
Financial modal, how can the Janpagand be.
How to provide jobs through this.
There will be discussions on topics like that.
I've seen new news about selfishness.
I had come to the newspaper on the next day that the students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages to create awareness about the construction of the school.
In order to create nineteen thousand schools, they served their supremacy.
Wing Commander Parmvir Singh's introduction has sent a message of self-confidence while traveling 2800 kms from Devprayag to Gangasagar.
Each department of the Government of India has prepared a timetable for one year.
All the departments will concentrate specially for 15 days.
In this coming October, the Department of Drinking Water, Rural Development, Panchayatiraj is going to work together to formulate a framework on their area from 1st date to 15th.
For the last two weeks of October, from 16th to 31st of December, three departments like the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Cultural, Consultancy, etc. are going to undertake dirty manufacturing in the area related to 15 days.
I'm supposed to ask the people not to interfere in these departmental operations.
There's a surveillance surveillance.
First of all, 73 cities were served and presented in front of people.
Now there's 500 rounds of cities with more than a million population.
This way we're behind, next time we have a confidence to do something better in every city.
There's a competitive surveillance.
I hope all the people share as much as they can.
This is the birthday of October 2, Mahatmagandhi and Lall Bahadur Scientist.
It's been two years since the self-sufficiency started.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepawali, he wants to buy something of Khadi.
I want to buy a cloth of khadi in every family this time.
Through this, the lamp of Deepawali will be found at the house of the poor.
This is October 2, Sunday.
Can't you help yourself to remove the dirt as a genius that day
2 hours, 4 hours straight into it.
I share the picture of that participant in the Narendramodi app, if it's video, share it.
Look, the country will get a chance for this movement as a result of our efforts.
In the memory of Mahatmagandhi and Lal Bahadurist, we can make a decision to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen have a special pleasure to give them in life.
The joy of giving it anybody accepts it or not is amazing.
In the past, when I told you to leave the gas subsidies, our people responded very convincingly to it is a very inspiring event in the country's life.
Young people in our country, some mine.
J.
O.
Joe of Giving Wheel is going to celebrate in many cities from October 2 to 8.
It's the move to bring food and clothes to the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, our fellow men went to the street and prayed for ancient toys at home.
The toys that were found were distributed to the bodyguards of the poor street.
The happiest of those poor boyfriends to see the toys is a word.
In the Joe of Gueving Wheel, this coming to the city, encourage the enthusiasm of these youths, help them.
In a way, it's a dance festival.
I'm grateful to the young men involved in this.
Dear countrymen, today is September 25.
Pandit Dinada is the birth anniversary of the Deputy Director.
His birth centenary is starting from today.
He showed that millions of businessmen like me were acting on any thoughtful basis.
From the side of the princess who knew India's soul, he gave a princely pilgrimage to think of India's cultural heritage.
That's the solitary destination.
The percentage of the sub-division begins today.
Her contribution to the international principle, the universal-service.
Mahatmagandhi used to say the welfare of the last person standing at the end.
How poor people can get the quality of development in poverty.
He presented financial programmes with words like work and water in all the fields of agriculture.
The country will celebrate his birth centenary for a poor year.
Let the poor concentrate on how to get the benefits of the development of the society, the government's attention.
Then we're gonna get rid of the country's poverty.
The prime minister's destiny was known by the name of the Race Course Road since the time of the British.
Considering the birth centenary of the Pandit Dinada, the Prime Minister's destiny has been named Lok Kalyan Marg.
It's a symbolic form of poverty welfare.
All of us were inspiration, honorable Pandit Dinada, rich with our adventurous heritage, enjoys me with respect.
My dear countrymen, I started Man Kee Bath two years ago on the day of Vijay Dashami.
This triumph will be completed for two years.
I've tried myself not to be a program that was done by Man Kee Bath government.
Don't be a program of accusations and accusations of the princely handicapped mankiebat.
In this period of two years, there were many types of pressures and sometimes there were immense obsessions of the mind, sometimes there was a pressure to inspire you to say something unworthy, but all your assimilation caused you to stop Manki Bath from them and try to connect with ordinary people.
How the ordinary man in this country is inspiration for me.
What are the expectations and expectations of the common man in this country.
Whatever form of ordinary person in my mind and brain is clearly visible in Man Key Bay.
The people of the country can have a chance to know Manki Bath, so far as I feel, Manki Bath feels the strength of my hundred and twenty-five people, recalling the capacity of hundred and twenty-five people in my country, and there is a program to inspire to work.
In this two-year-old humor, Man Kee Bath, who helped you to comfort, enjoy the gratitude of all the rituals to steal the blessings.
My words are not only broadcasting, but also gratitude in the sky to reach all languages.
After hearing Man Kee Bath, he wrote letters, suggested, sworn in the gate of the gate, enlightened the deficiencies of the revolution.
The sky has organized special programs on such letters, calling the revolutionary representatives, making solutions to the problems.
I mean Man Kee Bath didn't agree 15-20 minutes ago, there was a new chance of social change.
Anybody's got something more pleasant than that.
So let's make gratitude clear to everyone to make it successful, thank you.
My dear patriots celebrate next week Navaratri and Durga Puja and Vijay Dashami.
At the same time, the preparations for Deepavali will create a different environment.
It's the celebration of Shakti Upasana.
The unity of society is the power of the country.
Even though Durga Puja is Navaratri, how can the unity of this powerful society be celebrated
How people celebrate each other.
That's the real power.
Then we're gonna have to celebrate the victory together.
Come on, let's worship the power.
Let's move with the icon.
Peace and significance can be celebrated by the new night and Durga Puja to bring the nation to higher altitude, the victory of Vijaydashami.
Thank you very much.
