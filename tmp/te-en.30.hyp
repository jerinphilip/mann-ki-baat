On August 28, 2016 in Akashwani, Minister of State, Shri Narendra Modi, "Man Ki Bath" (Speak in Mansu) is the fullest favourite of my country Prajalara Namaskar.
August 29, tomorrow.
Hockey magician Dhyan Chand Jayanti.
This date will be celebrated as the national sports of the Yawat country.
I wish to pay tribute to Dhyan Chandaji, this evening I would like to remind you of the services made to the country of Dhyan Chand.
In 1982, in 1932, in the Olympic sports of 1936, he played a charming role in achieving the golden heritage of a heavy country.
All cricket lovers know about Broad Man.
It is said about Dhyan Chand that ' Dhyan Chand golfs ' like a run .
Sports spontaneously, the country's Bhaktiki Dhyan Chand has stood a life-threatening gesture.
Once in a match in Koll Kata, Dhyan Chand kicked with hockey sticks on the floor.
Then there's more than one Nimisha left to complete the match.
Dhyan Chand did three golds for that second minute.
Dhyan Chand said that I've finished the wound as Golds.
Dear Prajalara of my country.
My yellow when 'Man Ki Bath' is ready.
In or through the Narendra Mody App, many people are giving instructions.
All these are very different.
But this time many people sent me instructions to talk quietly about Rio Olympics.
I felt so enjoyed to see such a love of Riyao Olympics for the common man.
Talk to the proposal minister Rio Olympics, and I feel positive about the pressure from the public.
Besides cricket, I'm very fond of seeing love, desperate, obsessions of those who are on the other side of the game.
In fact, to give me this message this day, you're insane to inspire me.
On the Narandra Mody App, Ajit Singh said, "This time, in Man Ki Bath, girls have been talking about their involvement in the game.
In Rio Olympics, the girls who won the television were told about the country's guerrilla.
Mother's suckin, what he's doing.
This time, in the 'Man Ki Bath', I said, replieve the Sindh, witness, Deepa Karmakar.
It's just this girl who was the queen of the Mann country.
Girls have defined the evermore.
If one of the girls who have won the legs, they're from the country's weight of the country, they're in charge.
Something else belongs to the eastern country.
Somebody's weight is from somewhere in the country.
Looking at this, girls all enable the country to elevate the ability to enhance the best of all.
Mygov.
Shikhar Takur said that those who were roaming back in Olympics on the website.
And "Gaurvani Moody" was the pursuits to win footsteps in Rio.
But.
Don't really be good at the mind.
I mean.
Don't say that.
There is a need to do more easily in the field of sports.
Now the nuts say they're paying attention only to the poor.
I think playing games are supposed to make communicable.
There's so much to change this imagination.
It's supposed to have a new inspiration.
You're supposed to be sweet and sweet.
While introducing Satyaprakash Mehra on the Narandra Mody App, there is a need to take care of the university functioning.
Especially for the kids, the youngsters want to increase the risk of sports.
Almost thousands of people have suggested these things.
I don't expect the mind to be hungry.
I don't have a fucking fucking fucking shit.
Not only that, some sportsmen didn't even show the nationally dedicated level in Rio.
On seeing these days, two came to Man.
But if you really don't think it's coming back.
In many matters, Man Bharatia players first showed a very wonderful game shore.
In the shooting, Abhinav Bindra was ranked fourth.
A little bit of difference has lost the pawn.
Deepa Karmakar wondered in Gymnastics, she stood at four.
The turtle went slightly shrinking.
Stop the first heavily supposed to be able to get Olympics Finnals.
Similarly, in Tennis, the Jody of Sania Mirza, Rohn Bopnn has lost a little difference.
I gave good prayers this time in athletics.
After 32 years, P.
T.
Ush Taruwat, Lilita has been able to track and field the finals.
Besides, it's a funny enjoyment to gain place in the 36-year-old Mohila Hockey Team Olympics.
In the same way, reaching Nakot Dash Dasa Daka, the 36-year-old men, Hockey Jatt, is also the cause of Garava.
Man Jatt is very pretty good.
It's surprising that Argentina's who won the golden ritual in Hockey was shot once in this Olympics.
I just saw that ship in my own hands.
The future is hard.
In the boxing, Vicas Krishna Yadav uarter's finals went to Daka.
But, Kanya couldn't get the address.
How many people like that
For Uday Rana, Atti Asoka, Datu Boknell, Atunu Das.
Their names can be referended to such a good prayer.
Dear Prajalara of my country.
There's too much to be drunk.
If you're doing the job right now, I'm gonna be in despair.
I'm supposed to make a committee.
Depth of the country's vitality, follows it, teaches it.
Make sure what the hell's going to do is put the roadside for it.
In 2020, 2024, 2028, the republic has to be set up to go ahead with a distance.
I'm also reminding the state's princes.
You set up such committees on the site.
Think of what you want to do in the game.
I don't want to do the state of nature.
Prati kingdom is one of the other sports and can prove the ball.
I'm asking all the meetings related to the sports, I'm supposed to possess the Mathemathan.
The pretended Prajalandarini also recalls sending their imaginations to the Narendra Mody App.
I'm asking the states to send their suggestions to the diamonds, as well as to the playing components.
Make sure you're supposed to.
125 crores of Janabha, in which 65 percent of the youngsters of India, I have a humorous greeting in the world.
Go ahead with this shithead.
Dear Prajalara of my country.
September 5 teachers.
I've come very close to the students like a student of the teacher's dinosaurs.
I came to learn how much from those little kids.
I don't think I'm supposed to be a 5-year-old teacher.
My educational destination.
But this time G-20 has to go to the camp.
That's why I had to talk about those things in this 'Man Ki Bath'.
That's how much teacher's role is in life.
We'll see a lot of people who love more than our students.
They mark their lives for their students.
Now seeing Rio Olympics as a flame, the leopard's name is Gopichand.
He's a player.
But, as the best teacher, he's been standing as an admirer.
This day I look at Gopichand as a player, an excellent teacher.
The teacher's pride is enjoying him to enjoy him on the sports of Gopichand's sweet sports, students' vijayas.
He's always remembering the role of a teacher in his life.
Settember 5 former state patriarchy Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan dynasty.
It's the country's teacher's gonna roam.
Sometimes he thought he was a teacher who hurled so many people.
Lived like that.
They always used to say that.
In a teacher, whenever the student hids, he's a good teacher.
Radhakrishnan, the prince who lived his life, as a teacher of the kingdom, as a teacher.
I'm remembering my teachers.
They're my stories in that little palletur.
In the 90th century, our guru was sworn.
They're coming up to me in the month of Prati.
I've been supposed to be crazy for the old man.
They're talking about books in that month in Prati Uttar.
They're propagating Cotechn.
That book.
I didn't like it, yes.
Why didn't you, or why didn't you say they're coming up.
If that shit slips, he's talking to me in front of the classroom and telling me the stature.
In fact, I still feel like the one who's growing my knowledge by the Corespandence Corce.
I'm surprised to see the 90-hour hand roll.
That's a beautiful sword.
There's no ruin in hand in this wire.
My hand is not good.
That's why I'm very enjoyed to see the beautiful hand rock.
They're gonna enhance the ghost.
Somehow my feelings are like you.
Your teachers will do so much better for your life.
Tell the whole thing about it.
In this ceremony, the guerrilla grows towards the teachers.
The vision to see them changes in the angle.
Increasing the teacher's guerrilla in the ceremony is his duty.
Like your teachers descended photo, join the Narendra Mody App as the inspirational groups of those teachers.
It is also important to see the role of teachers in the country from the student.
Dear Prajalara of my country.
In a few days, Ganesh's excitement is going on.
Ganesh is the god of whispering the wounds.
Mr. Sundarmu, the countryman, Man Samjaniki, the Man family, and the best of Man...
.
The life of the person who wants to be uninterrupted.
Cabbitty is now talking about Ganesh's production.
It's comfortable to memorize the Lok Manya Tilak as soon as the Ganesh was born.
Communist Ganesh Utswad's communion Lok Manya Bal Gangadhar Tilak started.
Community Ganesh has converted a religious organism to a festival to enhance the nation.
In the ceremony it was transformed in the following processes.
Make extensive discussions on all the substances of social life by collective gangsters.
Make this activity a new supplies for the samaj, giving all the excitement.
Along with this excitement, he added the message of 'Swattatram Ma Janma Hakku'.
This version must be the center of action.
THE THE THE SHOUGHT THE FOR THATING OF THE SHATTIONG.
Now there is no pill in one Maharashtra, there are all kinds of collective genes in the country.
Young people are enjoying many kinds of work to determine this activity.
Some people don't negotiate this excitement with the feelings of Lock Maanya Bal Gangadhar Tellak, that's the way they're still working to determine.
They're supposed to demonstrate spectacles on social matters.
They're competing in business.
Rangoli was contesting.
In these coloroli shapes, socio-social elements are reflected.
They're very magically exhibiting the comrades of the jetty.
To say in a way, social education gardens have become a medium of genesis.
"Swaattrum gave a motivational magic to our janma hakku."
Now the man is in the country of self-reliance.
Now we have to get our janma hacked, the magic, the survivors of the collective gangster.
Move before the mind towards the spirit.
Deliberate must be the face.
Now it's not possible to give a message to the sensible mantra to the human community, Ganesh Utswa.
Come on.
I'm invited to you.
Switch forward towards survival.
The power of any excitement.
Individuals, in celebration, new sweats in life.
Festival is uncomfortable.
But, like Samya, you have to imagine my life.
This time many people sent me a lot of toxics like Ganesh festivals, Durga Puja.
In their words, there was a problem everywhere.
Modhiji, Shanker Narayan Prashant asked for the release of the people who were used by the Plaster of Paris in Manki Bath.
Why don't you use the wrath of the pond soil .
Think about it.
Plaster of Paris hurts the environment, so much pain has been disappeared.
They're gonna have their troubles too.
I'm also listening to your beauty.
Ganeshhudi Virghahals, Durga Mata Pratimas, Mana Puratana communications are the creation of soil gardens and the ponds, the rivers haven't destroyed everything.
The small worms that live in the water ruined by water pollution.
To save all the creatures, the service of Kada Bhaga.
That's the destructor, the power to wrap the wounds.
Don't change the rebels of the mind.
I don't know how these things you're talking about.
I'm not, many people say this thing.
I also heard so many things said.
Abhijit Gondre Fale, Dhyan Prabodani, Nisarg Mitr of Kolhapur, Science Prophetry of Vidarbha, Nisarg Katta of Vidarbha, King of Girgaon Cha, Tadithar of Mumbai, many organizations, organizations, disappointments, etc. are propagating the ruins of the furnace.
The favourite Ganesh utensils for the festival are part of the samaj serving.
There's more time for Durga Puja.
Don't fix the mind right now.
The ancient context of the mind makes the muds of soil.
They're gonna find the way they depend on that profession.
The festival also runs round.
Ganesh Chaturthi is the pursuit of your best.
Dear Prajalara of my country.
On September 4, Ratna Mother Teresa is conveying the title of Saint.
Mother Teresa has enjoyed the immense life of the poor country.
She was born country Albania.
She's not Matri language English.
Yet she made her life happy for the service of the public.
He worked immortally to serve the poor.
She spent her lifelong lives in the service of her weights.
That's what Mr. Teresa's got the title of Saint.
Enjoying a lot of survivors.
On September 4, 125 crores of this activity goes to the headquarters of an authority representative team in the leadership of the Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj.
I'm learning a little bit by the priests, dresses, saints.
I'm so sure I'm supposed to be suffering.
I'm just doing so much better.
Dear Prajalara of my country.
Look how many changes come when it turns into a prayer garden.
The power of the people is the shape.
For the Ganges constructed with the compassion of five states, the Bharata Prabhu a few years ago, the Ganges also tried to swamp the parts of the Ganges.
On 20th of this month, on the banks of the Ganges in Allahabad, when they were invited to the work of Srikara, the eldest prophecy of the shores.
They're women, men and women.
They rolled up the Ganges and witnessed them, in their villages, they slaughtered the attempt to destroy it.
In Prati village, it is said that the construction of the barbers was done in the street.
One of those who came to Allahabad is Uttarakhand, others are Uttarpradesh.
Another sword of Bihar.
And there are also people from Yar Khand, the West Bengal.
I'm telling you all this gratitude.
I'm preferring the salutations.
For all the departmental departments of the weight of the Lord, my salutations to the jackals.
It's a pleasure to make the Ganges unpleasant.
I'm thanking the chief ministers of five states.
Thank you for slaughtering them into this magic activity by suppressing Prajashakti.
I love my country...
Sometimes some things are touching my mind.
Those feelings refer to Gaurav on their sides.
On July 15, Lakha Old Classes of about 1700 Pathshalas in the Kabir Dham district of Chhattisgarh have confessed their maternal grandsons.
When one comes to English, Mother wrote in Hindi.
Another was born in the Chhitisgarh Mandelli.
All of these kids want to get married in their homes in the ashes written to their mother-in-law.
Strikes to build dwarfs.
Some students didn't want to jerk on the birthday this time, but they wanted to kick the fuck off.
These students, who were 17 of the 7th slaves, weren't slaughtered.
Its nature is so much that when you go to the puppet on the other day of the furnace, the kids put a skin on the hands of the children.
They wanted to give it to the teachers.
We're having a promise to kill a bitch on the day of Flana in that fucking shit.
Not only those who imagined such a thought, but I also appreciate the sweet guys.
Students are seriously grateful to the parents who took the decision to build the dwellings.
It's gonna smell like this.
Inspiration.
Koppal district of Karnataka.
17 kids in this district.
In the beginning, she planted on the family for sacrifice.
It's also meant to eat.
She wanted good clothes for her, instead of wanting sweets, she'd fasten in her house.
But.
She doesn't have the financial resources to get married to her family.
But, it's Sasemira to seduce the males.
That's why the big Mahmad Shaffey of that village commemorated 18,000 rupees.
A couple of days have been arranged.
Like a village like a male, shepherd, it's really true with great adventure.
I'm sorry to know if you open the doors for the men's rituals.
I love my country...
Clean weight of nature, some have become nervous.
Some people turned it into sympathy.
Prati is part of this garden somehow
New new efforts are being done.
The weight of the Lord came a temptation.
You're working for cleanliness... in three minutes in two nimishas... painting it, send it to the Centre.
In the website, it's all related to it.
Let's define it as a competition.
October 2 for those who won this competition.
Gandhi's jurisdiction day.
I'll give you the bullshit.
I'm also listening to the TV channels.
You're also cleaned up and sent a few pictures.
It gives immense inspiration to the clean weight garden .
New reputations are available.
All these parts of the public are possible with the general artists.
There's no big studio, bigger cameras for them.
Come on, move ahead.
This is my invitation to your beautiful ones.
My favorite country, Prajalara...
I've been working to enjoy good relations with the neighborhood countries.
A few days ago, there was a campaign.
Pranab Mukherji, the kingdom of Man Gauravana, surrounded a new work in Kol Kata.
It's the sky-world maternal channel.
This is what many people do.
A radio channel may look like a state-level caravan.
But, it's not normal radio channel.
That's a big funny.
Bangladesh is on the farm.
Man knows.
Bangladesh, the West Bengal, belongs to the same kind of culture and propaganda.
It's the sky-world mate.
Wireless Bangladesh on that side.
Those two perspectives are supposed to be poisonous.
They speak the Bangla language around.
The sky can be enjoyed.
The sky makes it so foolish to celebrate the relationship between the people.
That's why.
The kingdom itself started the maternal channel.
I'm telling you the gratitude of Bangladesh standing in this pen.
I'm also grateful to the audience friends who are part of the foreign business system.
Dear Prajalara of my country.
You handed me the Minister of the Promise.
True, but I'm a man too.
Sometimes the heart is smelling, the conflicts of the heart are growing.
They finish new power, inspiration in me.
My heavy country's public is supposed to do something.
A few days ago, I got a spark.
It touched my heart.
A trick of about 84.
She's a relaxed teacher.
It's the cornerstone she sent.
When the name of his name was published, Marimary was in that letter.
But.
I tell her her name.
I want to talk to you.
When you asked him to sacrifice Gas Subsidy in his head, I'd leave Subsidy.
That thing was completely forgotten that motherfucker.
But, a few days ago, I gave you a letter to your tarfun.
That's the letter sent by the gratitude to stop Gas Subsidy.
The answer was sent to the minister.
It's not much better than the Padma Shri award.
That rest teacher shared his feelings in the north.
Love my country, Prajalara.
GASS SUBSIDY'S WORKING WORKING AND WORKING OF THE WORKING.
My motherfucker, one of myself, by looking at those tricks, makes them beautiful.
It's like that.
Javababe's mother-in-law's letter for the beautiful excitement.
"You're doing a very good job.
The cattle smoke is freed from the smoke.
I'm a relaxed teacher.
In a few days I'll have 90 shields.
I'm sending you 50,000 rupees quietly.
It was wondering if you were trying to get rid of the smoke of the fucking monks.
It's retire.
A maternal priest who drives life with a pencil, sent 50,000 rupees to give Gas Connectron to his tailed Sodrimans.
The main thing is that is not the naked pill, she's not supposed to think, emotions, to rest for the houses.
They moved me.
Thank you for those retard teachers.
The future of this country is the blessings of millions of sodreams.
BALMU, DARYAMU, MAN DEARCE.
She didn't even send me that excuse to the Ministry of Protector.
Normally excited.
"Modi Bhaya" was born.
My namaskaras for shouting.
In the country, such mothers are telling my hundreds to be beautiful.
They're embarrassing their own sufferings, sufficiently comforting others.
My country Prajala...
Because of the last year's unfortunately there was a lot of trouble.
But the month of August stretched the mind in the years.
In some places of the country, there are many bulls.
The state government, the central government, the local corporations, the cleaning corporations, the social corporations and the public have worked to communicate their power from the public.
But there have been reports of the news of these hardships that gave me more messages.
Take a look at them.
So much of the time you've lived.
Calcie.
Please do it.
It's marvellous.
The next August month of Chirsmurnium.
The parties of the princely different drives rolled up a palm in the parlment, served pun (GST) bills.
The role of all the royal parties has emerged to change the JST.
It's known how simple the work is completed when all the parties snatch.
And there's a bit more in Kashmir.
In the case of Kashmir's neighborhood, all the royal parties of the country have been slaughtered together, together.
That's Prapanchani, gave a message to the hunters.
On the streets of Kashmir, the people of Kashmir have distinguished their feelings.
I'm talking to all the parties in Kashmir.
It's so good.
There's a thing they're specific about the belief that they disappear.
I would like to say sort of words... to be the two original specimens.
Mannar's supposed to be one.
It's the opinion of 125 crores of people.
The surpunch in the village and the minister of the campaign.
Everyone thought it was the same.
If one died in Kashmir.
He was young, Jawan of Bhadratadla.
Everything's dead.
No one's lost in the mind.
This feeling is all over the country.
Amayka touched the kids of Kashmiri.
They're all fucking fucking calm down.
Sometimes.
They're gonna have to tell Sanjay to these kids.
I love my country...
The country of Man is very big.
It's linked to many distinctions.
These differences are the ones who are citizens, compassionate, vital, human beings.
Let's make a funny ballet for things that grow up.
This way the country will be able to reach the skull by creating a future of jewelry.
125 crores of my country is greeting me on the forces of the people.
Thanks to my best of yours.
