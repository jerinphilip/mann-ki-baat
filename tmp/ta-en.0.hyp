The voice of the mind, the folk of February 2019, the folks
My mind is dreaming today when the hole of the mind starts.
Ten days ago, Bharat Mama lost her brave descendants.
These warriors, 125 million folks, have lost their own materials to protect us.
For the folks to sleep quietly, our brave men used to dedicate themselves unless they know the night.
In the fierce attack of Bhulwama, after the sacrifice of our warriors, the hearts of the folk are wounded, wreaking anger.
There are colors that have come from the four sides regarding the pilgrims and their families.
The apprehensions and salvations that have occurred in my mind and in my mind against this argue attack are dreaming of all human powers of the world that believe in humanity.
Waiting for the Mother of India, dedicating your lives, I obey a lot of warriors in the country.
This is a decency, humiliating the root with the root of humidity, giving us a constant excitement, further strengthening our psychology.
We have to forget all the differences of opinion like liberalism, religiousism, territorialism, etc. in front of the country.
That's why our ends and conclusions against acuteness are going to be sure, hard, finished.
And sometimes our armed men are showing somebody's supremacy and compassion.
On the other hand, they have taken out their valuable ability to pacify peace, and in the same language as those who have been involved in the attack.
You can see how the attack took place within 100 hours.
Military personnel have been ensuring the artisans and their supporters and the verrod Kelly.
After the life of the virtuous army personnel, the words and sympathies expressed by their relatives through the publications have been enlarged and strengthened all over the country by consciousness.
Ramaniranjan, the father of Ratan Takur, who is a member of Bihar's Bhagalpur, has also expressed his inner treasure to us.
He says he'd send his second son to fight the enemy, and if he wanted you to get down in the field.
The wife of Prasanna Sahu, wife of Diagayi associated with Jagat Singhpur in Orissa, also celebrates her extraordinary illusion.
He promised that his only man would join the Central Border Security Force.
When Vijay Shoren, who was locked up with a foolish flag, reached the Kumla of Jharkhand, his son, Sule, would join me in the military.
It's the loyalty of this spindle today, every child of India's body, within the swing, enlarges the feeling of life.
The same life-threatening feelings can be seen in everybody's house as well as our heroes.
We're no valor, he's not lawful to his family.
It is the family of Vijaya Maurya of Deoria , the priest of Dilakaraji , or the adjoining of Koda , Diagai , Hemraj , the fate of every family of the devils , the nurture of the festival , is swallowed .
I'm gonna urge the young people to understand, know, understand and understand what these families are feelings, whatever levels are cleared.
I don't know what the patriotism is, decency, what is, we don't have to see the past rocks of history.
In front of our eyes, philosophically, visually clear, living examples, they stand higher than the mountains, the exciting factors for the future of the illuminating India, they themselves, they demonstrate our glory
My creatures and my folks...
Freedom has been finished for a long time, any war that we have to wait for memories, and that's waiting for a long time.
It's a natural thing to be the loyalty and enthusiasm of the folk.
In the NarendramodiApp, Mr. Ongar Shetty, a resident of the Karnataka State, has expressed her pleasure about the creation of a national war memorial.
It is also a matter of surprise that no national war memorial has been made in our country so far .
I wanted to be a memorable memorial decorated with the threats of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the country.
I'm sure a memorial must have been made in the country.
We decided to settle the National War Memorial
This memorial is very pleasant for me to be prepared in a short time .
That is, on the 25th day of the month of February, we will dedicate this national military memorial to hundreds of our countrymen and our military.
It's gonna be the smallest attempt to retrieve the debt that fell to the country, military.
Delhi's heart says it's india Gate, Amar Jawan Jodi.
Near that, this new memorial has been created.
I don't believe it's going to be a pilgrimage than a pilgrimage to the national military memorial.
The National Military Memorial, the composition of the warriors who suppressed after independence, regulates the reflection of the nation.
The scarcity of the memorial shows the unbelievable compassion of our jewelry.
The National Military Memorial is the center of four general circles that are four chakras.
The journey till Tyagam begins with the birth of a hero.
The flame of the Amar Chakra, symbolizes the immortality of the decent hero.
The second chamber, the symbol of the valor, shows the evil and the evil of the warriors.
In the walls of this philosophy the valorous activity of the warriors is engraved .
After that, Diagonal Chakra.
This chakra shows the sacrifices of the soldiers.
In this the names of warriors who have served for the country are engraved in golden scriptures .
After this, the Rakshakh Chakra symbolizes safety.
There is a sequence of dense trees in this chakra.
These trees regulate warriors, what do they know, as the citizens of the country relied
..
..
.
Every man in the border of the country is ready, so the people can feel safe.
If you look simultaneously, how can we identify the National Military Memorial, then there will be information regarding the importance of the devils of the country, to see our frustrations, and conduct the research of those rituals that people will come there
There are tales here about those who sacrificed their lives for the country.
The feeling that when we look at them, we live with emotions, live, we are safe, they sacrificed themselves on the development path of the country.
It's unlikely that our armed forces, armed forces, sub-military armed forces, serving in words, are the most important participants.
Last year in October , the National Heritage Memorial was found to be a great deal of dedication to the nation.
This memorial was also built in the outskirts of the feeling that we should be thankful in men and women who are engaged safely in all the time.
I'm sure you're gonna go to the national military memorial, and the national leadership.
Whenever you go to those places, you must take smokes there in the social network.
It would be interested in going to these sacred places by enjoying others.
My folks
Your thousands of letters and ideas for the cheeks of the mind come to me in different ways.
This way when I was studying your ideas, Adish Mukopathya attracted me a luxurious idea.
On the 3rd day of March of 1900 AD when the British took Pirsa Munda , his age was 25 only .
Similarly, on the 3rd day of March itself Jamshedji Tata has written that his birthday is also an actual possibility .
And he, both of these men, who are in full family guidance, both of them are abundant in the tradition and history of Jharkhand.
In a way Persa Munda , Jamshedji Tata servers in the church of the heart is equal to the legendary history and tradition of Jharkhand .
Adisha, I fully appreciate what you say.
These two great men are not only the name of Jharkhand but also the name of the whole country.
Thank you for their partition all over the country.
If our young men need a hypocrisy man today to guide, he's God Birsa dead.
The British were terrible and terrible when they were dripping him.
Do you know why they're doing something like this
Because the British who established such an universe empire also knew him.
Lord Birsa Munda took the British rule using guns and cannons in his traditional form.
In fact, if people get a head of pregnancy, the mentality of the society becomes very bigger than the power of weapons.
Lord Birsa Munda did not fight with the British for political freedom, but fought for tribal social and economic rights.
In his short-term life, he showed them all.
The treasures, the survivors, went to the sun shining from the life of darkness.
Lord Birsa Munda dedicated his 25-year-old life.
Like Birsa Munda , the saints of Bharat Maa have appeared in all parts of the country .
Such maha pursuits were filled in all the places without being able to see anywhere in India as the unparalleled part of the freedom struggle that has been going on since many centuries .
But unfortunately, the stories about their sacrifice, sun, sacrifice are not going to join the new heroine.
If people like Lord Birsa Munda are feeling ourselves, people like Jamshedji Dada have given important institutions to the country.
If you're right, Jamshedji Tata, they're the visionary of the telescope.
He didn't see the future of India, but made a strong base for it.
He was very well aware of the need to make India a professor of science, technology and industry.
Because of his telescope, Science of Tata Institute was established, now it is known by the name of the Indian Science Corporation.
Not just that, he established many trustworthy agencies and businesses like Tata Steel.
Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vehican also met in a ship during the American trip.
Then both the communications, a matter of importance, the spread of scientific and technology of the Indian country.
As a result of this conversation, the Indian scientific corporation was born.
My lovely folks, our country's former Prime Minister Morarji Pi Country's birthday on 29th February.
You all know that I'm coming only once this day.
Inside, peaceful Morargie Pipe is one of the leaders of the most comprehensive country.
Morargie Pipe Country, who dedicated the most communicable plans report in the independent India government, will serve them.
Morargie Bai, in the most difficult times, was headed by the ability of India, during that time, the democratic system of the country was in great confrontation.
Its merchandise is also very fond of the heads .
Morarji Pipatria had dedicated himself against the obsession to protect the birthplace.
For this, he would have paid a huge price in his own adventure.
And then the government handed him over to jail.
But he was the Prime Minister of the country when he was successful in the 1977 Congress Party.
In his reign, the 44th capital rule was fulfilled.
If this is important, the 42th political settlement was brought to the conclusion of the compulsion, in which apart from reducing the powers of the Supreme Court, there were some other heroes found in it, our Jewish fox, so they were regained.
That is, by the 44th Capital Legislature, the proceedings of the court and the legislative proceedings were made to give authority to the reports.
According to this, some powers of the Supreme Court were reinstated.
According to the 44th capital legislation, the fundamental rights extended to 20, 21 of the Constitution of the Constitution, even if the embarrassment was born, were unforgettable.
It was the first time that in the name of the recommendation given to the authority, the ruler could disrupt the situation.
And the period of immunity cannot be increased in a way over 6 months.
In 1975, how Jeanney was slaughtered on the bed, he promised Morargie Pipe to stop it again.
His participants are important to protect the magnificence of the Great Jews, the heads who want to remember that.
I'll once again see my chariots again for such a great head.
My heart is folk, like every year, there is a lot of enthusiasm among the people about the Padma awards.
Today we're going to bed to a new India.
We'd like to give them honors to whoever wants in the hierarchy.
With the help of your work they create a favourable change in the life of others in different kinds .
Inside, they're real pregnant to themselves.
They do the service of the country without self-sufficiency, social service.
If the Padma awards are to be known, you might have seen the people who were awarded who they were.
Somehow I think it's a big success because they don't appear in the leaf of TV, television.
They're away from the world full of dawns.
But if they're the ones who don't want to be named, they're supposed to be able to get down in the garden.
They live with the talent of Karmasu Kaushalam.
I'd like to share with you about such a few.
You must know about Orissa's niece, not a reason to call him Odisha of Canal Man.
Thaithari Nayak has constructed a trekking road for three kilometres by cutting the mountain from his own hands in his village .
Because of his hard work, he made a complete end to water supply and water problems.
The Kafur Katri of Gujarat will take them
They have done the magnificent work of Buddhists for the traditional Rogan painting of the Garh region .

I gave him a memorial test of the former President of America, Barak Obama, the life painting of Tree made by Sambur.
Shabbir Saiyat, who belongs to Maradwada among Padma awardees, is known as the servant of Pashuda.
It's very impossible how he dedicated himself to the service of Pashuta in his entire life.
The victims of the small blade of Madurai tried to divide the rights of the abolished by the Kalanjiyam campaign of Tamilnadu for the first time.
Also, the social organisation started.
Asked about America's Tao Porchon-Lynch, you may be surprised and surprised.
Lynch has been designed as a movement organisation of yoga art.
In spite of hundreds of years, he has succumbed the yoga art of all over the world, so far 1500 people have become yoga pythons.
Jarkund's famous lady named Lady Tarzan, Jamuna Dudu (Tudu), wooden maizes and naxalites, has worked compassionately to destroy 50 hectares of trees, combination of thirty thousand women, enjoying forest life.
Today, due to their immortal work of Jammu, the village dwellers all celebrate 18 trees while each child is born, 10 trees during the marriage of each woman.
The story of Muktabane Bagjkumar Takli of Gujarat will fill your mind with enthusiasm, even if they see the work done for women's memorial, it will be very difficult to find such examples.
They are engaged in a magnificent work by establishing the construction of the name of Sakshu Mahila Seva Kunj.
The story of Rajkumari Devi , a farmer of Muzaffarpur of Bihar is very predictable .
They made women 's authority and farming profitable .
This farmer maiden mixed 300 women in his area with a self-sufficient team, enjoyed the economically patronage.
He also trained the village women with farming, in other workshops.
Especially he connected technology with agriculture.
People
This year only there are 12 farmers in Padma awardees .
Normally, there are few people in the world related to farming, and those who are engaged in agriculture are still less in the Padmashree list.
But this way as soon as the list is seen it appears to be the life-threatening India .
It shows how much importance is given to the farmers in the new India .
My favorite folks, I'd like to share an experience that touches all of your hearts today, I've been feeling it for the past few days.
Nowadays wherever I go to the country, I am trying to meet some of the beneficiaries of the Prime Minister Jan Health Programme.
There's a chance to talk with some rodes.
The condition of not paying a single person is unable to see his own child 's treatment .
Because of this plan, she was able to see her own well, her child's proper, treatment, both mother and child are healthy.
When the family's head comes to his family to work, he's unable to persuade his job.
Because of this plan, he became favourably healthy and began to live a new life.
Brothers
For the last five months only 12 lakh poor families have been benefitted by this .
I can see how big changes have occurred in the life of humidity .
You can also find out about the poor man who can't get treatment due to money.
If you know that you must explain them about the idea.
It's yourself to all the dresses like that.
My folks in my mind
Examination periods are going on in schools.
Different educational courses across the country will start the exercises for the next few weeks ten, twelve to twelve classes.
I'm supposed to all the students who write the choice, their parents, all the teachers, and my standards of self-reliance.
A few days ago, Bariksha Bay Churcha in Delhi, that was a big event called a dialogue related to the election was held in the town hall.
In this town hall program, I got the opportunity to talk to millions of students living in our country and abroad, with their parents and teachers.
There is an important feature of the communicating programmes related to the selections, discussing the various aspects related to the selections without any restrictions.
For the students certainly many types of beneficial symptoms and ideas have been preserved .
All the students, the readers, the teachers, the U tube will see the light of this event.
My wonderful life for all the examiners about the coming exams
My hearts are folks
If you come to talk about India, can't you talk about honours
Couldn't it
In the same way we can not live in our country on a day without a single day or an unprecedented time, we have seen all the important days in our country.
Because thousands of years old culture is in our very different ways.
A special significance of Shivratri comes on the pilgrimage of Mahashivaratri after a few days , this time comes on the day of the day of the day .
This sacred Shivratrith thrill, and I'm supposed to demonstrate all of you with a magnificent life.
My folks
I went to Kashi some days ago.
I got the chance to spend a hundred years with some of the brothers who made changes there.
He could have spoken with many things, he was really sympathetic to affect his self-confidence.
While talking, the unconscious opponents said one of the young men, only a fabricator.
When you find out that the mimimigrator in the Calling Programmes, I asked you to talk about who you are.
He said I would like the Prime Minister to mimigrate.
At the same time, when I was slightly hungry, I had a surprise waiting for me, how I spoke in the cheek of the mind, just like that, he showed the voice of the mind by Mimikri.
I was glad to know that not only people are listening to the chords of the mind, but in many occasions they remember it.
In fact, I was very embarrassed to see the power of these changing youths, they made me a big impact.
My corners are folks
I have given you a unique experience to join you all through the voice program of the mind.
I'll come in contact with millions of families in a way through the radio every month.
Many times when you talk to you, when you read the written letters, when you hear your phone calls, I think you're treating me as your family member.
This feeling makes me feel a pleasant experience, smooth
.
Buddies
The biggest legislation of the legislatures.
