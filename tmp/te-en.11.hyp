Man Ki Bath, March 2018, my favorite patriot, Namaskar
This is the festival of Lord Rama.
On the day of this Ramanavami festival, many salutations to all the people of the country.
We saw every moment in the life of the worshipped Baba, the power of Ramanama.
A few days ago on 26th January when all the sub-divisionals of Asia came here everybody brought their cultural circles along with them.
Most of them are the pride of showing Ramayana here in most countries.
That's Rama, Ramayana, not only for ourselves but also in the world's territory, has influenced, inspired, inspired all these Asian countries.
I'm telling you the pursuit of Lord Rama for the second time.
My favorite patriot, every time too, your answers in a large number, e-mails, phone calls, camements to me.
Komal Thakur Garu, read me trying to teach Sanskrit language courses by online in my gown app.
Eye professional.
Despite being in Tibet, it's very pleased to see your love in the language of Sanskrit.
I'd like to provide you information about the efforts being made in the propaganda of Sanskrit language through its related department.
In the words of ' minds', even if Sanskrit language is propagated by Taluko, I'm supposed to imagine how to run Komal's suggestion.
From the village of Taluku Baraker of Nalanda district of Bihar, Ghanshyam Kumar taught the comments written in the Narendra Modi app.
He expressed his condolences about the falling waterfall on the ground.
This thing is really so important.
From Karnataka, Shakal Shastri ji used to say so beautifully, "When the whole of mankind is the world when our soul is full of life."
When we're the whole life of our land, we're imagined about every living creature living on this earth.
In summers, we all have to arrange sanctuary for animal birds.
Shakal Garu, I'll get your thoughts to everybody.
Yogesh Bhadheesh said this time I wanted to talk about his health with young people.
As compared to the youth of the rest of Asia , he feels that young people are weak in India .
Yogesh Garu, this time I want to talk to everyone about health, especially fit India.
Then your young man can run the Fit India Festival together.
A few days ago, the French President came to Kashi Yatra.
Prasant Kumarji came to his north that all the pictures related to that journey were affecting the mind.
He wants to spread all the pictures of Taluko, all of the videos, through social media.
Prasant Garu, the Indian government shaved those pictures on the same day followers of social media, Narendra Modi app.
You also like them, retweet them, provide them to all your friends.
Angh, Jaysh from Chennai, and so many children sent me back to all the thoughts that came into your mind on the gratitude cards given by the Exam Warrior book.
Anghki, Jaysh Ky, and all the other kids I have to say, my daily work will be finished by all of your answers.
Many answers, many phone calls, many comments.
In all that I read the answers I read.
I heard a phone call.
Think of things in all of them.
But if it's just rubbishing everything, perhaps with months I've been talking, that shit doesn't break.
You're gonna have to say anything else.
This time there have been answers from most of the children.
The answers written about the tests.
Children who want to do anything in the rocks.
In summers, it was said about providing water to animal birds.
Farmers' dawns, and some of the peasant brothers came from the brothers and sisters about the activities that took place in the fields across the country.
Some wise men sent information about water conservation.
By the medium of radio, we started talking about things in Mansu since we noticed nothing.
In summers the answers are coming only on matters related to summers .
Before the test, the students come to the answers about the disturbance.
At the time of the festival our festivals, our culture, our traditions come to the north of the grave.
I mean, the words in mind change the atmosphere.
Besides, it is also true that things in our mind change the environment of some life.
Why not change
In your words, in your experiences, so much inspiration in your examples, so much power, so much autobiography, the country's penance to do something.
All of them have the power to change the entire country's environment.
I only knew that the person running an autorickshaw named Ahmed Ali, who lived in the Karimganj of Assam, built nine squares with his stairs.
That's why I'm looking at the treasures of our country.
When I heard the story of Dr. Ajit Mohan Choudhari of Kanpur, he went to the poor people living on footpath, not only to provide medical services to him, but also to get free medicines, I got the chance to know the beauty of this country.
The 13-year-old brother of Calcutta's cab driver Syed Lucker died due to lack of medical treatment.
That's why he planned to build a hospital in Saddah, the other poor people who did not die because of the medical preservation.
For his goal, Siddle sold everything in the house, accepted donations.
All the travellers who traveled in his cab allowed to be enjoyed.
A woman's engine gave her her first alive.
After the last twelve years of accumulation, Siddle Laskar succeeded in his Bagirath attempt, as a result of his work, made the hospital located in Pune village near Kolkata, nearly thirty beds.
It's the strength of New India.
A woman from Uttar Pradesh, who built 125 rounds after several conflicts, inspired all women to fight for their rights, maternal power appeared.
Many such inspirational events introduce me to my country.
Yavath's world turned to the point of view towards India.
Now the name of India is thriving so much, and the efforts of such a cowardly child are hidden behind it.
Today, in the countrywide, in the women, in the backward classes, in the poor, in the middle class, we can move forward in all the classes, our country can move forward.
Obviously, there is an atmosphere of self-confidence full of hope.
This is the self-confidence that can simulate our New India Taluko vision.
Can actually do eyes.
My favorite patriot, the months coming are so important for all our farmer brothers, son-in-laws.
Because of this, there have been many answers related to agriculture.
This time I also saw videos of discussions related to farmers in the DD Kissan channel that broadcast the Dardarshan.
Each of these DD Kisan channels, which are transmitted through Dardarshan, should be watched.
I want every rush to put that effort on your own fields too.
Mahatma Gandhi Tundi was considered to be a major part of the library, Lohia Garu, Chaudhari Charan Singh Garu, Chaudhari Devi Lal Garu, all the farming, farmer, our country's economy, and general life.
Soil, cereal, peasantry and peasants have so much support for Mahatma Gandhiji.
That's what he thinks to forget how to dig the earth and to tend the soil, is to forget ourselves.
"In fact, we forget to protect the earth, so that we forget to forget ourselves.
Like Lal Bahadur Shastri also protects trees, plants, trees.
Many times it was sure that the farming system needs to be developed as shining.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia did not make sure that our peasant brothers have a very charming option, shining waterfall facilities.
And the cereals asked to awaken the big tall people to increase the production of milk.
In 1979, Chaudhari Charan Singh wanted to use new technology facilities to the farmers in his funeral, to make new arrangements.
I'm sorry to tell you how much they need.
A few days ago, I went to Malay's Revolution made in Delhi.
Where I was talking to the peasant brothers, sisters, scientists.
I'm very enjoying to know, understand, understand the experiences of their dreaded farming, about the discovery of agriculture.
Knowing about the work of the farmers of the Meghalaya has affected me most.
These regions have shown great work to come down.
Our farmers of the Meghalaya, in the year 2015-16, conducted records and produced records.
When the goal is determined, when the chicken is dared, when it's a vision in mind, they're gonna surely suggest the goal.
It's also working for the farmers' work, technical help.
That's why the farming has made so strong.
A lot of farmers in the norths that came to me were about MSP (MSP means money support).
They also asked me to discuss this matter with them .
Brother Sodari Manulara, this time a big decision has been taken to provide the right cost to the farmers' crops in the budget.
MSP has been decided to have at least one and a half times in their investment for the said crops.
Explains, what is the investment for the MSP to explain is that the workers of the field, the expenses of animals, their grass, the cost of money brought for the money, the cost of all kinds of ears used, the cost of water consumption, the government's finished land, the clothing board on the working capitule, the money collected by the land, etc. are all available.
Besides, if his family members also help him play with a hard-working farmer, their work values are also included in this expenditure.
Besides, the farmer's work is also being done on the agricultural marketing reforms of the country to get the right price for his departure.
The local resources of the villages, the holsel market gardens, and the global markets are trying to meet.
Without the need to go so far to sell the products of the farmers, the APMC and the E-NAM platform are being discovered by developing twenty-two rural monasteries of the country with the necessary administrative facilities .
I mean, in a way, agriculture is being organized by any market in the country.
My favorite country's people, this year, the 150th Jayanti festival of Mahatma Gandhi will be started.

My favorite patriot, on the 14th of April, Baba Saheb Ambedkar's victory.
Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar said about industrialization in many years.
He's so powerful instruction in the eyes of the industry.
It can also get job jobs for the person who doesn't.
Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar has made India a great industrial power.
Now India's propaganda in Make across the country is successfully running, that's why he thinks it's inspiration.
Today India stands a glorious country in the world economy.
The Foreign Direct Investment, the most in the Yavat province, is the FDI for India.
The whole world looks at India as the center of investment, navy, growth.
With the idea of industry being developed in the cities, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar believes in urbanization, urbanization in India.
The Smart Cities Mission, Curban Mission etc. in the country today was started to realize their guess.
With this, efforts are being made to provide all kinds of facilities like good roads, sanctuaries, health facilities, education, digital connectivity facilities etc. in big cities of the country.
Dr. Baba Saheb's self-sufficiency, self-sufficient faith.
He doesn't want any person to live in any way.
Not only that, they don't suppose the fact that their poorness goes away if they distribute something.
Today, the Mudra Passam, the Startup India, the Stand up India is born to our young investigators, young businessmen.
In the decade of 1930 to 1940, only roads and trains were heard in India.
At that time Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke to the port of Guruni, the water routes.
Dr. Baba Saheb Gare recognizes the power of water as the power of the country.
I'm asking you to increase water consumption for patriotism.
Different River Valley authoritys you, all kinds of commissions related to water don't belong to Dr. Baba Saheb.

Old ports are supposed to provide preliminary facilities.
More than 40 years of world war, more popular war, discussions about division are going on.

They talked about the importance of the combined princely system, the social system.
The center of bringing the country into development, the state wants to work together.
Today we accept the co-operative federalism magic of cooperation, co-operative federalism in every part of the administration.
The most important thing is that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar's great inspiration to all those who are tied up with weaker sections.
There is no need to be born in a family named Ganny, a rich family to come up.
The people born in poor families of India can also see their dreams.
He saw us that they can try to shape them, can win.
Many Dr. Baba Saheb also hailed Ambedkar.
He tried to drag him back.
A poor man, a family of the back, tried to do everything possible without being able to find anything in his life.
But the picture of New India is different.
That's India's Ambadkar's dream.
The poor.
They belong to the backward classes.
