My favorite patriot namaskara on January 2018
In the year 2018 this is the first word in Mansu .
Two days ago we celebrated our Republic Day very funny.
The patriots of ten countries are the first time in the history of the country.
My countrymen, Shri Prakash Tripathy wrote a big letter to the Narendra Modi app.
He wanted to explain the things mentioned in his writing in mind.
Well, the imagination that went into space on February 1st, Chawla's anniversary.
Columbia has inspired a few lacs of young worldwide youths to leave us in an accident.
I'm blessed by the brothers Prakash, for the first imagination of Chawla in his long writing.
The loss of imagination in such a small age has made everyone so sad.
But the swimming of the world through its life, especially our thousands of young people in India have any limitations of strength.
Love, if there is a strong vision, if there is any desire to do, it's not impossible.
On the same day all women in India are increasing the country's honor while developing every field.
Since ancient times, the honor of women found in our country, the place they got in society, their contribution is wondering the Yavat world.
There is a tradition of every scholar in India.
In the Vedasar museum, there are many Indian scholars.
Lopa mudra, gargi, mitrei, remember
Now we're making arrangements like "securing birds, reading females" but many years ago, what we say in our sciences, in Skandapuran, "Dasha Port, Sama Kanya, Dasha Putran Prarthanyanat Fruit, gets the medicinal availability, Kanyakakaya".
The prize of ten sons is available only with a daughter.
It shows the importance of women in our society.
That's why our society considers women as strength.
This woman's power stands all over the country, all society, family together.
The scholar of the legendary period, Gargi, Maitrei.
Akkamahadevi, Meerabai, knowledge
Ahlyabai Holkar's administration system
Rani Lakshmibai Veeratta, the woman Shakte is always protecting the country's honour of inspiration from us.
Shri Prakash Tripathy has suggested many examples.
Our brave Defense Minister Nirlan's Sukhoi, 30 warfare flights are inspiring all women.
I am the member of the Indian Navy Women in the leadership of Vehicle Joshi.
Anyone.
S.
V.
The world is traveling on the train.
He also proposed about them.
Emotion Kanth, Mohna Singh, three brave stories of Avani Chaturvedi have been fitter palaces, please take 30 years of training.
In the leadership of Kshamata Vajpai, Al Wimman crew from Delhi to Sanfrancisco in America, then run Air India Boying Jet to Delhi.
Everyone is women.
They're right-- they're supposed to be immortality apart from bringing women everywhere.
Now every field is showing us the most of our women to find something.
They're putting rocks.
A few days ago, the Honorable President started a new work.
The President met an extraordinary women graduate who played something in his own part.
The first woman in this country, the first woman Marchant Nevi captain, Passenger train Taluku, the first woman train driver, first woman bus driver, first woman who reached Antarctica, first woman who attacked Everest, such as the first woman in every field.
Our male power has achieved extraordinary success by accelerating the traditional threads of society.
Fixed a record.
They're determined to create a new path by gathering difficulties, concentrations, concentrations, many contradictions, problems.
That way offers inspiration to the waves that come without your colleagues, that gives them a new excitement.
To know about this woman's power all over the country, from her life, this woman hievers, has also made a book on first ladies.
It's available in the form of e-book at Narendra Modi website.
In the genuine changes happening in the country, society, the country's women's power is the main role of Talu.
Now we're talking about women's authority, so I want to talk about a railway station.
You can't believe what a connection with a railway station co, a woman's authority.
Matunga Station of Mumbai is the first railway station in India full of female staff .
There are women in all sections.
In the commercial department, in the railway police, in ticket checking, in the unauthorized staff, with Poont Person, more than 40 women.
This time, after seeing the Republic Day celebrations parade, many people in the parade by Twitter, other social media, they have suffered a major frenzy.
It's the brave experiment of all women involved in the BSF Biker Contingent
This adventurous experiment vision also surprised everyone who came abroad.
It's a form of self-confidence for women.
Now our women are coming to the leadership.
Becoming selfish.
Another thing like this came to me.
Our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have done a great job.
See a great example.
The matter of adivasi women is i.e. a crucial picture in everyone's mind.
A jungle, in which the painting of women carrying the weight of woods on the slopes of the head is seen.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have shown a new picture to the country.
In the Chattisgarh area, violence, tyranny, bombs, gunshots, Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere.
In such a dangerous area tribal women are standing on their feet by running this rickshaw.
At the same time, all the women met in it.
There are three benefits from this .
On one side, self-employment made them self-reliant.
On the other hand, the area affected by moralism is changing.
Pattu has also strengthened the environmental security.
That's why the district officer's instrument is also addressing.
Until it is necessary to provide help and train them, the district designation machinery has played a very important role in the women's success.
"MA won't change.
We're listening to some words we're saying.
That matter is humiliation, change.
Leave our handlessness, accept changes in the necessary place.
The specialty of our society to correct yourself.
Such an Indian tradition, such culture has gained our heritage.
The symptoms of every conscious society in order to correct itself.
In ages, efforts are being made to fight against the evil practices of our country, individuality, social level.
A few days ago Bihar has taken an interesting new form program .
Human Chain has been the biggest human dinner in the world for spreading the bad practices of the state with fingers more than twelve kilometres .
Through this program, people have been displeased against child marriages, misdeeds.
I hope the entire state is fighting against bad practices for child marriages, evil misconducts etc.
Children, elders, youngsters, mothers, sisters, everybody participated in this fight.
From the historical Gandhi Maidan of Patna etc . this human hall continues connecting unparalleled people to the borders of the state .
If everyone in society has the right developmental results, then society should be free from bad practices like this.
Come on, let's all of us together try to create such a bad practice.
All a new Indian country, set up a powerful, powerful India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar State, the Chief Minister, the administration instrument, every person involved in that human habitation, to make such a distinct, extensive effort as his community welfare.
My favorite patriot, the visitor of Mysore in Karnataka, which is in My Gau AAP, has spent six months for his nutritious treatment.
Let them know about the Primary People's Password.
Don't start buying medicines after knowing about the public medicine center, the cost of medicine has decreased by 75 percent.
Recognizing this, most people want to propagate the matter to the "talk in Mansu" program to benefit.
People are coming to me this thing for a while.
Saying.
I saw their videos benefited by this group socially.
It's very funny to know about such information.
Get so happy.
He's got the idea of the visitor to get anybody else.
It's the purpose behind this packet to encourage Helth Ker, Easy of Living.
The medicines available in the public medicine centers are found to be ninth percent less than the branded medicines sold in the market .
That's why the ordinary people, especially those who use medicines daily, get so much financial support.
The money will also be there.
Generic medicines that are bought in this are at the level of the world health system .
Because of this reason good quality medicines are available at a lower cost .
Three thousand people's medicine centers have been established in the entire country.
Therefore apart from getting the medicines cheaper they also get the options for those who do business on their own .
The medicines of the price of cattle are practiced in the public medicine centers of India , among the hospitals Amritsar stores ' .
This పథకం aims to make every innocent citizen fit health service available.
It is the main mission to build a healthy, rich India.
My favorite patriot, Mangesh of Maharashtra sent a photo to Narendra Modi app.
That's the photo of my eyes turning that side.
There's a mind, together with his taste, swimming in the Clean Morna river cleaning.
The people of Akola have decided to conduct a cleanliness program to clean the Morna river under the Swachh Bharat program.
Morna river flows all over twelve months.
Now it's just moving in a few months.
Another tragic thing is that, the river was completely connected, filled with horse decks.
There's a lot of crazy on the middle shore.
Therefore, making an action plan, the second day of Makar Sankranti, i.e. the first part of January Thirteenth century in the Mission Clean Morna, four kilometres per an area of four kilometres has been completed on both sides of Mona river.
More than six weeks of Akola, more than 100 people, in this good event being called Mission Clean Morena.
G.
Ould, colleges, students, children, old men, mothers, sisters, everybody involved in it.
This clarity program was also held on 20 January 2018.
I told Morna river is completely clean, every Saturday morning this cleaning program is going on.
If man fails to find anything, it proves it's unavailable.
Great changes can be brought through public orders.
I appreciate every citizen who transformed this work to the district, urban subordinate, to the people, to their efforts.
Your attempt to inspire everyone in the country.
My favorite patriot, you're listening to the discussions on the Padma awards.
Journalists, TV attract our attention to this matter.
You look pretty proud if you wanna shut down.
Any great man who's in our midst is proud.
Normal people in our country also seem proud to reach the level without any kind of help.
There is a tradition of giving Padma awards to every descendant, but the process of Padma awards has changed in the last few days.
Now nobody can imminate anybody for this award.
The procedure came in the entire online.
In a way the entire process of selection of these awards has changed.
A lot of ordinary people will also see you getting pamphlets.
Ordinarily in TV, in big cities, newspapers, public meetings are getting pamphlets.
That's why he's growing the frontier of the work he's doing without the person's familiarity to give the award.
I.
I.
Aravind Gupta, a student of T . Kanpur, will enjoy hearing the comfort of spending his whole life in making potatoes for the children.
In order to increase the interest of science in children he is making potterys with luxurious things for a past 40 years .
He aims to inspire children to use scientific things.
Therefore, he is inspiring the children by watching films made in 18 languages going to three thousand schools across the country.

He turned into God at the age of the boys.
Afterwards the development of Goddesses incorporated his entire life.
Besides, they also organized unprecedented programs for the life of strong women.
You will also hear about the Bajju sham of Madhya Pradesh.
They were born in a disappointed tribal family.
They do an ordinary job to live.
But he had the habit of painting traditional tribals.
This spread has brought him so much fame worldwide than in India.
In many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England, Italy, there were demonstrations.
Recognizing the talent of Bajju Sham, which enhanced India's fame in foreign countries, gave him Padmasri.
Listening to the story of Lakshmi Kutti of Kerala you will be enjoyed .

I guess I need to reproduce another name.
Mistry of the twenty-five shoes of the West Bengali.
They also chose Padma awards.
To build a hospital, Sukhphani Mistry stabbed in other houses, sold vegetables.
At the age of twenty-four, the husband of the beauty of the medical facility died.
That incident posessed to build hospitals for the poor.
They are providing free treatment to every thousand people in the hospital built with so much difficulty.
I don't know anybody in our magnificent India's land, and I believe that no one knew such a nerve, none of the gem.
Not being recognized by such people is harm to society.
Living for our adjoining society, engraving lives for society, working with the goal of life all day with some specialty.
Get them to society ever.
That's a way to the Padma awards.
They don't want honors.
Worked for them.
But we get inspiration through their actions.
Schools, colleges, all listen to their experiences.
There must be some attempts in society even after crossing the awards.
Every year we celebrate 9th January as the Pravasth Bharatiya Day celebrations .
Gandhiji came back to India from South Africa on this date.
On this day we celebrate the bond between all the Indians living in all parts of the world in India.
This time, the parlment members of the Indian Republic of India residing in the Nation of Pravas Bharatiya Divas, have invited the fairs to all of us a programme.
In that program, Malaysia, New Yealand, Switlerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanania, Kenya, Canada, Britan, Surinam, South Africa, and other countries, from other countries, and other countries wherever our India's reconciliation meets, our partnership members in other countries.
People living in different countries of India, while serving indigenous countries, have enjoyed me to strengthen our relations with India as well.
This time the media union sent me to the calendar.
In which he showed the work done by Indians living in different countries in Europe in different parts .
Some Indians living in different countries of Europe work in cyber security, some have been mentioned to Ayurveda.
Some are enjoying society with their music, and with poetry.
Some research on environmental changes, some worked on Indian texts.
If you run a truck and build a master, another mosque is built.
Where our Indians were they decorated the land there somehow.
I'm thanking Ganu's combination to know the people of Indian origin, to know their information about the people of the world through their medium.
Bapuji's anniversary showed us the right path on January 30th.
That day we celebrate martyrs' day celebrations.
On that day we pay homage to the great martyrs who dedicated their lives to patriotism at 11:30 hours.
Peace, the path of non-violence is the path of Bapooji.
India, world, a man, a family, a guy who lives in a guidance for the sacred priest of society, who tells us what they are still the most suitable.
They're not just the principles of poetry.
Even in the present times, we've seen the words of Bapooji as true.
We're supposed to walk in the bapooji baat, how much can we walk, what's the greatest reverence of bapooji
My favorite patriot, telling all of you 2018, my words are so finished.
Thank you a lot.
Namaskar
