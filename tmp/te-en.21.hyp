In Akashwani, on 28th May, 2017, the Prime Minister of the Nation, Manki Bath (Speak in Mansu), is full of fond of my country, Namaskara.
We can't forget summer this weekend.
But we're waiting for the rainy season.
From this day I'm talking to you, the sacred Ranjana month has begun.
During the sacred Ranjana month, the people of the country of India, especially the Muslim community, are my heart full of cleanliness.
In the month of Ranjan, prayers, spirituality, ties give a lot of speciality.
All our Indians are our lucky luck to make our ancestors a humiliating tradition.
For all the traditions of the world to stay in our country, we must live in all our countrymen .
In our country there are Astikulu, Nastikulu.
The idol worshippers are those who oppose the worship of idols.
Such Siddhantalu, such worshippers, such a tradition, has made us digest the art of being together.
Religions, traditions, principles, beliefs, give us a single message - that's peace, unity, perfectness.
This peace, unity, supports this charming month of sacredness to go ahead.
I'm supposed to appreciate everyone again.
I used to say a word in "Manus" last time, especially with young people.
Get out of your confort zone and do something new
Look at new experiences.
I said that's the right wizard to face difficulties, by taking a customary risk in life.
I'm very happy to give it a lot of people to bury it.
Personally everyone has been excited to tell your own things.
I couldn't read all of that, I couldn't listen at least to every single message.
All the more messages came.
But I haven't seen anything sensitive, but some tried to learn music, some are trying to learn new things, some are trying to learn new languages with the help of YouTube.
Some learn cooking, some are learning dance, some learn to play, some have even started writing poems.
Knowing the nature, living, trying to understand.
I'm very enjoyed.
I'm supposed to hear you even by calling a phone.
That's what, I'm talking to Diksha Katal.
The habit of my reading went all over.
So in this holiday I decided to read again.
I understand when I start reading about civil war.
India has come to fight for freedom, how many sacrifices have to be given, how many freedom fighters won't kill anyone in prisons.
At the young age, how many of the folk artists were impressed by Bhagat Singh.
That is why the young man wants to give you a message about this matter .
About our country's history, about our freedom fighters, the country has made me very happy to show our youth interests to know about their survivors.
The great men counted their youth were lost in prisons.
All the youngsters are burnt.
Every week there have been many problems that we can suffocate in the freedom of India.
Any great men in the freedom struggle have worked very big in reading, writing all weeks in prisons.
We also know that weekly compositions have given us a lot of strength to the country's independence.
I went to see Salyular Jail to Andaman Nicobar, much before.
This is the victory of Veer Savar Karya.
He wrote a book 'Maji Birthday' in jail.
The poems are coming.
They're coming on the walls.
He bound him in a small dark room.
Freedom lovers do not feel any kind of rivalry .
When I read the book Savarkar's Maji Birthday, I'd like to see the Cellular Jail.
There's also the sound show of Little there.
It's very inspirational.
For freedom, the Andaman Jail has lost his youth who experienced Kalapani punishment in this celebrity jail, who speaks every language of every state of India.
People speaking every language, everybody from everywhere, people of every kind experienced tricks.
This is the victory of Veer Savar Kar.
People don't feel any tricks for the freedom that we got, don't have any problems, look at Cellular Jail, why do you know Kalapani, I'm sure to tell the country's youth.
If you can, you must go to this pilgrimage related to our freedom struggle.
Lovely people of my country, one Monday in June 5.
Normally but no specialties.
But, June 5 is a special day.
Because that day we celebrate the World Environment Day.
This surrounding united state committee is the survival of this year that connecting people to Nature.
In another word, back to basics.
What is research done by nature .
In my view it means we have to meet us.
Get us connected to us.
Looking at nature, raising the better plant.
Who can say this congress better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi said so many times that he was "one must carabout a world zone will not see".
I mean, we should also think about the world we see, take care of.
You're looking at the power of nature that when a glass of water gets tired then it will be so fresh.
When the room got tired, opening the windows, opening the doors, swallowing fresh air, new consciousness comes.
When the body gets created by the five elements, when those five elements are touched, there is a new excitement in our body, a new energy appears.
It's all we have experience.
But we hold it.
We put it on a cross.
Don't bind a formula.
You must look at it, when you have a natural touch, you will get a new awareness.
Therefore the world's effort to get rid of nature on 5th June should also be our own effort.
The result of our ancestors saved the environment is now available to us.
If we save our lives now, it will benefit the coming waves.
Pains circumvent, climates the energy roots.
This description is available in our vedas.
To say in one way, the direction of the entire environment of the Atharvana vedas.
It was written thousands of years ago.
It is said to be ' Mother Earth: Putro Ahm Prithvia'.
The obsessions say that the cause of our cleanliness is pathetic.
Yeah, our mother, we're her child.
When Buddha looks at God, the birth of Lord Buddha, his knowledge gained, his Mahapaniravan died under a tree.
In our country too many festivals, many puja practices.
Educated, learned, urbanized, rural, tribal, everyone's natural worship, love for nature is part of their social life.
But we need to link this thing with modern deliberations, modern thoughts.
This way I'm shivering from the States.
As the rain begins in almost all the states, the program begins with big tall plants.
Crores of plants are planted.
The school also adds kids.
Social service organizations, governmental organizations.
The government itself takes chicken.
We also encourage plants to work in this season of rains.
Cooperate.
My favorite patriot, June 21, is the world's familiar day.
The Yavat world celebrates this day as the World Yoga Day celebrations.
June 21, the world's Yoga Day celebrations spread the roots of the roots at the dawn, bringing people closer.
On one side, while showing many strange powers in the world, India is a great gift given to the world.
The Yavat world can be covered with a formula by Yoga.
Like the mind, the intelligence, all the body, the soul, and this day the Yoga is close to the world.
Now, because of our lifestyle, hardness, it becomes difficult to live a stressless life due to increasing responsibilities.
We're supposed to be this situation even in the pinned boys.
Somebody's putting a drug and spending the day.
In such a situation Yoga plays so important role in life without stress .
Well Ness, Fit Ness.
The two-related flower gives yogas.
Yoga is not just exercise.
An inner journey for health through thought, thought, mind, intelligence, all body.
If you feel that inner journey, it's possible through yoga.
Two days ago, keeping in mind the Yoga Day celebrations, I came to the north of all the governments of the world, all of Natal.
Yesterday I announced some competitions related to yoga.
I declared some prides.
Gradually those directions move forward.
I got advice.
I appreciate those who gave them that fundamental advice.
It's a very interesting advice.
It's the third International Yoga Day celebration.
This time during the third International Yoga Day celebrations, three classes of the same family wanted me to give me the same time as yogasana.
Grandma, thirty sweets, granny, thirsty, all right, parents, sons, kids, and a three-wheeler mixed together and upload those photographs.
Stay, today, this beautiful combination of tomorrow gives a new size to Yogas.
I'm thanking those who gave this advice.
It's a matter of fact that we've achieved a very interesting experience by way of ' Self-wit-dater'.
The photographs of these three varieties of yogasanas are surely admired by the country and the world.
Okay, where they're yogic, they're mixing the photographs of yoga, you must send me the Narendra Modi app coo, my pocket.
All right, no, these paintings are a charming repetitive barosa.
We have three weeks more time for International Yoga Day celebrations.
I'm invited to all of you.
Start the conduct from now.
I'm also posting things related to yoga everyday in Twitter from 1st June.
By 21st June, I'll be sharing you.
You should also propagate things about yoga with three weeks.
Promote it.
Go connecting people.
In a way it's called the Priventive Health Care Framework.
I'm inviting you all to join this funeral.
Since all of you handed me the responsibility of the 'Constitution Service', then my first referendum from the Red Fort got the chance to speak for the first time from there on August 15, I'm talking about cleanliness.
Since then I have been toured in different times of India .
So back when I saw, what are some very minute modies doing
Where are Modi going
Moody's going to be very fond of what's doing.
Because I got a very interesting phone call.
If you say something like that, you don't guess like that.
But I'm solicited to them for they noticed this.
If you hear this phone call, you'll understand it.
"Modi Garu, Namaskar
I'm talking to Naina from Mumbai.
Modi Garu, I'm looking forward to TV, with social media that people are taking special care of cleaning everywhere you go.
Yes, Mumbai, Surat.
On your invitation, people are accepting the clarity of the crowds as an extraordinary action.
In the elders, the children also got an idea of clarity.
Many times I saw them stopping the giants who were crazy on the streets.
The propaganda of the pursuits you started from Kashi Ghat, became a fervour with your inspiration.
"Your words are true.
Going to the neighborhood, the government instrument conducts the cleaning program.
But even in this middle society the clarity became a festival.
Five days before I go, seven days ago, ten days ago, cleaning up at a very big height.
Transmission methods also give it so much importance.
A few days ago I went to Kutch area of Gujarat.
There was only a big program about clarity.
I didn't see it, but if I thought after the phone was called so far, that incident really happened.
You can guess if you're enjoying me, not seeing this, not knowing how carefully all these things are in the country.
Do I have the joy of knowing the cleverness added to my journey as well
How other thanks to invite the Chief Minister.
But, they're getting more privilege than just pursuing the clarity.
It's someone who loves cleaning himself.
It's sparky.
I appreciate this clarity program even every day.
Someone gave me advice.
Really the advice is very excited.
I don't even know if I can do it.
Modi Garu, what kind of tourism you want when you decide on your tour, "Baboo, tell me how much will your cleanliness level be
How many tons of deaf ears can you give me pride
Tell me I'll decide on my tour.
"I said.
Treatment is well but I need to think.
But make such a fun.
It's a good thing to give prize to cleaning these tunes better than giving something prize.
By doing this many people will be saved from the victim of disease .
It's how much it increases humanity.
Just one thing I've got to say.
This bad deaf is not what it is.
It's property.
A forest.
Don't look at it just as you do it.
Once we begin to consider this evil thing as a property, we will bring us many new methods of vain control.
Young people reaching Start-Ap also come forward with new ideals.
Get new equipment.
With the help of state governments, the Government of India has decided to start an important programme on the management of wastes with the help of the patriots of the cities.
On 5th June, the World Environment Day celebrations narrate, the country's nearly 4-wheeler cities are getting useful means to absorb the liquid form.
Both types of bad dusts are available .
One thin color dump, another blue color dump.
Wet dry, dry dry.
Two types of wastes come out.
We pursue the sequence, put in two types of dry blue blue dusts in these 4-wheeler towns, into the wet shit dump.
Like the skins of vegetables coming from inside, the finished food materials, the pebbles, the rotten plants, the leaves of the trees also fall under the wet ear.
Get them all in the fucking dump.
All these work well in the fields.
Remember the fields are green, what's in the green shit in the wine.
The second type of bad dust comes into the dry branches like dry potatoes, palms, irons, glasses, clothes, plastic, polythene, broken dust, rubber, metal etc.
They have to be recycled by putting in machines.
I believe we can start a culture.
We have to put new steps towards every sari cleaning.
And then we can realize Gandhiji's eyes about cleanliness.
Now I'm gonna tell you about a matter of glory.
Okay, if a man decides straightforwardly, how big adventures can run.
Cleanness is like Taluko's work.
You'll be listening in the past few days.
Versova beach speaking as a deserted place in Mumbai has turned into a clean, beautiful Versova beach.
It didn't happen at all.
With about eighty-nine weeks of summit, the city's hardships have changed the form of this Versova beach.
Thousands of tins of bitches were removed from that place and now Versova beach became clean, beautiful.
Versova Residence Volunteer (VRV) took its full responsibility.
Mr. Afroz Shah's one-day was abolished in this work since October 2015.
Gradually that program became big, public fun.
The United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) gave Ganu Afroz Shahji the big award for doing this work .
The Earth Award of Champions became the first Indian who received that award.
I appreciate Afroz Shah's, I'm telling my appreciation for this fun.
As a folk collection, he lived the people of that whole area, making it a public furore, an inspirational example.
My brother-in-law, I want to share another pleasure with you.
About the Reasi Black of Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir, regarding the Swachh Bharat Festival.
Reasi block is free of urination -LRB- open defectation free -RRB- in six places .
Tell me it's ODF.
To all the people of the Riyasi block, the rulers there also gave a good example to Kashmer by Jammu.
I'm saying greetings to the people there.
This whole furnace has been run by most of the women of that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
In order to increase awareness about this, they also make travels to Divity themselves.
Hollywood, excite people to go everywhere.
Ganu tells me my heart full of pleasures to make a blank of defectation free of a black on the Kashmer grass of Jammu, the sister-in-law.
Dear, my country's public, in the last fifteenth to ninth months, in the newspapers, with TV channels, in social media, people are looking at the government's calculations.
You gave me the responsibility of survivor' before the fools.
Many observations, visions have been collected.
I'll accept all these procedures as healthy instructions.
In every test, all these thumbs were tested.
Every section of the society embarrassed it.
There's an excellent process in democracy.
I clearly believe the governments in democracy have to be answerable.
People have to pay the calculations of their work to the government.
Somewhere enjoyments, somewhere helped, somewhere, somewhere showed up the darkness.
I'm thanking everyone who was deeply embarrassed about our work when it's time.
I'm thankful to the weekends provided by the most important feedback.
Inside, there is a chance to fix them only when you come in the dark light.
Well, something good, bad, learning something from it, learning from it, walking before the evening.
Constructive observation strengthens democracy.
For an unprecedented country, a conscious country needs this message.
Love my countrymen, I'm also a common man like you.
Good, bad for a simple citizen, every thing impacts on the mind of a simple citizen.
Some people see the program in Mansu only on one side of the speech.
Some do business with political vision.
But, with so much experience, I don't think I'm going to make this program a civilian in every family of India when I start talking in mind.
For once I'm talking home things sitting between family members in the house.
That's what they've done to me in many families.
As I said, the impact of my mind as a simple citizen was made two days ago by the governors of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Vice President Garu, Speaker Garu, together, dedicated a description book in Mansu.
A man, an ordinary citizen, raised this event with my enthusiasm.
Even while sitting in that big place, I'm blessed by the Ganu prince, the Deputy President, Speekerji, for giving so much importance to the word in Mansu.
In a way, the word in Mansu has given a new point to the program.
Some of our friends talked to me sometimes when they worked on this book in Manus.
I was surprised when I came to discuss this sometime ago.
A artist named Akbar Saheb, living in Abu Dhabi.
He himself proposed poetry by his art for the things discussed in the ' Mansu Talk ' program .
Without taking a single rupee, Akbar's mind explained his love by giving artistic form to the words.
I'm solicited to Akbar.
My dear patriot, this time we're raining all over the country just to meet.
The weather will change.
The results of the test are coming.
Starting in a new hole.
As the rains fall - a new excitement, new aroma, a new smell.
Come on, let's all move forward with love for nature in this environment.
Thank you, many pursuits to all of you on my own.
