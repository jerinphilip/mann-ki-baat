Talking about the mind, May 2016, my dear countrymen, greetings.
Then once I got an opportunity to talk about "mind".
This is not a "mind" thing for me.
I myself am very keen to interact with you and I am happy that through every corner of India, I am able to join the common people of the country.
I am also grateful to the AIR also that he has made a successful effort to present this "mind" in the regional languages at 8.00 in the evening.
And I am also happy that those who listen to me later, through the letter, through the telephone, through MyGov Website, through Narendra Modi app to my emotions.
Many of your things help me in government work.
How active should the government be in terms of public interest, how many primary public interest work should be, for these things my relationship with you, this relationship is very useful.
I hope you will definitely emphasize how democracy goes through public participation by becoming more active.
The heat is increasing.
We used to hope, there will be some reduction, but the experience came that the heat is increasing.
It was also reported in the middle that perhaps the monsoon would delay one week, then the concern increased further.
The maximum part of the country is feeling horrific fire of heat.
Mercury is touching the sky.
Be animals, be birds, be humans, everyone is upset.
Due to the environment, these problems are increasing.
The forests were reduced, trees were cut and in a way the human being destroyed nature and paved the path of destruction.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
There are discussions for the environment all over the world, worrying.
This time nited nations have placed this topic on the World Environment Day for Ero Tolerance for Fillegal World Trade.
It will be discussed, but we have to discuss trees and plants, also discuss water, how to increase our forest.
Because you must have seen, in the lap of Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir - Himalayan, the fire in the forests
The root cause of the fire was that if the dry leaves and some negligentness are carried out, then it spreads into a very big fire and therefore saving forests, saving water - it becomes the responsibility of all of us.
In the past, in the states where I have more drought, there is an opportunity to discuss with the Chief Ministers of 11 such states in detail.
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha - Although the tradition of the government, I could have a meeting of all drought-affected states, but I did not do this.
I have different meetings with every state.
With one state spent nearly two to two, two and a half hours.
What the states have to say, listen to them closely.
Generally, in the government, how much money went from the Indian government and how many expenses were spent - it does not matter more closely.
It was also surprising for the officials of our Government of India that many states have made very best efforts, in relation to water, in relation to the environment, to deal with the situation of drought, for animals, for effective humans and in a way, in every corner of the whole country, why not the government of any party, it came to experience that this problem, from the long term situation, what should be done, what should be the permanent treatment, it was also focused on.
In a way, there was also a learning experience for me and I have told my policy commission that there should be no work on how to take best practices in all the states.
Some states, especially Andhra, Gujarat has used a lot of texchanology.
I would like to bring the special successful efforts of the states by the next policy commission to us and the states.
Public participation is the basis of a huge success in solving such problems.
And if it is perfect planning, use proper texchnology and try to complete arrangements in the deadline
I believe that the best results can be found.
By taking rough management, taking water conservation, dropping water, because I always believe, water - this is the offering of God.
Like we go to the temple, give a prasad and a little of Prasad falls, then there is anger in the mind.
Raise him and apologize to God five times.
This water is also the prasad of God.
If a drop is also ruined, then we should suffer.
And therefore, water and irrigation is equally important, water conservation is equally important, water irrigation is equally important and therefore, per drop-more crop, micro-irrigation, at least water.
Now it is a matter of joy that in many states our sugarcane farmers are also using micro-irrigation, someone is using drip-irrigation, someone is doing sprinkler.
I sat with the states, so some states have also used drip-irrigation successfully for paddy, which they cultivate, and due to which their yields also increased, water also saved and wages also decreased.
When I heard from these states, many states are such that those who have taken huge targets, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Three states have done a lot of work in drip-irrigation and they are trying to get involved in two-two, three-three lakh hectares of micro-irrigation every year.
If this campaign is going on in all the states, then agriculture will also benefit greatly, water will also be accumulated.
Our brothers of Telangana have tried to use the water of Godavari and Krishna river by "Mission Bhagirathi".
Andhra Pradesh's "Neeru Pragati Mission" also tried to use texchanology in it, ground water recharging.
In the mass movement that Maharashtra has created, people are also shedding sweat, giving money too.
"Water camp campaign - Indeed this movement will be a lot of work to save Maharashtra from the future crisis, I feel like this.
Chhattisgarh has launched "Loksuraj - Jalsuraj" campaign.
Madhya Pradesh's "Balram Talab" scheme - very close to 22 thousand ponds
These are not small figures .
Work on this is going on.
His "Kapildhara Coop Scheme"
Chief Minister Water Save Campaign from Uttar Pradesh
In Karnataka, work has been started to revive wells as "Kalyani" scheme.
Rajasthan and Gujarat have launched a big campaign to revive them as a water temple, where there are more old times.
Rajasthan has launched Chief Minister Water-Swavalamban campaign.
Jharkhand is a wild area, but there are some areas where there is water problem.
He has launched a huge campaign of check am.
They have tried to stop water.
Some states have campaigned towards preventing ten-ten, twenty-two kilometers of water by making small dams in the rivers.
This is a very pleasant experience.
I also tell the countrymen that this June, July, August, September - We will decide, one drop of water will not be wasted.
Manage from now, what can happen instead of saving water, what can be the place to stop water
God gives water according to our needs, nature fulfills our needs, but if we look very careless after seeing water and when the water season ends, then without water, how can it go
And this water doesn ' t mean just the subject of the farmers
This village is a matter related to everyone, poor, laborers, farmers, urban, rural, rich and poor - and so the rain is coming, the water is our priority and this time when we celebrate Diwali, enjoy how much water we saved, how much water stopped.
You see, our happiness will increase manifold.
He is tired of water, how tired we have come, sprinkle a little water on the mouth, so how much fresh it becomes.
How tired we have been, but see the huge lake or see the water of the ocean, then what is the feeling of Viratta.
How a precious treasure belongs to God
Connect with him, protect him, promote water, also make water and irrigation modern.
I am telling this with great urgency today.
This weather is not allowed to go.
For the next four months drop-drop water, it is to change the "water saving" campaign and it is not just the governments, but not the politicians, it is the work of public.
Media gave a detailed account of water trouble in the past.
I hope media guides people towards saving water, campaign and media also become partners for ever liberating from water crisis, I also invite them.
My dear countrymen, we have to make modern India.
We have to make transparent India.
We have to make many arrangements equal from one corner to the other corner of India, so our old habits will have to change a little too.
Today I want to touch a subject on which if you help me, then we can successfully move forward in that direction.
We all know, we were taught in school that there was a time, when there was no coins, there was no notes, the water system used to happen that if you need vegetables, then give so many wheat in return.
If you want salt, then give such a vegetable in return.
The business used to run from the barter system.
Gradually the currency started coming.
Coin started coming, coins started coming, notes started coming.
But now the time has changed.
The whole world is moving forward towards cashless society.
Through the electronic technology system, we can get the money, even pay the money.
You can buy things, you can also square the bill.
And this will never raise the question of theft of the jab.
There will be no concern to keep accounting, there will be automatic accounting.
The beginning will look a little difficult, but once the habit will take place, then this system will be simplified.
And this is the possibility that we started the campaign of "Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana" these days, the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country opened.
On the other hand, the Aadhaar number was also found and the mobile has reached the hands of every Indian in almost India.
So coordinating "Jan-Dhan, "Aadhaar and "Mobile" (JAM), J.A.M., we can move forward towards this cashless society."
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given with Jan-chan account.
In the coming days, these cards are going to work in terms of credit and debit.
And nowadays a very small I
Enstrument has also come, which says Point of Sale - P.S. P.S. With the help of him, you are your base number, Rupay card, you have to pay any money, then you can give it.
To withdraw money from the zeb, count, do not need it.
There is no need to roam together.
Whatever the Indian government has initiatives, how to pay money through a POSC, how to get money.
The second thing we started is Bank on Mobile - Environmental Payment Interface Banking Transaction - PI
I'll change the way.
Money transmission through your mobile phone will be very easier and it's good that N.P.I.
And the bank is working to launch this platform through mobile app and if it happened, maybe you may not have to keep Rup Day Card together.
In the country, young people have been recruited as nearly banking correspondents.
In a way the bank has worked in that direction at your door.
Post Office has also been alerted for banking services.
If we learn to use these arrangements and habit, then we will not need this currency, notes will not need, money will not be needed, business will run automatically and due to it a transaction will come.
Two-number businesses will be closed.
If the effect of black money will be reduced, then I urge the countrymen to start.
Look, once we start, we will move forward very easily.
Twenty years ago, who thought that so many mobiles would be in every hand.
Gradually habited, now you can not live without it.
Maybe this cashless society also takes the same form, but it will be better if it happens in less time.
My dear countrymen, whenever the games of lympic come and when the game begins, then we sit in the head, how far behind we lived in God Medal, Silver did not get it, Bronze didn't run it, it lives.
It is true that there are many challenges in our sports, but there should be an environment in the country.
Encouraging our players going to Rio Limpic, encouraging them, everybody in their own way.
Write a song, make a cartoon, give a best wishes, encourage any game, but the whole country should create a very positive atmosphere towards our players.
The result that will come - will come.
The game is - the game is also, the win is also, the defeat comes, the medal also comes, but the courage should be strong and when I talk, then my sports minister Shriman Sarbanand Sonowal also touched me for a job, so I want to tell you.
What will be the results of the elections last week, what will be the results in Assam, and Mr. Sarbanand ji himself was leading Assam elections, he was also the Chief Minister of the Government of India, and when I got this information, it was great that he reached Patiala without informing anyone before the Assam elections, Punjab
You all know Netaji Subhash National ID
Enstitute of Sports (NIC
S) Where our players going to the limpic are training, they are all the same.
They suddenly reached there, there was also surprise for the players and there was also a surprise for the sports world that a minister would worry so much in this way.
What is the arrangement of the players, what is the arrangement of food, according to the requirement, the need for nutrition food is not getting, the necessary trainer for their body is not that they are trainers.
All the machines of training are running well that are not running.
He saw all the things closely.
Going to the room of one player.
Talking to the players in detail, talked to the management, talked to the trainer, himself also ate food with all the players.
Election results are going to come, as the Chief Minister, there is a possibility of new obligation, but still if I have so much concern about this work as a fellow sports minister, then I am happy.
And I believe, we all understand the importance of the game in this way.
Encourage the people of the sports world, encourage our players.
It becomes a big force in itself, when the player feels that hundreds of millions of people stand with him, then his courage gets stronger.
Last time I
EA Ender-17 had spoken for World Cup and the suggestions that I came from all over the country, and these days I have seen that an atmosphere of Cootball has started to gaze all over the country.
Many people are making their teams with initiatives.
I've received thousands of suggestions on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Many people may not be playing, but there is so much interest in the game of thousands of young people of the country, it was a pleasant experience for me in itself.
We know cricket and India's attachment, but I saw so much attachment to Cootball too.
It indicates a very pleasant future in itself.
So for Rio Limpic, we have an atmosphere of enthusiasm and enthusiasm towards all our players.
Everything should not be won and defeated by the criterion.
With sportsman spirit, India has its identity in the world.
I appeal to the countrymen to do something in creating an atmosphere of enthusiasm and enthusiasm towards our sports companions.
From the last eight-ten days, new results are coming from somewhere.
I'm not talking about the results of the election.
I'm talking about those students who worked hard throughout the year, gave me, 10th, 12th, a result has started coming after one.
It is clear that our daughters are showing power.
It's a pleasure.
Those who have succeeded in these results are my best wishes, congratulations.
Those who have not succeeded, I would like to say once again that there is a lot to do in life.
If there is no result according to our wishes, then no life is stuck.
Belief should live, beyond faith.
But a big new type of question has come to me and I never thought about this matter.
But a e-mail came on my MyGov, so I noticed.
There is no Mr. Gaurav in Madhya Pradesh, Gaurav Patel - He has presented a big difficulty in front of me.
Gaurav Patel is saying that I have got 89.33 per cent in M.P.
So I thought of reading this, wow, is it a matter of happiness, but further they are saying the story of their sorrow.
Gaurav Patel is saying that when I reached home with 89.33 percent marks, I was thinking that I would get congratulations from all sides, congratulations
But I was surprised, everyone in the house said this to me, hey man, four marks come more, you get 90 percent.
That is, my family and my friend, my teacher - Nobody was happy with my 89.33 percent marks.
Everyone was telling me, man, you left 90 percent for four marks.
Now I can't understand how to handle such a situation.
Is this everything in life
What did I do, wasn't that good
Did I also get some less
I don't know, I have a burden on my mind.
Gaurav, I have read your letter very carefully and I think, perhaps this pain will not be yours, but millions of students like you, because an environment has become such that what has happened, Instead of satisfaction, dissatisfaction from it It is the second form of negativeness.
We can never take society towards satisfaction by finding dissatisfaction from everything.
Well, your family, your colleagues, friends would have appreciated your 89.33 percent, so you would have decided to do more on your own.
I urge parents, surrounding people to accept your children who have come with the results, welcome, express satisfaction and encourage him to move forward, otherwise, the day may also come that after 100 per cent, you will say that Bhai came 100, but still if you do something like that, then something of everything should be limited.
Santosh Giri Goswami from Jodhpur He has also written, almost written in this way.
They say that people around me are not accepting our results.
They say that they do something else, do something else good.
I do not remember the poem, but I had read long ago, some poet wrote that I made a pain pain on the Anvas of Life.
And when he had an exhibition, people came, everyone said, need touch-up, someone used to say that it would have been yellow instead of blue, would have been good
Someone used to say, this line would have been there instead, so would have been good.
Would that, on the picture of my pain, a single audience would have shed tears.
These words were the words of poetry, I do not remember this now, but there is a long poem, but the price was the same.
No one of that picture could understand the pain, everyone was talking about touch-up.
Santosh Giri ji, your concern is the same as the glory and you will have millions of students like you.
You have a burden on fulfilling the expectations of the people.
I will say to you that in such a situation you do not lose your balance.
Everyone expresses expectations, keep listening, but keep on talking and try to do something better.
But you will not satisfy what has been found, then you will never be able to build a new building.
The strong foundation of success is the basis of great success.
Dissatisfaction arising out of success does not make the ladder of success, it becomes a guarantee of failure.
And so I will urge you to humm the success that has achieved, the possibility of new success will be born out of that.
But this thing I want to say more than parents and colleagues that you do not impose your expectations on them by gratitude with your children.
And friends, have sometimes failed in life, do they stay alive
Who can never bring good marks in Ceam, he goes very far in sports, goes ahead in music, goes ahead in artwork, goes ahead in business.
God has given everybody a wonderful mode.
Just, recognize the power within you, emphasize it, you will go ahead.
And it happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard the instrument named Santoor.
There was a jamna, the Santoor instrument was connected to the olk Music in the Valley of Kashmir.
But there was a Pandit Shiv Kumar, who handled him and made him an important instrument in the world today.
Shehnai - Shehnai was in a limited place throughout our music.
Most of the kings and queens who used to be the court, they had their place on the gate.
But when Ustad Bismillah Khan handled the clarinet, today became the best instrument of the world, it has become an identity.
And so leave the worry about what you have, what is it, get together on it, get involved.
The result will be available only.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I see that the expenditure on health of our poor families also makes the track of life unbalanced.
And it is true that the cost of not being ill is very low, but after being ill, the cost of being healthy is very high.
Why do not we live such a life, so that there is no financial burden on the family.
One is the biggest basis for saving cleanliness from disease.
If someone can do the biggest service of the poor, then he can do cleanliness.
And the other for which I constantly urge, that is yoga.
Some people call him Yoga too.
June 21 is International Yoga Day.
There is also an attraction towards yoga all over the world, there is also reverence and the world has accepted it.
Our ancestors have a precious gift given to us, which we have given to the world.
The world with stress gives the strength to live a balanced life.
Prevention is better than cure. Being healthy in the life of a person associated with yoga, being balanced, wealthy of strong will and power, being full of unprecedented self-confidence, concentration in every work - These are easy achievements.
June 21 - Yoga Day, this is not just a weekend, its extension increased, every person has his place in his life, every person spent 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes for yoga.
And for this, June 21 Yoga Day inspires us.
And sometimes the collective environment causes change in the life of the person.
I hope, June 21, wherever you live, your initiative is just a month.
If you go to the website of the Government of India, then the yoga which is this time's syllabus, who is to asana, how to do it, there is a complete description in it.
Look at him, get him in your village, get in your neighborhood, get in your city, in your school, in western offices too.
Start a month from now, see, you will become partner on June 21.
I have read many times that in many offices, yoga and pranayama are collective as soon as they get regularly in the morning, then the whole office's economics increases so much, the entire office changes, environment changes.
Can we use June 21 to bring yoga in our life, can our society bring yoga in life, can you bring yoga to your surroundings
I am going to attend the Chandigarh program this time, on June 21, I am going to do yoga with the people of Chandigarh.
You must also join that day, the whole world is going to do yoga.
You do not stay behind anywhere, this is my request.
Staying healthy is very important for making India healthy.
My dear countrymen, "I'm constantly connecting with you through the talk of the mind."
I gave you a mobile number long ago.
You could hear the "mind" by missed call on it, but now it has made it very easy.
Now to listen to "mind" now only 4 points - missed by him and listen to "mind".
That is the number of four figures - "Nine hundred bye-1922-1922 - Missed call on this number whenever you want, wherever you want, you can listen to "mind".
Dear countrymen, greet you all again.
Don't forget about my water
Will you remember
Okay.
Thank you.
Namaste
.
