Man Ki Bath, my countrymen loved by January 2016.
It's the first 'Man Ki Bath' in 2016.
The 'Man Ki Bath' program wondered how much you'd beat me, what happened to me.
I'd like to tell you what thought comes.
Still I went to Rajghat to pay tribute to the priest Babaji.
Remembering martyrs is the program to be held every year.
In the morning at 11 o'clock in the morning, two minute satisfying the life of the country, the great men who sacrificed life, the martyrs, the young men and the Tapas families have the opportunity to surrender.
But.
We don't think they're anybody in us.
Whether it feels like we should change it naturally.
Our national responsibility seems to be.
I know.
Nothing happens through a 'Man Ki Bath'.
But I thought I was standing.
I didn't even talk to you.
Such feelings give us the inspiration to live for the country.
Think of yourself.
On 30 January everyday 125 crore people of the country sat for two minutes at 11 o'clock .
You can imagine how much power is in this action.
In our scriptures, "Sangchhadav's composition sumo Manasi Jantam."
We'll squeeze all the same.
Run together.
Our feelings are the same.
This is the real power of the country.
This power kills such an accident.
Love my countrymen.
I'm studying the principles of Sander Patell before buying.
I lost my eyes on some things.
One thing in them was very much for me.
Sardar Patel said about Khadhar - India's freedom is in the mortgage.
India's civilization is also expensive.
The pride we considered to be a supreme religion is also in the mortgage.
We look so relieved about the work of farmers in India.
Their welfare is also expensive.
Sardarji had the habit of saying things in a simple language.
Khadi's greatness is well told to him.
On 30 January, I tried to bring the letter to everybody who was tied up with the rural industries of the country, the pilgrimage of worship, Bapuji.
Puja Bapuji was a science bird.
I also tried to reach millions of brothers by using technology.
Clear turned into a symbol now.
A specific existence turned into.
Now the old man is also becoming attractive.
Especially on the complete health care, the symptoms of the nucleus become the best way for those who think.
Looking at the fashion, the moneylender calls himself a special place.
I'm appreciating everybody trying to bring newness to the poor.
In the economy, the seller has a special place for himself.
Along with winning people's minds.
It's unnecessary to keep your place in the girls.
We have many types of clothes.
I told people to have enough clothes even if they had a born.
This thing happens to them now.
That's something.
I don't think there are at least ten types of clothes that can't be expensive.
My words are becoming an adventurous environment in the government.
A lot of money was full of costumes in the previous government.
Regularly it came under the name of modernity.
Our humiliations tied up with the khadi came to be neglectful.
In fact, the man has the power to treat millions of people.
Recently, the railway branch, the police, the Indian boating, the Uttarakhand Tapala branch.
Many such government agencies have taken some good actions to increase the costume.
With these efforts, there was a need to provide 18 lakh work days apart from those who worked in the Khadi area to make necessary clothes.
18 million jobs will be the bigest day before.
Puja Bapuji also used to refer to the technology whenever he wants to grow.
As a result, our routine has developed so much that has reached this level.
In the meantime, roaming the rock using the solar power, adding the solar power to the rotation has become so successful.
This reduces the work, the production grew.
The quality of clothes has increased.
Especially - many letters are coming to me about the work of Rotan running with solar power.
Geetha Devi from Dausa of Rajasthan, Komal Devi.
From Nawada district of Bihar , Sadhana Devi has come to know about the changes in her life due to routine running with solar power in writings written to me .
The attraction of turtle dress was also increased, that your ability was doubled.
All such things give a new excitement.
I'm reminding you once again in this trial reminding the priest of Bapu on January 30.
Look at a couple of dresses in your own.
Let's see its consumers.
Love my countrymen.
We've been celebrating the 26th anniversary, enjoying.
In the midst of what the urges do all around, the people of the country celebrated the Ganeshtra festival by showing courage and guidance.
But some say something differently.
It's done.
I think it's worth looking at them.
Especially Haryana, Gujarat.
There was an incomplete experiment in these two states.
This year, he invited the girls studying most of all for a hundred surrenders on the occasion of Pattakavishan, which was the government schools everywhere.
Like Haryana, the states of Gujarat gave so much respect to the female child.
Vidyabuddhas respected the learned child more specially.
'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' tried to give it a good message.
I appreciate those two states for their imagination.
I'm supposed to appreciate the skirmished girls, the chances of flag holes.
There was another speciality in Haryana too.
In the last week, the families born of female children were honored by sitting in the first line by specially inviting the 26 narratives.
It's a matter of great respect.
I'm glad about this.
Because.
I started the 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' program in Haryana.
The number of women in Haryana is very low.
Social balance threatens to fall.
In this condition, when our officials took Haryana to start the 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhavo' program, our officials gave me.
Not there, there's a lot of opposite atmosphere there.
But I started from there.
But this day, Harriana's great pleasures.
There the number of girls' births grow faster.
I really appreciate that state particularly for the change in social life.
So far, in 'Man Ki Bath', I've proposed two things.
As a citizen, we show so much emotionality in respect of preserving the idols of great men.
But don't hold it later.
Another thing.
How do we suppose to talk about the rights of the people
How to discuss these.
There was a lot of discussion about rights.
There's still going on.
But discuss our ways too.
I'm glad people came forward in many places of the country.
Social organizations have come forward.
The educational institutions have come forward.
Some Sadhu guys have come forward.
Every week the idols, statues, the premises were cleaned there.
A good start.
It's not just a cleaning program.
It's a honour program.
I don't mention everybody.
But I'm feeling so happy to have beautiful news.
Some people imagine to tell out such news.
Everyone recalls that the idol you cleaned by the Magov portal is a photo, or send the photo to the location.
The world's people look at them, hungry.
Likewise, on 26 January, I want people's opinion on responsibility.
Thousands of people made me happy to participate in it.
Love my countrymen.
You need help in one thing.
You believe you must help me.
Talking very much about the farmers in our country.
See a lot.
I don't want to go in that argument.
The farmer has a lot of trouble.
But when the nature's opposites, they're suffering from water.
The cultivation of the crop will grow.
That's the only way to protect them.
It's 'Fusal Bima Yojana'.
In 2016, a big deal given by the Government of India to the farmers is 'Constitution Minister Fasal Bima Yojana'.
Well - Appreciate this path, yeah.
The pursuits of Ooh, not for the appreciation of the Chief Minister.
There's talk of crop beema in these days.
But 20-25 percent of the farmers didn't get lobby because of this.
It didn't reach.
In the next couple, at least 50 percent of the farmers of the country can enjoy the benefits of the beam of the crops.
I need your help in this matter.
Because.
When they arrive at the beach of the crops, it'll be so evening at the time of hardships.
This time there are reasons for getting so much compensation for the Chief Minister's crop beam.
It's so explored, simplify.
Simplified this path.
Join the technology for this.
Not so much.
Even after the fifteen days of the cultivation, I gave you a homicide to help.
I'm supposed to take care of it as soon as it's running through technology.
Keep an eye on all of them.
Nobody would imagine how much the premium paid to the beam of all the crops, maybe it's so low.
The premium to pay the farmers is more than two percent, more than one and a half percent in Rabi.
Tell me now.
Or would my peasant brothers get damaged if they don't take it.
You can't go to farmers.
But I'm listening to it.
You'll bring this thing to the farmers.
I'm asking you to propagate more about this.
So this time I brought you a new approach.
The Prime Minister wants to reach people about the BIMA summit.
This word is now heard by 'Man Ki Bath' in TV, in the radio.
But how do you listen later.
So I'm gonna give you a new line.
You can also hear my 'Man Ki Bath' program in your mobile phone.
Sometimes you can hear.
That's why you're gonna have to give a missed call from your mobile phone.
I'm giving a mobile phone number to hear 'Man Ki Bath'.
If you call Miss D 81908-81908, then you will hear 'Man Ki Bath'.
Now it's in Hindi.
Your mother's language will soon have a chance to hear 'Man Ki Bath'.
That's why I'm planning.
Love my countrymen.
You made miracles.
On the start of the Startup program on January 16, new power, new awareness, new hope and new enthusiasm were found in the country's younger youth.
Lacs of numbers have registered names to participate in this program.
But due to lack of space, this program will be held in the science building of the eye.
You weren't able to reach.
But, you're all on the online.
Perhaps for any program this hour lakhs of youngsters are very impressed.
But it happened.
I first thought it was kind of hope for the startop.
But one thing, startup, that's the only thing about IT, generals think it's an integral act.
After this startop program, all that illusions have disappeared.
Startups in IT are also inclined to countless requirements.
I went to Sikkim a few days ago.
Now Sikkim became the central state.
I invited the country's farming spectators, executives.
I got the chance to meet two young men there.
They're studying in IIM.
One Anurag Agrawal, another Christian.
They crossed the startop one step ahead.
They're called the farm sector in the North-Eastern states.
Working in the field of medicine plants.
They're enhancing completely centrally.
They're selling them worldwide.
And the same Kada.
I told those who worked with the startop range last time.
Let's send the experiences to me in the Narendra Modi app.
Many sent.
I was still happy if I had more.
They're really so inspiring.
Someone was a young man who believed Dwivedi.
He started the kitchen on the online line.
Middle-class, working for daily hunter, is working to send a tiffin through online network verking.
Ankero is Mr. Dignesh Pathak.
He decided to work for farmers, especially animals.
If animals get good food then we get good milk .
If we have funny milk, our youth will be full of energy.
Manoj Gilda, Nikhil.
They started the startop on the farms.
The system of accumulating fruits in classical methods is developing the system of artifacts for agricultural products.
Several such suggestions.
Send information on it to yourself.
I'm fine.
How do you say about clarity, that's why I have to talk about the startup in 'Man Ki Bath' again.
Because your inspiration to us.
Love my countrymen.
Now the beauty of cleanness is mixed.
We're going to express anger on the dirt that's all around.
Yes, the dirt didn't erase.
Now the people of the country have left the discussion on dirt and started talking about cleanliness.
Somewhere, there's work on so much cleanliness.
But now the guys put another front on it.
Connected the beauty of cleanliness.
A way it's like making coffee for gold.
Especially in railway stations it appears.
On the basis of local arts, wall paintings, sign boards are growing well.
They're artistic.
They're also keeping things that make people unpredictable.
And so much more.
I said no one.
Tribal women at Hazaribagh station have completely decorated railway stations in local Sohrai-Kohbar art designs .
More than 300 clean workers in Thane district have been able to get the King Circle Station.
Finally, Borivali, Khar.
There are also many such news coming from Rajasthan here .
Passengers of Sawai Madhopur, fort.
A lot like this.
That's what I think.
Our railway stations have become symbols of our traditions.
When don't find anyone selling tea-pacodi in the window.
Local specificity is known by watching the walls there sitting on the train .
And yet.
It's not the railway department, Narendra Modi's mouth.
It's civilian.
Look.
How do the men take a chicken.
I've got some photos, looking at them.
But if you do anything work with more photos than me, you can send their photos.
Of course, send it.
I see.
People also see.
They inspire more people.
It's possible at the railway station, it's possible at the bus station.
It's possible in the hospital.
Near temples, near churches, it's possible to the mosques.
Parks, in the gardens.
It's so possible.
Those who came to this thought, those who started, who took it all up and appreciated it.
You must send photos only.
I want to see you did.
Love my countrymen.
From 4th to 8th of February, India is giving us hostage to other countries at a big height.
All world countries come to us guests.
Our navigation is making this prestigious, exciting.
Warships of many countries of the world, Navigatory flights arrive at a place near Vishakhapattanam on the shore of Andhra Pradesh.
The International Boating is held on the seashore of India.
This is the only attempt to enable the Indian military power with the world's military power.
A comprehensive sword.
It's a very good chance.
This is such a big program that in the coming days the specialties will show you how through TV, media.
It's prestigious for countries like India.
And the golden age of India's historical history.
The sea in Sanskrit is said to be flourishing, and flowing.
I mean the meaning of an endless prosperity.
The borders can separate us.
Maybe the land can separate, but the water connects us.
Mixing the ocean.
We'll meet ourselves with the sea.
Something can be connected to
Moreover, our ancestors have introduced this power somehow after trading all over the world since centuries.
Chhatrapati may be Shivaji, may be the empire of Chola.
They recognized themselves about the power of the sea.
Nowadays there are living traditions enhanced by sea in many states.
Even today, they're celebrating, playing.
The world knows the power of the navigation if it comes to India very much.
That's a good chance.
I have the ability to participate in this international event.
And in the eastern Kosan Gauhati of the country, the SAARC countries are being celebrated.
Thousands of players from SARC countries are coming to Guwahati.
Sports climate, hopeful conditions.
A Festival for SARC countries' youth.
It takes place in Gauhati in Assam state.
SARC CONTINUES OF THE BANDHISTION OF THE SARC countries.
Love my countrymen.
I said before.
Whatever comes in mind, what I think I'm gonna share with you.
There are 10,12 types of tests in a few days.
In the last 'Man Ki Bath', I told the students some things about the test.
This time it is said - how did the students who have been excited in the tests come without stress, the environment in the family, how did the teachers, teachers help, how did you inform your seniors, how good experiences have passed.
Tell me.
This time we can work a thing
You send your experiences to the Narendra Modi app.
I'm also looking forward to the media.
See in your medium.
Students across the country read them, watch them in TV.
A great medicine to be told in Raya is given to her hand when she's smashing her without stress.
I believe the media friends must be helpful in this matter.
That's it.
They must.
But, when you sent all experiences
Definitely send.
Friends.
Thank you very much.
And once again meet the next month for 'Man Ki Bath'.
