Prime Minister Mr.
Norendra Modi, named Man Ki Bath (Mannth's voice) today morning (25.
Sixty.
2017) I'm supposed to be a coincidence of the conversation in the All India Radics, the people of the country.
The weather changes.
This time the temperature was too much.
But good time, rainy season has arrived in the sight.
The arrival of rains in different parts of the country is sweet and sweet.
After rains, cold winds have been enjoyed by the summer heat in the past.
Whatever places in life, however close it is, in personal life, in public life, the arrival of rain, we can feel a better change in our mindset.
Today people from many parts of the country come to celebrate Lord Jagannath 's Ratya Yatra with great pleasure .
Even in many parts of the world, Lord Jagannath's rathayatra takes place.
Lord joins Jagannath with the immense embrace of the country.
Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambetkar knows well about Baba Saheb Ambetkar that the temple of Lord Jagannath and his tradition should be celebrated very high .
Because, it contains social justice, social equality.
Lord Jagannath is the goddess of sacrifices.
There is a word juggernout in English, which means none can stop it.
It was only when it was seen in Agaradhi, it was known that Jagannath's rathayatra has been formed.
When we see them all, we can understand how the world has accepted this great spirit in all the ways of stay.
On the journey of Lord Jagannath , when all the folks are demonstrating my lives , Lord Jagannath is blessed with sirram in the quarters .
The confrontation of the Indian country is its specialty, its strength is the confrontation of India.
In the sacred Ramlan month all of them celebrated this festival by performing prayers .
Now there's an idea.
In Ramlan's wedding, I'm supposed to demonstrate everybody's merciless life.
The month of the month of Ramlan's sacred attraction, the month of pleasure, how much pleasure we are, that amount of pleasure.
Come on, we all join these sacred plans and enjoy the kingdom of pleasures, proceed on the development path of the meeting.
In this holy month of Ramlan the state of Uttar Pradesh has come to our notice of a great predicament based on the Mubarakpur village of Pizbour .
There only 3500 Muslim brothers live with their families in this small village, in some way there are sisters of Muslim families in large numbers.
The month of Ramlan, the villagers decided to settle the holidays together.
These private toilets are available from the government level, through which only 17 lakh rupees were given to them.
I'll enjoy, this message that I'll make you a surprise, please.
In this sacred month of Ramlan our all Muslim brothers and sisters had reinforced 17 lakh people given to the government .
Not only this, we have also told our spendings, our work, to build our money.
That is why you have to spend this 17 lakh rupees for other facilities of the village .
I appreciate this sacred form of Ramlan to all the villagers of Mubarakpur, for the change of social welfare.
Everything of them is enjoyable.
The biggest thing in this is that they have converted Mubarakpur into an unprecedented cremation ground.
We know that the states of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala have already declared free from the habit of extinction in the open space.
This week Uttarakhand has also been declared as non-productive states .
I'm supposed to see my special gratitude to the administration of these five states, rulers and civilians.
Well, well, in social life, we know that if we have to do something good, we'll have to work hard.
If our handwriting is bad, we'll try to make a lot of time since we're very awake.
That's when it changes physically and mentally.
Like this, some other bad habits are ours.
We're gonna have to make efforts to get rid of these.
We must attract everyone's attention.
We have to remind the possibility of enjoyment again.
I am happy that cleanliness is not standing with the government level today.
It's finished as a movement of people.
Look how much power will come out, how much power will be increased when such people advance with the help of partition.
The most important incident that happened before the last few days came to my notice, I must have conveyed it to you.
This happened in the Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration that was there was a very big participant.
On the 10th day of March, morning from 6th to 14th March, morning till 10th, 100 hours without interruption.
What's the target
In 100 hours, 10,000 households are built in 71 grams of Panchayat.
I'm very happy to convince you that the people of the country, the people and the government have succeeded in building 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages are left out of the habit of excreting .
I am demonstrating greetings for the rulers and government officials, all the villagers of Vijayanagar district.
You're supposed to take care of your hard work, the biggest excitement.
Nowadays there are suggestions from the people for the cheeks of the mind.
Narendra Modi comes in the process, McGov.
Inn (MyGov.
(IN) comes through letters, also through airplane.
Prakash Tribadi has recalled the cycle on the 25th of the month of June as the biggest gap in the history of the populists.
Pragash Tribhadhi appreciates the awareness of the people's vision, not just a constitution, it's a culture.
Eternal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty.
That's what we're paying for freedom, that's to be constantly awake.
That's why we need to remember things that are harmful to the public opinion system.
At the same time we have to go ahead with the good things of the public opinion system.
On the 25th of June, 1975, it's a dark night, no one can easily forget it.
No Indian can leave it away.
In a way, it turned into a prisoner as a slave.
Conversions were ruined with soil.
Including Jaiprakash Narayan, all the prominent leaders of the country were imprisoned in jails.
The jurisdiction is also under the terrible impact of this obstacle.
The newsmen were completely finished.
Students in the world of today's public representatives, all of them are engaged in the efforts to reconstruct the obscure period, and that's how they're busy.
At that time, Atal Bihari Wazbai was also in jail.
Declaration of the state of the country in a decade, Atal wrote a poem, in that verse , in the verse that time, the country's environment was described.
The summer heat of summer humidity of the summer humidity of the humid humid humidity has crossed Oraund and crossed Oraund .
In the Korop bird of the world, the bird named Twiki uier has crossed the bird of Korab , to the first Earth, to the Earth of the world, to the first Earth, sounded somewhere, crossed Oraund, and crossed Oraund.
Wherever you wake up on the way, the people's minds turned up, wherever they wake up on the way, the people were confused, disappeared, turned back, finished, turned back, mankind's fate again, and then went over Oraund.
In the wider country like India, the people who loved the public showed that power by the Assembly, when they got the chance that the masses of people have spread all over the pulse.
The feeling of the people's representative system is our constant tradition.
We have to make this tradition stronger.
My folks, every Indian today feels very glory to stop his head.
On the 21st of June of the year 2017, the world of sweetness is also comfortable.
Everyone from the water to the mountain, in the morning comes through the sun rays, yoga.
Say that no Indian can be a matter of great importance
It is not that yoga was not before, but today everyone joined the work of yoga, Yoga became a bridge connecting the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have turned the opportunity of this yogic achievement into your ability.
More than 4000 people of the United States of the United States have been engaged in yoga practice in the synonymous Machu Bichu, 2400 metres above sea level.
In Haraam of Afghanistan, India offcome, engaged in yoga in the Salma dam, distributed a new technologies to the nectar.
Even in small places like Singapore, programs were organized at 70 places, they did this operation for a single time.
The U.S. Celebration, the International Yoga Day, published 10 patronages.
Yoga Session with Yoga Masters, Yoga scholars were organized in the headquarter of the United Nations Conference.
Working in the United Nations Conference, I.
Representatives from all our countries participated in this.
This time Yoga has been successful in the world again.
In Gujarat Ahmadabad only 55 thousand people have joined together and have created a new world சாதனை.
I've got a chance in Lucknow too.
But for the first time in the rainy season it is also a trick of yoga .
Menus 20, 25, 40 degrees of temperature was also involved in the yoga art of our soldiers.
Everyone has been engaged in yoga exercises with their commitments that our military, extremist security forces, Indian Tibetan Border Guards, Central Reserve Police personnel, Central Industries Protection Force.
This is the third international yoga day .
Some television channels have taken this point forward.
A lot of people sent me smokes, some of them have been mentioned in the Norendra Mody Act.
It is clear that in the present times of the society of awareness about health, if the world continues to talk about yoga, it is clear that we are moving towards the direction of cordiality, from the state of cordiality.
People are beginning to understand that yogic art is very busy.
He's the prime minister, I'm from Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
I'm talking to Sonara.
Sir, at different places, I remember you said in Kerala that instead of giving garlands, we can give good books as a memorial.
This thing has begun as you were the first in Gujarat, but in the midst of these days it does not take place.
Anything can change it
Is there anything we can't do in the way this black is embarrassing.
I had a chance to go to a very popular event in the past.
In Kerala B .
My.
A program has been organized for years by the worker's hearing.
I mean, people should have the habit of studying, studying habits are arranged on the day of reading, the month of study.
I got the chance to start it.
It's said that there are no fountains here, and books are given in me.
It was very fond of me.
I've been reminded of a thing retained from my memory again.
Because if I was in Gujarat, we shouldn't give fountains, we should be given books or if we want to welcome, we have made a way to welcome the handcuff.
That's what we're gonna give the guy's handkerchief, because it's supposed to be emotional.
If I had been in Gujarat, it would have changed, but after I came from there, this habit is gone.
But when I went to Kerala, I'd have a caution again.
I'm telling someone who works in the king now, start this practice.
We can also gradually make it a natural form.
The garlic doesn't last long.
Once we get in hand, we keep it away.
But when we give books, in a way it becomes a part of the house, the family becomes a member.
We can also welcome the gates, so how many companions are helpful
Deficiency of costs, uses properly.
These things have a lot of importance of historical importance.
When I went to England last year, the queen Elizabeth maiden of England brought me to London.
There was a maternal atmosphere.
He fed me with very love, and then he showed a little clerk handkerchief with great respect.
He illuminated a light in his eyes, when I was married, he convinced Gandhians who tested this handkerchief.
Years have passed, but Elizabeth queen, Gandhi's tested handkerchief was preserved.
When he saw me, he enjoyed, showed it to me.
If I was watching it, I knew he wanted it I wanted to touch it.
A great lover of Gandhiji is a part of his life, a part of his history.
These habits don't change to night.
If you talk like this, you'll have to be guaranteed.
In the same way, you're gonna have to be involved in such conversations, try.
For this, when I go somewhere, I won't repeat that if someone brings garland, I can't do that.
We're gonna have a change, gradually, we're gonna have to repeat.
There are many folks in the form of the people of the country, the Prime Minister of the country.
Even if you want to be covered in anger, I'm making a habit.
I mean, reading something in the letters coming to me, I'm building a chance to connect me with the common people.
Several types of letters come, many people write letters to me.
I'm sure I need to share a letter I read a few days ago.
Till the southern Tamilnadu , the monument of Madurai .
A letter has been written to me by the devotional word Sarvanna.
My children's education spendings, etc. in mind, I can enjoy me in any activity of paying, so that the family's economic conditions will grow.
That's why I'm starting the work of buying some things from the market, getting money from the bank, according to the Mutra project.
In the meantime, the Government of India, E-Marketplace, was focused on the formation of a government glass.
After seeing something about it, I'm recording myself in it.
If you get the chance, I'm asking you to go to E-GE MTU in comparison.
It's a new kind of structure.
Whoever wants to give something to the government - electric toothbrushes, huts, wipes, chairs, tables, they can record themselves in this territory.
Let's note what goods he has, what the price he can sell.
And the government departments must go to this gallery and see who pays cheap and cheap goods to buy things.
It has a condition without intermediaries.
All kinds of symptoms of light shine .
Interface, there's no interface, everything happens through technology.
All the departments of the government come to take care of who's booking in E-GEM.
Due to lack of intermediaries things are available at cheap prices .
They have recorded this inconvenience now that what can be given by themselves.
The letter he wrote was very comfortable.
I've got loan through the Mutra project, I've been starting to do business, after giving all the information about what I can do through E-GEM, I've got an order from the Prime Minister's Office.
It's just a new message to me in the meantime.
When I thought what the Prime Minister had bought at the office, he wrote that he had bought two thermos plastics at the Prime Minister's Office.
It's also said that I got 1600 rupees.
This is empowerment, authority.
This is the possibility of encouraging business.
If they say they didn't write me a letter, it couldn't have reached me.
Through E-GEM, a non-constituent from remote India is doing a small business, he has to buy the goods to the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country.
There is also visuality in it, which has power, in which there is an industrial emblem.
Government E-Marketplace-GEM.
Whoever government wants to sell their belongings, I want them all to record themselves in this comprehensive level.
It's an excellent specimen for at least the government, most of the rulers.
What's the point of this
At least the price, the more simple, the ability and the visuality.
My folks, we're gonna take care of yoga, as well as the missions we've made in space science are shining our hearts.
It is the greatest significance of India that when our shoes are lying on the earth connected with yoga, we are thrilling dreams that we are going away.
In the past, sports and scientific significance have shown India's greatest achievement.
Today, India is not only on Earth but also on its own.
Two days ago, the Indian Space Research Institute, ISRO Institute, with Cartosat-2, has been successful in implementing 30 Nano artifacts.
In these artifacts, apart from India, only 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America are available.
This Nano artificial operation of India will be very helpful in getting information related to agriculture and natural resources.
A few days ago, ISRO Institute G.
I'm sure SAT-19 was successfully passed by the artificial cell.
So far, in all the artificial plans of India, this is the most weighted artifact.
You can imagine how great our scientists have done in the field of space, since our country's newspapers have compared it to the weight of the elephant.
It's been possible for 1000 days by sending artifacts to Margah on the 19th of June.
You knew that the margai grave made a successful rotation to send us artificial cells.
Its age is only 6 months, but it has been working for six months due to the viability of our scientists.
Now it's been working for 1000 days, sending smoke, sending information, deleting scientific data.
Thanks to the limits of time, passing all his lifetime, it's specially included.
In our scientific journey to spend 1000 days, an important miles in our travel.
Nowadays in the field of sports we can see our youngsters becoming more advanced .
Besides education, they come to realize that they have their future in the field of sports.
Our sportsmen, their efforts, their achievements, etc. have been proud of the country.
At the same time, Kitambi Srikanth, a pedestrian sporter of India, has gained the propaganda of the country by winning Indonesia Open.
I'm supposed to demonstrate my heart-breaking lives to him and his dad.
Perhaps swimming.
T.
I had the chance to participate in Usha's Usha festival school, opening the artificial slope a few days ago.
Sports, sports.
That's why we have to imagine the games.
Sports in Membat are very important.
There's no Pancham for the skills of the country.
If the kids were engaged in the field of sports in our family, we should give them the chance.
You don't want them to step away from the field, put them in the room and learn.
He's reading, so he's gonna make progress too.
But if he has a lot of skills in the game, interest, school, college, family, everyone wants to imagine him.
Everyone has to dream of the next team.
Once again, the people of the country, the rainy season, the continuation, have been the time to create new kinds of experiences.
Once again, I'm supposed to demonstrate my life to all of you, I'm connecting you to the next hole.
I'm sorry.
