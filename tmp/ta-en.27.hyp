Prime Minister Mr.
Narendra Modi today in the All India Radio (27.
11.
2016) In the morning, the conversation of Manki Bath's speech, "Every folks, please.
We enjoy celebrating Diwali in the last few months.
Like every year, during Deepavali, I once again went to the borders of China, celebrating Deepavali with the warriors.
ITCBP, along with Indian Tibetan extremists, military warriors, I celebrated Dipavali in the peaks of the Himalayas.
I'm going every time, but the experience of this Deepavali is absurd.
125 crore people of the country have dedicated this Deepavali to the protective soldiers, whose influence has been published by every security guard there.
They were filled with feelings.
Not only this, the messages sent to me by the people of the country, which they shared the country's security forces in their joys are a miraculous reference.
People didn't send only information, connected with the mind.
Someone wrote poems, others made pictures, others created cartoons, another video.
That is, everybody's like the residing places.
When you see the letters, I'm gonna know how many people have the imagination potential, how many feelings.
After seeing all these, I found a thought in MyGov that I could form a coffee table book by picking some of these.
Its work is going on, through the partition of all of you, your imagination about the feelings of the soldiers of the country, your emotions about the country's security forces will be found in this segment.
A warrior of the army wrote to me: The Prime Minister, the soldiers, all of us, like Dipawali, Holi, go to the border.
Every moment we spend only on the ideas of the country's security.
Yeah, well, there's a feeling about home in the wedding days.
But if you want to tell the truth, you don't have to think like this.
I don't think we're not in the house anymore.
Something, together with 125 crores of Indians, we felt that we were celebrating Dipavali.
My folks.
During this Deepavali festival, in our country's security forces, the survivors feel swollen in their minds, don't you want to disappear with some கணs
As we, as a community, in the way of nation, this feeling should be ourselves, that I'm gonna order all of you to join our feelings.
Well, even if there's any fair, well, comfortable, well, we must remember the soldiers of our country in some way.
It is sure that when the whole country stands on the shoulders with the soldier's skin, the strength of the army will increase by 125 crores.
Some time ago all the leaders of the villages of Jammu Kashmir had come to meet me.
They belong to the Panchayat community of Jammu Kashmir.
Kashmirab had come from different villages of valley .
There were only 40-50 leaders.
I had a chance to talk to him for a nice time.
They're talking about some things related to the development of their villages, some came with some joys, but when the conversation began to length, the environment of the valley, the law-condition, the future of the children, it was natural that different things were found in it.
With rich love, open mind, these heads of the village are touched by the heart.
When the talk about schools burnt in Kashmir, when we got up, our folks felt so much sorry about it, as it was felt that these village leaders were also there.
They believed schools weren't burnt, the future of the kids was dumped.
I would like you to pay attention to the future of these kids after you returned to your gatherings.
I am very happy that all these leaders who came from the Kashmir Valley fulfilled the promise given to me very specially .
They made aware of those who were far away from the villages.
A few days ago, 95 percent of the kids of Kashmir participated in this voluntary exam.
In the virtual examinations, such a large number of student students are participating in the J . K . K . for our prosperous future of our children, through education, the new peaks of development have been pouring stress.
At the same time, I will convey my lives to those students for their incentives, my parents, relatives, their teachers, all the village leaders, and all the hearts of life.
Love many sisters, this time when I seek advice from people for the hoove of the mind, the advice of all came about a thing.
Everyone asks me about 500,000 rupees of boots and I have to speak in a broad way.
On the 8th day of November, at 8th night, the people of the country spoke about the beginning of a change in the country.
When I made this decision, you put it before you, then this conclusion wasn't normal, I'd say it was generally a matter of trouble.
But how important the decision is, the same thing is important to do it.
I'm sure we're gonna have to face many kinds of new difficulties in our average life.
Even then, this conclusion was the biggest, that we'll be 50 days to come from the effect of this.
After that, we can keep ourselves down to the specific condition.
It's not so easy to try to get rid of those diseases that we've been finishing all my diseases for 70 years.
I can understand all the difficulties you meet.
But if I see your support, if you see your competitiveness, give you all the efforts to squeeze and steal your direction, you understand this true path well, you know that the folk health has accepted this thing.
500 and 1000 rupees, so many big nations, so many million crores of natives, such decisions - the world of slaughter is also being taken care of very well, every economic expert has been imagining it very much.
The whole world is keeping in mind that 125 crore people of Hindustan will also succeed in surviving places .
Maybe the world's minds might be questioned
For India, 125 crore people of India have a unique belief, 125 crore people have a surety about the level of their conscience.
The reason for this is the citizens of our country, whose reason you are, this success path is also possible for your reasons, if our country shines all kinds of gold.
All the departments of central governments, state governments, regional institutions, one lakh 30,000 bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than nine lakhs of milk offices, more than one lakh bank princes, more than nine lakhs, have participated in this work during the night, immigration.
In the midst of various pressures, they've all been very peaceful, inclined to make this folk patriot a mistake, an important change, an effort to complete it.
Start in the morning, don't even know when you finish the night, but everyone does.
As a result of this, it is clear that India will be successful in this work.
I've seen that everybody is involved in all these problems, banks and dapa offices.
When the matter of human love comes, they're only traveling more and more.
Someone told me that at the place named Khandwa, an old man was worried.
Suddenly the money was needed.
I'm glad to know that when the bank staff arrived there took care of this thing, he went to the old man in time and mixed the money and saw no trouble for the treatment.
Many such countless events are available every day in TV, publications, messages, conversations.
I'm demonstrating my heartfelt thanks to all the companions who work in this great valve.
It's the real power that's when you see it.
I remember that when the Chief Minister's plan was going on in full swing, how bank workers slaughtered it on their shoulders, 70 years of unbelievable work.
They showed their skills then.
Today, once again, they have fought the same kind of word, 125 crore people's mindset, everybody's social attitude, I have full faith in making this nation a new power.
But whatever kind of harm is spread, even today some of them have a habit of priorities.
Even now, this money, this black money, countless money, this money, pinamip money, etc. can trace a way to life.
They're looking for legal relevant actions to protect your money.
I'm sorry that they've chosen a way to use dresses.
You're trying to save your money, buy some work from them, hungry, funny words, funny words or heartbeats.
The way I want to say to those people today is the only one... if you're quiet, if you're not satisfied, you're not going to follow the law, you'll see what you're gonna do.
But please don't play with the lives of cattle.
Records come in the name of the furnace, then don't do my favorite treachery in the case of your wrestling.
There is a very strict law in relation to pinamic properties, which comes to them, which has a lot of problems.
The government wants us not to suffer any kind of folks.
Ashish, who belonged to Madhya Pradesh, conveyed to me through phone about the war that was touched by 500, 000 rupees of bonds and against black money, appreciated it - I'm sorry, my name is Ashish Pare.
I am staying in Dirali village of Tirali Daluka situated in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
It's appreciable that you're going to remove the coins of guys worth 500,000.
Besides many immortalities, people have supported this terrible effort for the development of the country that you want to demonstrate in the church of mind through many examples.
It's very important for people to grow in a way of enthusiasm, in the work of nation-making, I'm singing with a sweet country, saying that you're giving me great pleasure to get rid of these 500,000 rupees.
Similarly, Ellappa Vellankar, a member of Karnataka, had also confessed to himself - Motiji, I speak from a village of Koppal district of Karnataka.
I'd like you to convince my psychologists, because, you said you'd be a good day for yourself.
But nobody expects that you'll take such a big effort.
You've got a good sport to those who pay black money through 500 and 1000 rupees of bonds.
If this action has not been taken, every dweller of India will never have a good time.
That's why I'd like to indicate you my favorite thanks.
Increasing enthusiasm to accompany some things through public, public, from government levels.
There is so much joy and greatness when it comes to know what is a miraculous capacity to the Commonwealth of my country.
There is a restaurant at National Highway 6 in Akola of Maharashtra.
They've placed a very big information.
Even if you're old, you don't want to eat, don't worry about money, don't just go back with hungry from here, you have to go out of food, if you want to travel on this road, certainly pay the money.
There people go, eat food, after 2-4-6 days, when they travel through that, they pay back the money.
This is the power of my country, in which service is illuminated, devotion, etc.
During the decade, when I used to talk to tea, this idea spread all over the world.
Many folks in the world have started telling you about tea.
But I didn't know that even marriages were going on when this tea was talking.
On the 17th of November, a marriage held in Surat, had a conversation with tea.
In the summer of Gujarat, a woman who came to her household gave only tea to drink, did not get involved in any other duties, no breeding, because there was money due to coincidence.
The villagers also believed that this is the pride.
The Bharat Maru and Taksha Parmar of Surat - they have driven up their sympathy in a very big way against black money, against their mischief by their marriage.
In the same way, when the newborns and the dakshas are supposed to be virtuous, I'm demonstrating you with the life of a new possibilities to absorb it.
When such confluences come, people make their solutions very special.
Once we returned home late, we could have seen the TV once.
There is a small village named Tekiya Juli of Assam state .
Tea is a gardener, he gets a sword on the basis of warrior.
What did they do when they got the boot of 2000 now
The four women of the surroundings gathered together, the wealth went and bought the goods, paid by 2000 rupees, they didn't need low-valuation coins, because we bought things together, we'd meet next week, and then we'd be able to see the terms.
People are pilgriming problems within you.
Take care of the change in it.
A for our part.
T.
M.
Get the mike that the government got information about the gardening workers of the Assamese tea, see how many changes occur in rural people's life.
Some have got immediate benefits through this operation.
It's the best time for the country, but some people are very happy.
When I asked about the happening, I got some information from small towns.
I have received information about only 40-50 cities, due to the removal of these coins, old baggies, all the taxpayers - you know better about those who don't pay taxes on water , electrical orders and taxes.
The power makers, who are supposed to be the skulls of law, no one asks them, they don't pay the money.
They're baked up in counts.
Every municipality attracts 50 percent of the population very distressed.
But this time, because of this decision on the 8th day, everyone came to pay their old dogs.
In the last year of 47 city units, only 3,000-3,500 crore rupees were deposited in this period.
You can also enjoy surprise and enjoyment that only 13,000 crores of rupees are available in this weekend.
Where's 3000-3500 crores, where's 13,000 crores
They're also coming straight.
Now, when these municipalities have four times the money, if there are drainage systems for poor people, water supply systems are created, the Anganawadi centers will be established, isn't it really possible
There are many such specimens that have occurred in the eyes of direct benefits.
Brothers, our villages, our farmers, are the strong pillars of our country's economics.
On one side, because of this new change of economics, every drunken person comes to work on himself.
But I want my country's farmers to explain my deeds specially today.
Now I've been discussing the data related to this season.
I don't expect to be honey, pulses, oil products, till the 20th of November, compared to this period last year, seeds have increased.
In the midst of trouble, the farmers have found a way out.
The government has also made several important decisions, in which the farmers and the villages are also important.
Even after that there are hardships, even though natural places, our farmer, who surely combines them with any intensity, has fought this process with tension.
Small traders of our country provide jobs and improve economic activity.
We made an important end in the last commencement plan report
Like big males, small shops in villages can also trade 24 hours, no law prohibits them.
Because, when the big malls get the chance to open all 24 hours, why don't they get such a chance
According to the Mudra project, they were taken as treasury .
According to several crores of rupees according to the Mutra project simple people were given, because in such small industries millions of people are engaged, many lakhs of crores of rupees give the speed of trade.
But because of this decision, it's natural that they're suffering.
In such a situation, these small traders could also be seen by technology, through mobile app, through mobile bank, through the lease of debt, by your own methods, as well as on the basis of confidence.
Today, whenever I want to tell my little business brothers sisters, you use it for a chance to enter the digital world.
You can also pack the bank's ap through your mobile phone.
Put the instrument of Point of Sale for the sale of garments and harvests.
Learn how you do business without dealing with a lot of money.
As big malls enhance your business using technology, a small businessman, a simple facilitator can enhance his business through the natural technology.
There's no need to laugh in it, it's important life.
You can be the biggest participant to create a society without a huge wealth, you can use all the bank actions through your business, mobile phones, today we can carry business in many ways.
Technologies are safe, quick.
I just want you to give your support to get rid of this operation.
Not only this, I hope you're gonna take the change to the head, you can give such a head to you.
I hope you can take the business of the slum village with the help of this technology.
I'd like to say in the older brothers, that's what you've got more indispensable.
One of the prescriptions mentioned in the paper, the status of the population given in your hands is another.
Whenever there is a total surveillance in hand, a man standing outside, he has to give a slave from his own righteousness, he's supposed to be a humble businessman who lives in such a lifetime.
Through this new procedure, an agreement has begun for you in the banks, your nurturing population should be included in your bank account, following the method of at least enforcement.
You'll have to get your finish, no one has to give a share.
Don't let yourself work on you.
If your bank is mixed up in cash, you can also buy things in a small mobile phone, through which you can pay the money.
It doesn't need any smart to go, even now your mobile goes as E-Wellet.
That's why my caretaker brothers and sisters, I'm specializing your partition in this scheme, because I'm doing this a big end for the harvests of the country, for the farmers, for the businessmen, for those who renounce the rights, for those suffering, to get the benefits.
Today I want to talk specially to the youth.
In India 65 percent of the people are 35 years old , they are getting dandruff all over the world .
I'm sorry that you're the young men of mine, the youngsters, the result I've taken you.
I know that you're fully awakening this end.
I also knew that it's been making a big difference to go ahead in artificial ways.
Guys, you're my real cigarettes, you're my real guy.
A wonderful opportunity to serve the Mother Bharat Mata is available to all of us, which is the golden opportunity to lead the country towards economic peaks.
My young social friends, can you help me
I don't get the job done with the help of me.
You don't have the previous television, the quantity you have about today's world practice.
Why, even in your family, your elder brother, your grandfather, your father, the sensible pupils may not have your experience.
App, that's actually what you're gonna know, online bagging, that you know what is bankrupt by the aunt, travel ticket booking etc.
These things are very easy for you, you're using them.
But today the great job of doing the country, we don't have a wealthy wealthy wealth.
It's okay that it's impossible to be a society of hundred percent of the poor alteration.
But why shouldn't we use India as a beginning of society using less roots.
Once you start using this lesser societal, the target of a society without a lot of reversal will not be far away.
I need your physical help in this matter, your time, your confirmation.
I'm sure you're never gonna let me do it.
Because, we all want to change the life of the evil of the Hindustan.
You know how many possibilities have been introducing the digital bank service or the mobile bank service introducing the society without much money supply.
Every bank provides online facility.
Every bank in India has a prime mobile ap, each bank has a special volt.
Valt's straightforward object e-purse.
Several types of hips are available.
According to his plan, there is a rope basket for millions of poor families of India, which has been used at least, after the 8th, it has become more useful, has seen a growth of 300 percent.
Like the prepaid leaf coming in mobile phones, banks also get prepaid leaf to spend money.
A nearby library UPI to trade, through which you can buy things, send money, get money.
It's easier to send you information on this work.
Those who don't know how to send the information on the WattsApp today, how to make a forward.
Not only this, the big smart phone for this job is very easy technology for all non-necessary.
With simple comforts, money can also be traced through the phone.
It can be used without any difficulty even if the businessman, vegetable seller, milk seller, newspaper seller, tea seller, seller.
I'm putting pressure on this method to make more smooth efforts.
All the banks are engaged in it, doing it.
Now we've sold online more options for the world.
And, with the idea of a non-communicable society, we've come to the conclusion of such ropes, which you may have seen in the last two-four days.
My young friends, even after all this, it's obvious to complete a television.
I'm sure you're all attached to this great work.
I'm paying attention to whatsApple confrontational messages that you give, angers, poems, pieces, cartoons, new imaginations, joy.
When I look at the creation of our younger communities between the swords, it is as if the poet was born at a time in the battlefield, as the subject of this Indian soil, I've seen you appear to be an original resistance when we meet this much bigger.
But my dear little guys, I'm telling you once again, I need your help in this work.
Yeah, yeah, I'm telling you once again, I hope you need your help, millions of young people of this country will do this job.
Please confirm that you're a part of a society without abundance.
Get all the techniques of spending your mobile phone online.
Not only this, every half an hour, an hour, two hours, how much time can you give, at least 10 families, how to use this technique, how to pay the Ap of your bank, how to pay the money on your bank account, how can the marketers pay.
Also keep in mind how the market can do business in this way .
You have to take the lead from the unemployed community, the drive from the nets, the drive to release them, to free the black money, to freedom from the problems of the people of the places.
Once you learn how the use of the Rupee leaf is to you, you're supposed to give you hope.
If you have learned these methods for ordinary dwellers, you can get rid of all worry, then all the youths of Hindustan are involved in this work, I know that it will not take longer to do this.
Within a month, we can stand in a new Hindustan, you can do this by your mobile phone.
Go to ten houses everyday , mix 10 houses in it everyday .
Come on, let's call you, let's just go with your support, let's change this transformation, make changes.
We will emerge in this war that liberates the country from black money, nuisance etc.
Young people are the world's transformed nations.
We must accept whoever brings change, whoever is now, whoever revolutions, whoever he lives.
As Kenya sword accepted, a mobile structure called M-PESA was primarily used, called M-PESA.
Today in this area of approximately Africa all the symptoms of Kenya have been prepared by it .
This country has created a great revolution.
My hearty youths, I'm asking you once again, once again, you go ahead with this operation.
Every school, college, university, national pupil, folk health plan, in a society, in a different way, will invite all of you to this work.
We're gonna take this job forward.
We all have a chance to serve the country with the most sweet service, don't let this canyon break the golden face.
My younger brothers, a great poet of the country, Harrivansh Rai Bachchan's birthday today.
Harivashraya's birthday today, Amidab Bachan has given him a message of sanitation.
The artist of this century, Amidap, who would like you, would have taken care of the purifying path ahead.
It seems as if the matter of satisfaction has spread all over his nerves.
That's why he remembers cleanliness even on his father's birthday.
Harivansh Rai, writing only the verse of one of his poems, says, "The body of the immersion, the deepest mentality, my life, my identity.
Harivansh Rai identified himself through this sequence.
The surviving body, the deepest mentality, the longest life of humor, is my identification, and his nearest son Amitap writes that he is my identity, a pure body, a pure mind, a pure India.
I'm supposed to see Harivansh Rai with my honor.
I'm honoring my thanks to go ahead with the sacred work, to join them in the hole of the mind like this.
My funny folks, now your thoughts, your feelings, your letters, myGov and narendramodiap keep me consistently connecting with you.
Now, at 11 o'clock, Man Kei Bath is sounding, but in state languages, it'll start immediately after it's over.
I'm gonna thank them for the all-India radioactivists to do this.
No matter how many English languages are in jeopardy, my people there will get the chance to get involved with it.
Thank you for everyone.
.
