"Man Ki Bath" June 2018 Namaskar
My favorite patriot, I've got the privilege of telling you all the grave by the 'Man Ki Bath' program for a second time.
A few days ago, there was a historic cricket match in Bangalore.
I understand you're talking about the Test Match between India-Afghanistan tricks.
This is the first international match to Afghanistan.
That match is a matter of honor for every Indian to be with our Indian team.
Two groups also played so shiny games.
Afghanistan's bowler Rashid Khan came this time.
P.
In El, the cooda showed a nice talent.
I remember writing in his towitch while tyaging me that Afghanistan President Mr. Ashraf Ghani said, "Afghanistan people are so proud of their Hero Rashid Khan."
To give these sportsmen a platform to see their talent, Ganu is blessed with our Indian friends.
Afghanistan's best talent to the tribunal.
Cricket world's property.
Afghanistan President Sarda also said, "Rashid is not going to give anyone to us."
This match will remember us so much.
It must remember so the first match but I remember only because of another thing.
Yavath did a special work of the world to stand for an example.
The Indian team did the same thing to do what the team was standing at the time of taking the trophy.
When taking the trophy, the Indian team first invited the team of Afghanistan who played the match and took the trophy together.
That's what we can know through this incident.
To unite society, to discover the talents of our youth, to discover them, the games are a shining way.
I appreciate both the joints of Afghanistan, India.
Even in the future, we hope to play together with each other.
Even play.
My favorite patriot, on the 21st of June, the Fourth International Yoga Day celebrations narrate a bright sight.
Yavat's world has been seen together.
People worldwide have practiced yoga with so much fun.
In front of the European parlment in Brussels, at the headquarters of the ICC Committee located in New York, in the warships of the Japanese boat, all the places have also been seen doing yoga.
For the first time in Saundi Arabia there was a historical program of Yoga .
I said that many kinds of yogas were seen by women.
Even in the high snow peaks of Ladakh , Chinese soldiers organized yoga together .
Yog spoils all the borders, everybody falls.
Thousands of excited people in hundreds of countries have converted this festival into a big festival by forgetting all the differences of caste, religion, region, ligament.
The Yoga Day celebration is so excited that people of the world are so excited, and why do not our country celebrate it with double enthusiasm.
Our country's security forces, in the water, on the Earth, around 125 crores of people performing three chotla yoga in the sky.
Some virgins perform yoga in the waterfalls, some used yoga in the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our soldiers of the Vaimana group roamed everyone by wearing yogasanas from a height of fifteen thousand feet on earth in the sky .
Besides sitting in the plane, the sight of seeing yogasana floating in the air.
Schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings, playgrounds all took place.
A vision of Ahmadabad was only harmed.
There are around 750 elder brothers and sisters who have created a world record by doing yoga at one place.
To cross the climate, religion and geography, yogas worked to unite the people of the world.
We have been convinced of the feeling that our men, princes, sages have ever been saying.
Yogha looked at that feeling right.
Now the health has become an activity.
I'm hoping this propaganda is going on in advance with the practice of yoga .
Most of the people participate in their lives .
In my favorite patriots, mygogue, Narendra Modi's app, this time many people told me about Julie on the one-th day Dr. Daughter in Man Ki Bath.
Good complication.
We'll go to the doctor as soon as it's difficult.
But that day our country is going to celebrate the physicians.
For the service of the people of society , Ganu is the most compassionate .
We are the ones who worship Mother as God.
I think Mother is equal to God.
Because Mother is born to us.
If you give birth to your mother, the doctor gives us regeneration.
The doctor's role is not lost just by reducing the diseases.
The family's friend like a doctor.
They not only cure but also heal food guides in our lifestyle.
Now with medical advice on therapists, the general lifestyle methods can show any impact on our health are deep awareness and experience on things.
Indian doctors have identified themselves in the world with their ability, more skills.
Our Indian doctors have come to the conclusion of the problem of clever medical along with the competition , industry staying in the medical profession .
Through the medium of Manki Bath, I'm telling you many expressions during the 'Doctors Day' on July 1st of our medical friends coming to all the nation's public.
My favorite patriot, we're so lucky to be born on this Bharata land.
There is no one day, no month, no historical event in our history of India.
Every region in India has its own heritage .
Somebody who was tied up with that place, a great man, a well-known man, has given his association to those places.
Give me greatness.
"Good minister, greeting
I do.
I'm talking to Surendra Misra.
You know you're coming to Maghar on June 28.
I live in Tadwa, a small village of Gorakhpur along with Maghar.
There is a combination of Kabir in Maghar.
Kabir is respected by the people here as a person associated with social harmony.
There are discussions on Kabir's feelings everywhere.
You're doing programmes showing so much impact on all sections of society.
Please wait for you to tell us about the more programs that the government is operating.
"Thank you a lot for calling.
On the 28th day I'm really coming to Maghar.
The Kabirwood of Gujarat will tell you.
In the Kabir Wad of Gujarat, when I worked, the Satpura took a national conference with some people who played the Kabir tradition.
Why did Kabir Das go to Maghar
When he died in Maghar, he had a belief to reach heaven.
It was believed that he would go to heaven only after he sacrificed himself in Kashi.
Maghar was watching unconscious.
Saturish Kabir Das didn't believe it.
He tried to preserve all the faiths and mischiefs in his lifetime.
That's why he went to Maghar and died there.
Kabi Das empowered social equality, peace, harmony by his writings, scriptures.
That's his idea.
This is what we see in his writings.
Even this time they are inspired by us.
One of his writings is Kabir Soye Peer Hai, Joe Jane Par Peerson Peer on Janehi, So Kaa Peer May Peer, the true fond of understanding the suffering of the witnesses.
Unable to understand the sadness of the others.
Kabir Das showed special attention to social unity.
He used to think more about the future than his time.
He gave a message of peace and harmony during the period of unbalanced, confrontation.
People tried to end the obligation by uniting the minds.
ug May Bair Koi Nahi, John Sheetal Hoyeh with Apa Daldey, Daya Kare Sab Koymro composition says - "Jaha Daya Taha Dharm Hai, Jaha Lobh Taha Papjah Krodh Taha Call Hai, Jaha Asha Taha Ap Ayan said at the other side, "" So he hunted the people to ignore the pride of the privileged humans on the basis of knowledge.
Even after centuries, his words are effective forever.
Now we think he's talking about the same knowledge age as he hears his story.
He asked the people to calculate human beings on the basis of knowledge, forget them.
Even after centuries, his words are effective forever.
Now we think he's talking about the same knowledge age as he hears his story.
So we're talking about Satpura Kabir, so I know another folk he wrote.
In that, he thinks that the greatness of Govind Dou Khande, Kak Lagu Piblihari Guru Appne, Govind Dio Batayguru Taluku is such.
Such a Guru is another - Jagadguru - Bhagwan Guru Nanak .
He's the god who watched the streets of millions of people.
There have been centuries of inspiration.
The Lord of Guru Nanak taught to set up caste obligations in society, to embrace Yavath mankind together.
They say that the serving of immortality is our service to the Lord.
They did the work of society where they went.
A cooking room was built for social obstacles.
There people from every species, kul, mother, sect can come and cook.
Lord Guru Nanak started this lung system.
In 2019 we celebrate the 550th Jayanti festival of Lord Guru Nanak .
I'd like to participate in this festival with all our enjoyment.
New ideas, new instructions, new ideas on how to celebrate this 550th Jayanti festival of Guru Nanak's Yogi Samaj, how to celebrate the Yavat world, make us think, make right arrangements.
Together with great respect we make this festival celebrated as an inspirational festival .
My favorite countrymen, the country's independence is very big.
Very extensive.
It's deep.
It's a combination full of balloons of Lekhlen.
There's a history that is tied up with Punjab.
Jalianwala Bagh, who was headed by Yawat humanity, was accidentally completed in 2019.
Who forgot that dark day of 1919, April 13
The day of the rain of gunfire on the innocent, innocent, innocent people crossing all the armed forces with power abuse.
These events are going to be completed.
We all think of how to remember such a day.
We must remember only the martyrdom of this incident.
With violence, with graveness, this event promises that no problem will ever be solved.
Always the victory of peace, pride, sacrifice, sacrifice.
Dr. Shyam Prasad Mukherjee was born on the 6th day of the new Julie Julie, Shri Raman Kumar Narendra Modi Aap of Rohini in Delhi, so he asked for the public about Dr. Shyam Prasad Mukherjee by the Manki Bath program.
Raman Garu, thank you many before.
Enjoying seeing your interest on the history of India.
You'll have to know.
He's been repeated yesterday on June 23.
Dr. Shyam Prasad Mukherji is tied up with many things.
But they have the most favourite things of education, administration, parlmentary behavior.
Only a few people know that Vais Chansler, a very young man, who was a vice-chancellor of Kolkata University.
His age is only 33 slopes when wise sensual.
Doctor.
On the invitation of Shyam Prasad Mukharji , Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore in 1937 addressed the University Graduation of Calcutta in Wong language very few people know this .
During the British regime, the first time to communicate in the language of the University of Calcutta.
Doctor from 1947 to 1950.
Shyam Prasad Mukherjee is the first industrial minister of India .
In a way, Mukherji has given the powerful award to the industrial progress of India.
He made a strong platform by putting a strong foundation on the industrial growth of India.
In 1948, the first industrial system of independent India, his thoughts, he came from a darshanic position.
Dr. Mukherjee's dream of being rich, empowered, prosperous, prosperous in every field of India.
India has established big industries, along with MSMEs, dresses, dresses, cottage industries, and their desire to fully enhance them, to provide financial support, institutions, for them all India handicrafts board, All India Handloom Board, Khadi Rehabi Village Industries Board etc.
Dr . Mukherjee also paid special attention to the nationalisation of India 's protection product Taluku .
Chittaranjan Locomotive Works Corps, Hindustan Aircraft Corps, Sindri's Red Corps, Damodar Valley Corporation - These four most successful projects.
Dr . Shyam Prasad is also the biggest support of Mukherji in the establishment of the wet River Valley Project .
He had a lot to develop West Bengal.
A part of Bengal was saved only by his thought, vision, action.
That part of India is the reason for him.
India's comprehensive, significance - both of them are the most important elements.
At the young age of 52 people they had to lose their lives .
Come on, we all remember the message of Dr. Shyam Prasad Mukherji's Ikta, with the positive, graceful feelings, united with the omnipotents for India's growth.
My dear patriot, in the last few weeks, I got a chance to speak to those who were observed by various schemes introduced by the government through video calls.
Whatever changes in the lives of people crossing the scope of the files, they have the chance to hear.
People say about their competitors, their grievances, their facilities.
It's not just a government program for me.
I experience to learn this particularly.
This program showed me happiness in the face of people.
What are the enjoyable moments in any life
The stories of ordinary people , the stories of their experiences , my heart fail.
Through the medium of the Common Services Centre for the desert villages everything is available till the service of creating adult pension from the village to the park .
A brother of the Chattis gud is making ice cream with the steam fruits.
As soon as the Anjana Prakash in Jharkhand, millions of young people of the country are transporting medicines to the nearby villages along with running the medicine centers.
A young man from West Bengal, who is looking for two-three jobs, is now making his business successful.
Besides, ten-fifteen people are giving jobs to you.
Students in schools of Tamil Nadu , Punjab , Goa are working to focus on the important elements like enterprise in the school of Tinkering Lab at their young age.
There are other stories like this.
People don't have anywhere in the country without telling Taluko's victory.
The whole of this program is a matter of joy for me to achieve the victory of most common people than the government.
This is the power of the country, the power of the new India dreams, the power of the Ninth India.
It's well known to me.
Some of them live in society.
If they don't speak quietly, they don't sleep, if they don't seek ways to roam instead of meeting, they don't sleep.
In such a situation, if the common people talk about the events happening in their lives with new hopes, new enthusiasm, it is not the government's importance.
A small kid event of a small colony of peacock can also inspire the people of the country .
With the help of technology, through video bridges, all the moments spent time with the people who were obliged with government planning are so inspiring to me.
Enjoying.
By enjoying work, there is also an excitement to do more work.
New joy, new excitement, new inspiration to indicate life for a man who doesn't want to.
I'm blaming the people of the country today.
40,50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and worked to give me new power.
Another time I'm telling you I'm paying for everyone.
My favorite patriot, we'll suppose we're gonna be doing something good there somewhere if we're supposed to live around us.
There are people who do good.
We can enjoy that aroma of goodness.
A couple of days ago came to me.
It's a great match.
There's a piece of engines, professionals.
Our farmer's brother-in-law, who works in the fields of another bed, is surrounded by farming.
You're gonna think that these two different colors are Kada.
Their relationship is - Carpet Professionals in Bangalore, I.
T engines are united.
We've arranged a natural prosperity trust together.
This Trust has been set up to repeat the benefits of the farmers.
Connecting the farmers, creating plans, trying to repeat the resources of the farmers.
With new symptoms of వ్యవసాయానికి, how to grow new crops, this trend started training farmers through professional, engineer, technology.
Moreover, those farmers who do not produce a single kind of crop in their fields, those farmers who have not been able to get more benefits, they are growing vegetables.
They are also getting good benefits by using their own mobilisation.
The peasants who grow cereals also meet this trust.
Farmers are playing a key role in all the work till the production of the crop.
That's why all the benefits are farmers.
It's an attempt to keep the right of the farmer's partnership, determined.
To increase the crops, it has also been made specially a Seed Bank for the right cognizable seeds.
Women watch these Seed Bank functions.
Women were also involved in this work.
I'm telling you a lot of expression to all the youngsters who tried this event.
Professionals, technology, engineering, these young people who came from the world crossed their territory and stood with the help of the farmers, rolled with the villages, picked up the path of rice-ridden roads.
For the second time, I would like this country's life to be their experimental experiments, to know, to know, to the people, to know, not to know, to make some people good for their constant efforts, everybody's many expressions to my own.
My favorite patriot, j.
S.
Ti wants to run a square.
The nation's dream is One Nation, One Tax.
It's real.
One nation, one Tax Reform, if anyone has to appreciate it, I'll appreciate the States.
GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism.
All the states have decided to settle for the country's Hitt, so big tax reforms have been implemented in the country.
So far, GST Council Taluko's 27 meetings.
People of different types of states participate in emitting, people with different political obsessions participate in different states of different regions.
But this GST council has already taken all the decisions taken.
There were 17 types of teeth in the country before GST.
But after this arrangement, one of the same tables came into operation in the whole country.
The success of truth is j.
S.
T .
And a kind of celebration for truth.
Before this many times in the country there were complaints on Ajmaish in the matter of teeth .
J.
S.
T .
Low jee.
S.
T .
I'm in place of Azmaishi.
Take the T.
From return to refund the entire online is done only through information technology.
J.
S.
T .
I'm supposed to stop you.
The trunks are fast.
Besides this not only the time but also the role of logistics is very beneficial .
The biggest tax evolution ji in the world.
S.
Tie will be.
The reason for the success of such a big tax reform in India is that people themselves have to do it.
J through public power.
S.
THE'S FUCKING.
Ordinarily, such a big improvement, the slopes of five-seasons will be easy to sustain such a large population in such a big country.
But this new tariff system has facilitated its position only in a single sector, in the success of the realistic excitement of the country, the enthusiasm of the honest people.
Besides, he'll also make changes through his inbuilt system.
It's so big victory.
This victory has been achieved by 125 crores.
My dear patriot, once again finishing the Manki Bath program, meeting you, waiting for the Manki Bath program to come to another chance to talk to you.
Several cleanings for all of you.
Thank you a lot.
