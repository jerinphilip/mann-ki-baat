Mind, October 2017 My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Chhath, celebrated six days after Deepawali, is one of the most rules in our country celebrated with loyalty
In which traditional rules are followed in every matter from food to costumes
The unparalleled mountain of Chhath-Puja is completely connected with nature and with the worship of nature .
Sun and water are at the center of worship of Mahaparva Chhath , then bamboo and soil made utensils and mandals are integral material related to their worship method .
The worship of the rising sun in this great festival of faith and the worship of the sun drowning is full of unique rituals .
The world is engaged in worshiping the growing people, but Chhath-Puja also gives us the ritual of worshiping them, whose drowning is often certain
The significance of sanitation in our life is also expressed in this festival .
Cleanliness of the entire house before Chhath, along with river, pond, pond, puja place i.e. cleanliness of the ghats, all people join the whole zeal
Sun Vandana or Chhath-Puja - is the festival of environmental protection , disease prevention and discipline .
Normally people understand the inferiority of taking something forgiveness but in Chhath-Puja after the half of the morning there is a special tradition of eating after asking for prasad .
Behind this tradition of asking Prasad , it is also recognised that ego is destroyed .
A feeling that hinders the path of progress of a person
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India .
My dear countrymen, "Mann's talk has also been appreciated, criticism has also been happening"
But whenever I look at the influence of the matter of the mind , my belief becomes firm that with the masses of this country the talk of ' mind ' has been tied to hundreds of unbreakable relations ' .
Take the example of Khadi and Chandloom
On Gandhi-Jayanti, I always advocate for handloom, and what is the result
You will also be happy to know this .
I am told that on 17th October this month , about one crore twenty lakh rupees have been sold at Khadi Village Industries Building Store in Delhi .
Khadi and handloom, having such a big sale at the same store, you must have enjoyed hearing this too, satisfaction
During Diwali , the sale of Khadi gift coupan has increased by nearly 680 percent .
The total sales of Khadi and Chandicrat have also seen 90 percent increase this year from last year.
It seems that today young, elderly, women, people of every age group are preferring Khadi and Chandloom
I can imagine how many weavers families, poor families, families working on handlooms, how much profit
First Khadi, Khadi for nation and we talked of Khadi for Washion, but for some time I can tell the experience that Khadi for nation and Khadi for ashion now, Khadi is taking place for transformation
Khadi is emerging as a powerful means to empower him by bringing changes in the life of a poor man from a poor man.
It ' s playing a very big role for the village .
Mr . Rajan Bhatt has written on the NarendramodiApp that he wants to know about my Diwali experience with the security forces and he also wants to know how our security forces celebrate Diwali .
Shriman Tejas Gaikwad has also written on NarendramodiApp - Can our house also be arranged to reach sweet safety forces
We also remember our brave security forces
We also feel that the sweetness of our house should reach the soldiers of the country .
Deepawali will be celebrated with great joy for all of you .
Diwali came to me this time with a special experience .
I once again got the privilege of celebrating Deepawali with our security forces stationed on the border .
This time celebrating Diwali with security forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir was unforgettable for me .
For the struggle, dedication and sacrifice of our security forces facing the difficult and odd conditions on the border, I respect every soldier of our security forces from all the countrymen
Where we get the opportunity, when we get the opportunity - we should know the experiences of our soldiers, listen to their glory
Many of us will not know that our security forces are playing an important role in establishing peace not only on our border but also across the world
By becoming the UN Peacekeeper, they're illuminating the name of India in the world
Now on October 24 last year, UN Day, United Nations Day was celebrated worldwide
ENE attempts to establish peace in the world, everyone remembers its positive role
And we ' re going to believe ' Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam ' i . e . the whole world is our family .
And because of this belief , India has been actively participating in various important initiatives of the UN since the beginning
You must know that the introduction of the Constitution of India and the introduction of the UN Harter, both we start with these words
India has always emphasized women's equality and the UN Exclusion of Human Rights is a living proof .
The propose that was done in its initial phase was all men are born free and eual, which was decided by India's representative Hansa Mehta's efforts and later accepted all humans beings are born, free and fuel
It seems to be a very small change , but there is a vision of a simple thinking .
India ' s role in the UN Peacekeeping operations is one of the most important contributions that India has contributed under UN Embrella .
In the United Nations peace-defense mission, India has always played a big active role
There are many of you who may be getting this information for the first time
More than 18 thousand Indian security forces have served in UNPeacekeeping operations .
At present , nearly seven thousand Indian soldiers are connected with UNPeacepepping initiatives and are 3rd Highest number all over the world .
By August 2017, Indian troops have served in about 50 operations, out of 71 Peacekeeping operations worldwide
These operations, Korea, Ambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Webanon, Sudan, have gone to many countries in the terrains of the world
In Congo and South Sudan , more than 20 thousand patients have been treated in the Hospital of the Indian Army and the number of people have been saved .
India's security forces have not only protected the people there in different countries but have also won their heart by doing people's friendly operations
Indian women have played a leading role in peace .
Very few people will know that India was the first country to send a common police unit in the United Nations peace-creation mission in Liberia .
And see, this step of India became an inspiration for countries around the world
And after this, all countries started sending their own women police units
You will be proud to hear that India's role is not limited to peacekeeping operation, but India is also working to train efficient feacemakers of nearly 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha our brave peace protectors have reached the message of peace and harmony worldwide .
Peacekeeping operations are not easy tasks
Our security forces have to work in remote areas .
It has to stay between different people .
Different conditions and different cultures have to be understood .
They have to mould themselves according to the local needs and environment there
Today, when our brave UNPeacemakers remember, who can forget Capt Gurbachan Singh Salaria who fought for peace in Lango, Africa
Remember them, every countryman's chest flows proudly
They were the only UN Peacekeeper, were heroic men, who were awarded the Param Vir Chakra
Lieutenant General Premchand ji those I
Endia is one of the Peacekeeper who created a specific identity in Cyprus
In 1989, at the age of 72, he was made force commander for operation in Namibia and he provided his services to ensure the freedom of that country
General Thimayya, who was also the head of the Indian Army, laid the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and invited his all for peace work
India has always been sending messages of peace, unity and goodwill in the world as a peacekeeper
We believe that everyone lives with peace, goodwill and proceeds towards the construction of a better and peaceful tomorrow
My dear countrymen, our virtuous land has been adorned with great people who have served humanity with selflessness
Sister Nivedita, whom we call Bhagini Nivedita, was also one of those extraordinary people
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Noble in Ireland but Swami Vivekananda named him ' Nivedita ' .
And Nivedita means that which is fully dedicated
Afterwards , he proved himself to be his name .
Tomorrow was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita .
He was so impressed with Swami Vivekananda that he abandoned his happy life and dedicated his life to the service of poor
Sister Nivedita was very hurt by the atrocities in the British kingdom .
The British had not only embraced our country but also tried to make us mentally embraced
To create inferiority in us by showing our culture down, this work continued continuously
Bhagini Nivedita re - established the pride of Indian culture .
National-conscious awakening people worked together
He went to different countries of the world and raised voice against the propaganda of Sanatan Dharma and Darshan .
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subrahmany Bharati has been famous for his revolutionary poetry Pudumai Penn (Pudhumai Penn ) , New Women and Women empowerment .
It is said that the inspiration was Bhagini Nivedita .
Bhagini Nivedita also co - operated with the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu .
He helped in publication and publicity of Basu ' s Research through his articles and conferences .
This is a special beauty of India that spirituality and science in our culture are complementary to each other .
Sister Nivedita and Scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu are the strong examples of this .
In 1899, a terrible plague happened in Calcutta and hundreds of people lost their lives .
Sister Nivedita started the work of cleaning the drains and roads without worrying about her health
She was a woman who could live a comfortable life but was engaged in the service of the poor .
On receiving inspiration from this renunciation , people distributed their hand in service .
He taught the importance of cleanliness and service to the people through his work .
And their tomb is written on the Fere Reposess Sister Nivedita who gave her all to I
India - Sister Nivedita is resting here who gave her all self to India .
Indeed , they did it .
For that great personality there can be no more suitable tribute than today that every Indian should take education from his life and try to walk on that service path itself .

Such diseases were very rare among young people .
But our liestyle has changed

If someone sends photos of young children's efforts then there is a story of youth team Jeorts .
Somewhere there is a story of innovation about sanitation , or there is a news of changes about an officer ' s passion .

There a whole NG team called Cological Protection Organization launched a campaign for cleaning in Chandrapur Fort .
In this campaign lasted for two to seven days people did the work of cleaning the fort with a time-work without halt
Two-and-a-half days
beore and after - these photos they sent me
Looking at photo, I was stunned and whoever sees this photo, whoever feels frustrated by seeing the dirt around him, sometimes he feels how cleanliness will be fulfilled - then I will tell such people the youth of cological protection organization, their sweats, their courage, their resolve, you can see in those winning pictures

We all know that the foundation of modern eclipse India, they kept it
We can learn a lot today from the extraordinary journey of the great child of Mother India .
On October 31 , Mrs . Indira Gandhi also left the world .
The specialty of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was that he used not only to give changes, but he was capable of finding a practical solution to the complex problem to show it.
To realize the idea, he was great in it
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took over the reins of India in a formula .
