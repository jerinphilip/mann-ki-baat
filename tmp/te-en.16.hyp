Man Ki Bath: My favorite countrymen, greetings
The Chhat festival coming six days after Deepavali is one of the most regular festivals of our country .
On that day, all kinds of traditional rules like food practices, habitations, etc.
This festival was celebrated with the nature of this chant worship of every festival , with the pleasure of nature .
Sunny, water is worshiped during this worship.
Different materials tied with these rituals, soil plates, moon etc.
In this festival filled with belief, the message of sunrise, sunrise, is full of a special synthesis.
If you worship the people of the world, praying to those who know that it is unforgettable to settle in the moon's worship, it also tells us to worship the chest.
This festival is also said to be so important in our life to celebrate the rituals.
People also clean the shores of Pattu, river, pond and worshipping rivers by boiling the whole house in front of this festival very excitedly .
This sun namaskaras or chest puja environmental protection, disease prevention, regular festival.
Ordinarily, people consider it to be squeezing by asking.
But it is a special tradition to ask for the prasad after the completion of the shortcoming in this chanting puja .
The tradition of asking for such a prasad is the purpose of destruction of the ego.
The egoistic feeling blocks man's growth.
It is natural to consider everybody proud of this great tradition of India.
My favorite countrymen, people who are listening to the word, are demonstrators.
But when I look at the effect of the word in Mansu, the word of the people of the country will be a hundred percent strong bond.
Khadi, take the example of the tricks.
During Gandhi Jayanti, you will also be so happy that I know what happened to the result of the fate of the folks.
On the fifteenth day of October i.e. Dhan Church, at the record level in the Khadi shop of Delhi, the house of rural industries, about one crore and twenty lakh rupees have been approved.
Khadi, kidnapper, two girls should be such a big height that you also have a funny thing.
During Deepavali approximately 680 percent increase in the sales of Khadi Gift Coopers was approved.
Khadi, even in all the sales of handicrafts, this year approximately ninety percent increase has been approved.
Young people, elders, children, aged, women, all adults are also preferred to eat, eat.
So I would guess how many of the families working in the country, how many poor families are benefiting.
Earlier Khadi was called Khadi for the nation.
I said Khadi for fashion.
Now, Khadi for Naation, Khadi for Fashion took all the transformation for Khadi.
In addition to bringing changes in the life of devoted workers , both the powerful means of bringing them up with respiratory power are also changing .
In rural industries they play a very big role .
Rajan Bhat said that he wanted to know about my Deepavali comrades celebrated with security forces in the Narendra Modi app.
Besides, our security forces also knew how to celebrate Deepavali.
Tejas Gaikwad, how to provide our home sweets to the security forces in the n Narender Modi app
At the time of the festival, we also remembered our heroes.
I thought it would be better if our home sweets were provided to the security forces.
I think you're celebrating the festival of Deepavali with joy.
This time Deepavali also gave me special feelings.
On the other side, we got the opportunity to celebrate Deepavali with our heroic security forces.
This time I am unconscious to celebrate Deepavali with the security forces of the Greater sector of Jammu and Kashmir .
How hard, tough and tough in the borders of the country, our security forces are protecting the country, that confrontation, dedication, sacrifice, I respect every soldier of our security forces all over the country.
When we get the chance, when we get the requirement, we have to know the experience of our soldiers.
Listen to their glorious stories.
The combination of the soldiers of our security forces, not only in the border, but also the main role of establishing peace all over the world, is not known to many in us.
The UN Peacekeeper is renouncing the name of India worldwide as peace observers in the United Nations.
A few days ago, on October 24, UN Day, that was the ICC Day celebrations all over the world.
Efforts to unite kingdom to establish peace in the world, everybody remembers their successful role.
We believe in the principle of a family of old people.
That's our family all over the world.
With this belief, India's first United States Committee, Taluko, has been deciding active participation in various main efforts.
You know, the revolt of the affair of India, the departure of the ICC Charter, both begin with the words of 'we the People'.
India has always supported women's equality.
Human Rights of UN Declaration is its direct example .
The words 'All men are born free and ual' in the first volume of this are changed by the efforts of India's everybody Hanssa Mehta.
Then they are accepted as 'all human beings are born, free and eual'.
It looks like a very small change but it shows a strong idea.
India has played the most important role in the United Nations Peace Protection Act, part of Umbrella.
India has always been playing a major activity role in the Palestinian Security Mission of the ICE.
More than 18 thousand Indian security forces have already known this information for many people who have provided their services in the UN Peacekeeping operations.
Today seventy-five Indian soldiers are tied up with UN Peacekeeping initiatives.
This is the third largest number of Yavat world .
By August 2017, Indian troops provided our troops in about 50 operations in the 71 Peace Protection Act conducted by the ICC worldwide.
These operations, Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan, etc. have been in many countries in the world.
Congo, in South Sudan, the Indian Army has provided treatment to more than twenty-five patients at the hospital.
And so many saved.
India's security forces have won many hearts not only saved the people there in many countries, where the people have fought friendly operations.
Indian women have played a key role in peace establishment programmes .
A lot of people know that the Imperial Empire in Liberia has been sent to the Women's Police unit under their Peace Movement.
These steps put in India have been inspired by the inspiration of all the narrow countries of the world .
Then, all the other countries have started sending their own women's police units.
India's role is not limited to peace protective activity.
You'll be grieved to hear about India's training in about eighty five countries of Peacekepers.
Mahatma Gandhi, our Veer Shanti protectors, who went from this land on Gotham Buddha, gave the messages of peace and harmony to the world.
Peace security operations aren't so easy.
Our security forces also have to work in dangerous areas.
It's gonna have to be between mankind.
Several situations, different traditions have to be traced.
They have to interfere with the local needs of those places, according to the circumstances.
That's why our heroes remind of the peace guardians of the IC empire, so the captain of Gurbachan Singh Salaria.
Can he forgive his survival by fighting for peace in Kango of Africa
Every Indian's heart smells with a grave as soon as it touches them.
The only Ikya empire dedicated to the title of the Supreme Cycle, the Peace Protector, the Veer Purusha.
Another Indian peace guard Lieutenant General Love Chand, who brought special significance in Cyprus.
In 1989, at the age of 72, he became the Forse Commander for Namibia Operations, provided his services to ensure that country's independence.
General Thimana, who is headed by the Indian Army, also took the leadership of the ICP peace patronage team in Cyprus.
He offered his surveillance to establish peace.
Peacefully, India has always been giving the message of world peace, unity, goodwill.
I believe everybody lives with peaceful prospects, walks ahead of the direction of a shining peaceful future.
My favorite patriot, our pilgrimage land is full of the greatness of human service.
Sister called our sister's representative is also one of the unusual people.

The British tried to make us psychologically dragons other than the slavery of our country.
They're constantly trying to create harmlessness in ourselves, showing less our culture.
The brother reproduced the honor of Indian culture.
National Spirit has been awakened to unite people.
Going to different countries of the world, he rebuffed against the bad propaganda about Sanatan Dharma, Truthology.
Renowned nationalist, Tamil poet Bamman Bharati has celebrated his revolutionary poem 'Pudhumii Pon ', Navatara woman and women's authority.
It's called the inspiration of the brother.
The brother-in-law also supported Jagdish Chandra Bose, a great scientist.
Bose's research was helped in the propaganda and propaganda by his warriors and meetings.
Our Indian special beauty is in itself to provide one another completeness in our culture spirituality and science science .
Christ represented, scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose's direct example.
In 1899, the terrible plague disease spread in Kolkata.
Millions of people died as soon as they saw.
The brother-in-law started working to clean the roads without ignoring his health.
The luxurious life is also busy in the service of poor people.
People who have been inspired by swimming began to assist in the service programs.
The pocket explained the clarity and services to the people with their actions.

It's very surprising to hear the children also having diabetes.
It's also used to infect such diseases.
That is, in the past, such diseases came only to those who live for rich and luxurious lives.
Such diseases were rare in young people.
But now our lifestyle has changed.
Such diseases are known by the name of lifestyle.
In our food habits changes , lack of physical work in life is the main cause of such diseases happening in the following age .
Social, family needs to take care of this matter.
Think of this shit.
No more precautions.
The small tasks have to be regulated in the right manner, to change their habits, to change them naturally.
Families should try to make their children happy to play in the fields.
If possible, the elders should also try to go to the playground with the children.
Don't use the children, do the habit of walking down on the stairs.
After dinner, everyone in the family, try to walk with the kids.
Coung India for Coga... especially our young friends are useful in pursuing a healthy lifestyle, protecting them from lifestyle.
See how beneficial the yoga of twelve minutes before the school starts.
Yog can be done in the house.

It is surprising because yoga can do somewhere.
No special equipment, no fields needed.
Many researches have been done to know how much yoga is used to control diabetes .

The results that have been found are very provocative nowadays.
All Ayurvedas, yogani, we don't see only through sickness.

Every day the champion has to be finished in mind.
If you send a photo of small children's attempts, there are stories of young team attempts at another place.
If there's some creative discovery about cleanliness, there's news about the changes that came from some powerful gathering.
A few days ago, I've got a wide report.
In which the fort of Chandrapur in Maharashtra is the story of Taluku .
A NGO team called Ecological Protection Organisation conducted a cleaning program in Chandrapur fort.
In this two-and-a-half-day program, people have run a cleaning program standing in a team, without being tired.
Two hundred days per row.
Before the program, they sent me the photographs after that.
I was sure to see the photo.
Look at those photographs, the Ecological Protection Organisation Youthani, their sweat, their courage, all their concepts, in those biography photographs.
As soon as you see them, your despair turns honourably.
This Bhagirath attempt for cleanliness is a unique example of beauty, equality, often.
The forts are our traditional symbols.
The responsibility of preserving historical buildings, keeping clean is all over the country.
I'm telling you the Ecological Protection Organisation, the whole of their woodens, the people of Chandrapur.

Women's survival, women's honor has given importance.
Guru Nanak had traveled twenty eight thousand kilometres on foot.
Under this journey, they gave a message about real humanity.
They spoke to people.
They've seen the path of truth, sacrifice, karma.
Communications about equality in society.
Not only by words but by the message of his actions.
People put lungs as they grow in service.
The feeling of unity , equality among the people is awakened by the acceptance of lungs sitting together .
Guru Nanak gave three messages to empower life.
Living the name of the Supreme, working hard, helping the needy.
Guru Nanak also wrote a gurubani to tell his words.
In the year 2019, we celebrate the 550th light of Guru Nanak.
Come on, we're trying to move forward in their messages.
My favorite patriot, two days later, we are celebrating the victory of Balbhai Patel on October 31.
We all know that the modern universe is the service of India.
How much can we learn from the unusual journey of the great child provided by the mother of India.
On October 31, Mrs. Indira Gandhi left this disappearance.
The specialty of Sardar Balbhai Patel is that they have the ability to find out the vital solutions to show them not only the transformations but also to them.
He's the only one he's in shaping the thought.
Sardar Valbhai Patel has dedicated the fugitives standing on the unity of India.
Cross Indians have decided to try to bring India under an authority.
Their determination gave them the power to face all the obstacles.
Where the morale is needed, he works with hypnotism.
It's done there where power is needed.
