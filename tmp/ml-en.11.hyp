Man Ki Bath, March 2018, greet my dear countrymen.
Today is the day of Ramnavami.
In this prayer day of Ramnavami, all of my good wishes.
We have seen all the moments of his life as Ramanama's strength was in the lives of a composite father.
On January 26, all the experts in Asian countries were here.
They've brought it to the cultural groups of the nations.
It's so proud that most of the nations were present in front of us.
That is, Rama and Ramayana are not only in India but also in this territory of the world, but also in Asian countries.
I'll once again give you the good luck of Ramnavami.
My dear people, like every time, your letters, e-mails, phone calls have been found in great quantities.
Komal Takur My Geovi.
I read about the online course of culture in India.
I felt very happy to see you having a cultured ID professional.
In this direction, he told the concerned department to get the information about the ongoing efforts.
I also pray to Man Keebat's sermons who works with culture to take the instructions of Comalji.
Mr. Ghanshyam Kumarji is from Bahakar village of Nalanda district of Bihar.
I read the comments you wrote in the Nandermodi app.
It's very important that you're worried about the underground water level.
Mr. Shakal Scientist, writes "Ayushman will be Ayushman Bharat" with a beautiful gift from Karnataka, and "Ayushman will be the Earth, if there is any thought about every living creature on this earth."
And in the summer, the birds request everyone to keep water.
Shakal ji, I've reached all the sources of your emotion.
Mr. Yogesh Bhadresh ji says I want to tell the youth about their health.
He thinks our youths are physically weak when Azian is staring up with countries.
Yogesh ji, I think I'm going to talk to everybody about health this time.
I guess I'm talking about Fit India.
I think you're going to start the Fit India Region with all the young people.
Last day, the French President went to Kashi Yatra.
Mr. Prashant Kumar has written from Varanasi that all the scenes of that journey, the touching and affecting the mind.
He expressed his desire to inspire all the photos and videos in social media.
Prashantji, the Central Government has already made photographs on social media and Narendramodi Applem.
Like that, review, bring the tricks.
From Chennai, Angha, Jaisesh, and many children have written to me in the gratitude cards given behind the book 'Exam Warrior'.
Angha, Jaiesh...
I'd like to say that when you see these letters, my whole day's tiredness will be without a minute.
And so many letters, so many phone calls, opinions, and many things I read and heard...
I'll have to talk for months even if I talk about them.
This time most of the letters are from children.
They're writing about the exam.
It's written about their plans for the holiday.
It's said about the water for birds in the summer.
There are letters of peasant brothers about Kisan fairs and farming from the country.
Some people have been instructed to know about water conservation.
A habit I've seen before we began to speak through Man Keebat Radio is more about summer in the letters of summer.
Before the exam, the student comes with friends' interests.
There will be letters about our festivals, our culture, our traditions, etc. in the festival season.
I mean, the understanding changes according to the weather, perhaps it is true that things in our mind change the weather of some people's lives.
Why not change
In these things, in these experiences, in these examples, so much inspiration, energy, self-consciousness fills up the urge to do something for the country.
It involves the power to change the entire climate of the country.
I know through the way that Ahmed Ali, a rickshaw in Kreing's Assam, built 9 schools for poor children with his wishes, sees the immense will power of this country directly.
When Dr. Azit Mohan Choudhari of Churpur went to Phudpa and listened to the story of giving free medicines to the poor, there was an opportunity to understand the mutuality of the people of this country.
The car driver of Kolkata, Saidul Luskar's sister, died due to the treatment of time 13 years ago.
He decided to set up a hospital to prevent a poor man from being treated.
Saidul sold home jewellery for his purpose.
Many travellers traveling in his car donated their hearts open.
An engineer gave her a month's hunt.
After 12 years of money collected, finally, the Bhagirath Yatra of Saidul Laskar appeared.
A hospital with 30 beds alone has been built in the village of Rewari near Kolkata due to his hard work and vision.
This is the strength of the newborn.
A woman in Uttar Pradesh, when she built 125 toilets in many battles, she sees maternal power when she inspires women for her rights.
Introduces many inspirations to my country.
Today the vision of India has changed to the world.
Today, when India's name is very proudly celebrated, the sacrifice of these children of Bharatamba is hidden.
Today, in the country of youth, in women, in poverty, in the middle class...
.
We're moving amongst all sections of our country, and our country is moving.
This self-confidence, this positivity, will help us to witness our vision of newbornness, will be dreamers.
My dear patriots are very important for the farmers and the sisters for the coming months.
That's why a lot of letters are connected to agriculture.
This time I saw DD Kissan Channel in a video of discussions with the farmers.
Every farmer should contact the DD Kissan channel of the distant...
I think new uses should be done in their own farming.
Mahatma Gandhi princes are all scientific or Lohiaji, but Choudhari Charnsing is considered to be a gift of agriculture and peasantry and country's economy and public life.
His emotion is in this verse that the farmers and the farmers were interested in the fields of land, fertilizers and growers.
He said, "To forget how to dig the earth and to tand the soil, is to forget ourselves.
"If we forget it to boil and to protect the soil, it's like forgetting itself.
Like this, Lal used to strongly argue about the protection of plants and plants, good agricultural practices, etc.
Dr.
Ramnohar Lohia said that people need to wake up in large quantities to ensure better income, better water conservation facilities, to ensure and produce food items and milk.
In one of his speeches in 1979, Chaudhari Charnsing taught the farmers to use new technology and conduct new discoveries, and reflect their needs.
I went to the farming festival organized in Delhi last day.
I had a very comfortable experience of my discussions with the peasant brothers and scientists, knowledge of many experiences related to agriculture, understanding, knowing new findings related to agriculture.
But I was most impressed by the Meghalaya and the peasants there.
This very slightly surprising state has seen a big deal.
Our farmers in Meghalaya produced records in comparison to five years before 2015-16.
If the target is determined, if the zeal is strong, it's clear that if the mind is visual, it can be performed.
Today farmers have the help of technology, which has the power to produce carsica.
I can see from the letters that have come... .. . . . . . . . . . .
S.
P) It's written.
They say I'm talking explicitly about this.
Brother brothers, this year's budget has taken a big decision to give the farmers the right price for the crop.
Non-fired crops, M.
S.
P.
That's the least one-and-a-half of their expenditure.
When I consider the MSP, in a small amount of money spent, the pay of other workers, their four-handed men, machines or the cost of the rented machine, the price of the wine, the cost of all kinds of wagon used, the cost of water supply, the state estimation, the interest of the work root, the song.
It's not just that the farmer who drives himself into the fields of his family, starts the roots of his family.
Besides, there are very large scale operations in the country for the farmers to get the right price for the crop.
The rural markets are trying to connect with Halsey's market and Agol routine.
The farmers don't have to go too far to sell their crops.
For that, the APMC, which has been upgraded, will be linked to the platform by providing basic facilities to twenty-five thousand rural markets.
I mean, in a way, the country is facilitating connectivity with any routine.
My dear countrymen, this year, the beginning of the hundredth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will be reduced.
It's a historic occasion.
How can the country celebrate this festival
Selfweight is our destiny.
Besides, how will the greatest attention of Gandhiji be given by hundreds of twenty-five people mixing their shoulders
Can you do new events
Can you ignore new methods
You share your opinion with Mr. Geovi and my request.
What should be the Logo of Gandhi 150
Slogan, wizard, or celebration
Get your opinion on this.
We must unite the attention of the bapoon together, remembering the bapoon, and inspire him to the new heights of our country.
The phone...
Good luck.
Honorable maiden...
I'm talking to Praty Chaturvedi Gudga.
As Prime Minister, Swachhbharat Abhiyan made a successful initiative, now healthy India must be successful in the same way.
Tell me how people, governments, institutions are being organized for this movement...
Thank you...
Praty Chaturvedi is right.
I think self-sufficient, healthy and mutual pursuits.
In the health sector today, the country has progressed through traditional methods.
It was the responsibility of the Health Ministry before all the health related matters in the country.
Today, all the departments and ministries...
Though it is a Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Human Affairs, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, the State Governments are working together for healthy India.
With the immunity routes, the cost of health care is paying attention.
Resistance is the lowest and easy healthcare.
The more we are aware of the immunity, the benefits of the person and the family.
If you want life to be healthy, it's your first choice.
We all took the challenge together as a country.
Consequently, within 4 years, the Sanitation coverage doubled, about 80 percent.
Besides, there are widespread operations in the country's health centers.
Yoga has been accepted all over the world as a immune healthcare.
Fitnes, Velnas, the two giants are supplies.
Yoga has changed to a public place today, it's because of our dedication to the house.
This time, the International Yoga Day remains 100 days to reach June 21.
In the last three International Yoga days, people from all over the country participated in enthusiasm.
We have to make sure that all families, friends, all of us will be inspired to do yoga this time.
Inspire young people and adults in new ways of attraction for yoga.
TV, Electronic Media has organized several programs related to yoga throughout the year.
From now on, as a preliminary day of yoga, can you make a fun of yoga
My dear countrymen, I'm not a teacher of yoga.
I'm a singer.
But some people have made me a yoga teacher through their creation.
I've made 3D Animated Video.
I'll share that video with you.
So we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
The healthcare should be supposed to be able to reach.
Ordinary people must get cheaper and faster.
That's why efforts are going on in the big head.
Today, more than fifteen people's population centers have been opened across the country.
There are more than 800 medicines available at cheap prices.
New centers are opening.
Tell the people who want me to accord to Man Keebat's sermons - their cost of medicine will be very low.
They'll be very helpful.
The rate of heart stend for heart patients is up to 85 percent.
The cost of replacement of knees has decreased by 50 to 70 percent.
According to the Ayushman India plan, about 10 crore families i.e. about 50 crore people will be given the cost of Rs 5 lakh per year, central government and insurance company.
In the 479 medical colleges of the country, the number of MBBS seats has been increased to 68,000.
New EIMs are being opened in different states to get better treatment and health facilities for the people of the country.
In every three districts, new medical colleges will be opened.
2025 in the country.
B.
It's planned to be free.
It's a big job.
You need your co-operation to wake up all the people.
We have to work together to get rid of the TV.
My dear countrymen, 14th April.
Baba Saheb is the birth anniversary of Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar told India about industrialization.
As far as he was concerned, the industry was a good medium providing jobs to poor people.
Today, when we are successful in launching Mac in India in the country, Dr.
We are inspired by the dreams of India in the form of Ambedkar Ji Vyavasaik Maha Shakti.
Today, India grows as a remarkable center in the global economy.
Today, the world's largest foreign investment, FDI, is going on in India.
The world is seeing India as a center for new investment and development.
It was thought that industrialization could be done in cities.
That's why Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar believed in the urbanization of India.
Including his vision, the 'Smart Citizen Mission' has begun in the country today.
All kinds of facilities in big cities and small towns of the country, if it is good roads, water supply, health facilities, education or digital productivity, should be provided.
Baba Saheb had a great faith in self-reliance.
He wanted no person to be in poverty.
At the same time, he believed that he could not remove his poverty only because he gave something to the poor.
Initiatives like Modra Yojana, Startup India, Standup India are giving birth to our young comrades.
In 1930-40, Baba Saheb Ambedkar talked about the ports and waterways when he talked about roads and railways in India.
He saw the water power as a national power.
Baba was Saheb.
The development of the country has given importance to the use of water.
Different River Valley authorities, various water commissions, are born in the vision of Babasaheb Akbar.
Today, there are attempts to reduce history for waterways and ports in the country.
There are new ports in different sea shores of India, strengthening basic facilities in the old ports.
In the four decades, most of the discussions and the Second World War, the Cold War and the Division.
At that time, Dr.
The ambassadors based on the thinking of a new team India.
He gave importance to the federalism, the federal system, to work together in the development of the country and the state.
Today we have adopted a wizard of co-operative federalism across all the heads of the government.
The most important thing is Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedaks are inspiration for millions of people like me in the background.
He showed us that it wasn't inevitable to be born in a big or rich family to the top.
But those who live in poor families and dreams in India, they seem to win and try to witness that dreams.
Yes, many of them do.
Baba Saheb also played the game of Ambedkar.
Trying to put him back.
The poor and the poor, don't move in the family, don't be one, try to make sure you don't get anything in your life.
But the picture of the new India is different.
The Ambedkar and the poor are India's background.
Dr.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Ambedkar, Gramswaraj Abhiyan has been organized from 14th to 5th May.
Accordingly, there will be special programmes in regard to rural development, poverty and social justice in India.
I also request you to attend these programs with enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, many festivals are coming in the coming days.
Lord Mahavira's victory, Hanuman Jayanti, East, Vaishakhi.
Lord Mahavira's victory is the time to remember his sacrifice and penance.
Lord Mahavirji's life and vision will inspire him to Ahimsa.
Glory of Mahavir Jayanti for all the people.
Yesukristo's inspirational advice will be remembered when he talks about Easter.
He always gave a message of peace and harmony and justice and mercy to mankind.
In April, Vaishakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India.
In those days only ' Bhihu ' is celebrated in ' Judasheel and Sat Way ' in Assam .
Then go to West Bengal, the harsh and joy of Vaishakh will be filled.
These festivals are somehow related to our farming and agriculture.
Thanks to the nature for the unprecedented gifts we get from these festivals.
Once again, you're lucky in the name of all the festivals coming to you.
Thank you very much.
