Talking about the mind, December 2014, my dear countrymen, today I have the privilege to meet you.
You may think why the Prime Minister does such things.
One, I do because I'm less prime minister, chief servant.
Since childhood I have heard one thing and perhaps it is the inspiration of "Man".
We have heard since childhood that distributing grief reduces and increases by distributing happiness.
"I've ever shared grief, sometimes share happiness too.
What I talk about is some pain in my mind and lightens my mind and sometimes there are some things of happiness that I try to qualify that happiness by dividing between you.
I had said last time that for a long time I am worried about our young generation.
Concern is not happening because you have made me the Prime Minister, the concern is that if a mother's red, son of a family, or daughter get stuck in such a swamp, then that person is not the whole family is destroyed. .
The society, the country, everything gets wasted.
Drugs, intoxication is such a confusing disease, there is such a evil thing that shakes the good people.
When I used to work as Chief Minister in Gujarat, many times I used to come to meet our good officers, ask for a holiday.
So I asked why .
Earlier, he did not speak, but used to talk with love, he used to say that the son was trapped in a bad thing.
To get him out, leaving all this, I have to stay with him.
And I had seen that those whom I believed to be a very brave officer, they also left only crying.
I have seen many such mothers.
When I went to Punjab once, I got mothers there.
He was also angry, expressing very pain.
We have to worry about it as a society.
And I know that the child who is trapped in this evil, sometimes we consider that child guilty.
They consider the child bad.
The reality is that drug addiction is bad.
The child is not bad, addiction is bad.
The child is not bad, we do not consider our child bad.
Believe habit bad, consider addiction bad and find ways to keep away from it.
If you do the child, then he will start getting intoxicated.
It's a Psycho-Socio-Medical problem in itself.
And we have to treat him as Psycho-Socio-Medical Problem.
In the same form, Chandle will have to do and I believe that some problems are beyond medical.
The person will have to work in one direction of self, family, man friend, society, government, law, all together.
Doing these pieces does not have to solve the problem.
I just kept DGP Conference in Assam.
I expressed my pain in front of them with resentment.
I have asked for a serious debate in the police department to find a solution.
I have also told the department why not we start a toll-free helpline.
So that in any corner of the country, the parents who have trouble that their son feels that they are trapped in the drug world, one is also ashamed to say the world, where is there hesitation
I have asked the government to make a helpline.
They will definitely think in that direction very soon and do something.
In the same way, I know the drugs brings three things and I'll tell him, it's Three with evils - I'm not talking about There of entertainment.
H is arkness, the seith is estruction and the third is evastation.
The intoxication takes into the dark street.
It stands at the turn of destruction and there is nothing in drunken except for waste.
That's why I have discussed this very concern.
When I had touched this in the last "Mana" program, more than seven thousand letters from all over the country came to me on the address of AIR.
The letters that came in the government are different.
Online, on government portal, thousands of e-mails came on MyGov.in portal.
Perhaps millions of comments have come on Twitter, Facebook.
In a way, the matter lying in the mind of the society has started coming out together.
I am especially grateful to the media of the country that they carried forward this matter.
Many T.V. have done special one hour programs and I saw that there was no program of government's evils, there was an concern and I believe that in a way the problem was to get out of the problem. And due to that an atmosphere of good discussion has started.
What are the government's responsibilities, they are also sensitive.
They think they can not remain indifferent now.
I sometimes want to ask those drunken youngsters whether you have ever thought you might realize living a different life in addiction for two hours, four hours.
There will be a feeling of liberation from the troubles, but have you ever thought that the money you buy from where the money goes
Have you ever thought
Imagine
If this drug money goes to the terrorists
If terrorists buy arms from these money
And from the same weapons a terrorist would shoot in my country ' s breast .
My country's young man will be martyred
So have you ever thought
The mother who killed the red of a mother, the life of the mother of India, the living and death of the country, has been shot in the chest of the soldier, is it not so
There is money for your addiction somewhere in that bullet, think once and when you think about it, I say with confidence, you also love Bharat Mata, you also respect the soldiers of the country, then how can you help the terrorists, drug-mafia help this business
Some people feel that when there is disappointment in life, failure comes, when there is no way in life, then man falls into addiction.
I feel that there is no goal in whose life there is no goal, there is no high intention, there is a vacuum, it becomes easy to enter the drug.
If you have to avoid drugs, to save your child, make them a goalist, make intentions to do something, make dreamers.
You see, then they will not mind the rest of the things.
He won't, I have to.
You must have seen, who is a player. The mind of gold by taking quilt in the cold, but he does not sleep.
He goes to the open ground, goes to four o'clock in the morning, at five o'clock.
Why
The goal has been fixed.
In such a situation, there will be no goal of communism in any of your children, then such evils become a way to enter.
I remember Swami Vivekanand's words today.
They are very accurate sentences for every young man and I believe that the sentence has repeatedly been said by Swami Vivekanand ji - "Take an idea, make that idea your life."
Think about him, look at his dreams.
Take that idea into life.
Fill your mind, muscles, nerves, every part of the body with that idea and leave all other ideas.
This sentence of Vivekanand ji is for every young mind, it can be a lot of work and so, I will tell the youth that many things can be avoided only by becoming a goalist.
Sometimes living among friends, it seems that it is a big cool.
Some people think that this is style statement and in the same situation, at times, they are trapped in such a serious disease.
It's not style statement and it's cool.
In reality, it is a ruin of waste and therefore, when all of us have the pride of drunken songs, now tell your fun, applause, then dare not to say, dare to reject, not only that, they are also doing this wrong, unfair to say that you dare to say.
I want to say to parents too.
We do not have time tomorrow.
There is a need to run to live life.
There is a need to run to make your life better.
But in the middle of this race, do we have time for our children
Have we ever seen that we mostly discuss their secular progress with our children
How many marks brought, how did Yeam go, most of what food
Isn ' t there any food
Or where do you ever go
Where is not to go, the scope of our things is so limited.
Or have we given opportunity to open our children inside her heart
You must do this.
If the children open with you, then what is going on there will be known.
The bad habit in the child does not come suddenly, slowly starts and as the evil starts, its change in the house starts.
That change should be closely seen.
If you closely look at that change, then I am sure you will save your child in beginning.
Keep in mind his friends and do not limit things around progress only.
The depth of his life, his thinking, his logic, his thoughts, his book, his friend, his mobile phones.What is happening
Where his time has passed, his children have to be saved.
I understand that no one can do what parents can do.
For centuries, our ancestors have said some things very scholarly.
And then they are called Statesman.
It is said here that 5 years of Lau Lijiyids Laun Tadan Dei 5 years Lou Lijiyidas Laun Tadan Desut, in sixteen years, Mitra Saris Gani Deisut means that in the sixteen years, the child should be treated by parents love and Dular for the age of 5 years, after which the son should be 10 years, he should have disciplined, and sometimes we have seen the sensible mother does not talk to the child.
There is a huge punishment for the child.
The punished mother gives herself but the child is also punished.
Mother should say that I will not just speak today.
You see a 10-year-old child gets upset all day long.
He changes his habit and when he becomes 16, he should be treated like a friend.
It should be openly spoken.
This is our ancestors very good.
I want to use it in our family life.
One thing I am looking at those who sell medicines.
Sometimes such a thing comes with medicines as long as such medicines are not given without the doctor's prescription.
Sometimes cough syrup also starts taking drug habits.
The beginning of intoxication becomes.
There are many things I do not want to discuss it.
But we have to accept this disciplin too.
These days, for good education, the children of the village have also left their state and won boarding life for admission in a good place, won in Costel.
I have heard that he sometimes becomes the entrance to this evils.
About this, educational institutions, society, security forces will have to keep great awareness.
An attempt will be made to fulfill the responsibility of which it is responsible.
The government will have to do whatever the government will be responsible.
And our efforts should be made for this.
I also want these letters that have come, there are big interesting, big painful letters and there are also big inspirational letters.
I do not mention everyone today, but a Mr. Dutt was drunk, who was drunk.
He went to jail, he was also very bonded in jail.
Then life changed later.
He also studied in jail and gradually changed his life.
His story is very popular.
Yerwada was in jail, so many stories will be there.
There are many people who have come out of it.
We can come out and should also come.
Our efforts should also be made for him, in the same way.
I will also urge Welebrities in the coming days.
Whether there are cine artists, people associated with the sports world, people associated with public life.
We should keep aware of the cultural saints, wherever people get opportunities on this subject from everywhere.
We should continue to give the message.
It will definitely benefit from it.
I urge those who are active in social media that we all together rugs Free I
Can run a constant movement with ndia hash-tag.
Because most of the children associated with this world are also associated with social media.
If we rugs free I
Andia hash-tag, if we proceed, we can create a good environment of a public education.
I want to move this thing further.
We should try everything, who has achieved success, continue to shake it.
But I have touched this subject so I said that distributing sadness reduces sadness.
There is a pain of the country, I am not giving any preaching nor do I have the right to preach.
I am only distributing my sorrow, either in the families in which it is sad, I want to be part of that misery.
And I want to repeat the atmosphere of a responsible.
Maybe there may be differences in this subject.
But you have to start from anywhere.
I had said that I want to share happiness too.
I got an opportunity to meet the Blind Cricket Team last week.
World Cup won.
But what I saw his enthusiasm, saw his self-confidence, God has given everything that has given eyes, hands and feet, but perhaps we have no such sentiment, which I had seen in those blank cricketers.
What was the excitement, what was the enthusiasm
That is, I also got energy together with them.
Indeed, such things give life a great pleasure.
In the past, a news was discussed.
The cricket team of Jammu and Kashmir defeated the Mumbai team by going to Mumbai.
I am not seeing it as a defeat.
I'm looking at this incident in another form.
For the last long time, all the fields were filled with water due to floods in Kashmir.
Kashmir is passing through the crisis, we know that even among the difficulties this team, with the help of Team-Spirit, the victory that has achieved is unprecedented and the difficulties are the opposite circumstances, how can the goal be achieved even after the crisis, it has been shown by the youth of Jammu and Kashmir, and therefore, I am particularly pleased to hear this, glory and I congratulate all these players
Two days ago, United Nations has approved Yoga, the whole world as Yoga Day on June 21.
There is a very pride for India, an opportunity of joy.
Our ancestors had developed this great tradition for centuries, it added to the world today.
Yoga used to benefit in personal life, but Yoga also showed that could be the reason for connecting the world.
The whole world got involved in the UN on the issue of yoga.
And I am seeing that the proposal was passed unanimously two days ago.
177 countries, undread and Seventy Seven Countries became of-Sponsor.
In the past, it was decided to celebrate Nelson Mandela ji's birthday.
Then Fundred and Sight Live Countries of Sponsor was made.
Before ID
Efforts were made for International Toilet Day, then Fundred and Twenty Two Countries of Sponsor.
Before that on October 2, Undread and Forty Countries of Sponsor were made for Non-Diolence Day.
With this kind of proposal, undread and Seventy Seven Countries have become a Co-Sponsor i.e. a World Record.
I am grateful to all the countries of the world who respected this spirit of India.
And decided to celebrate World Yoga Day.
It is our responsibility that the right spirit of yoga reaches the people.
Last week I got an opportunity to meet Chief Ministers.
Chief Ministers have been meeting for 50 years, it has been happening for 60 years.
But this time it was to meet the Prime Minister's residence and more than that we started a Retreat program, in which there is no paper in hand, no pen, there is no officer, no file.
All Chief Minister and Prime Minister sat as a friend of equality.
For two and a half hours, talked very seriously about the different subjects of the country, talked in a light atmosphere.
Open the mind and talk.
Somewhere he did not give him the shadow of politics.
This was a very pleasant feeling for me.
I also want to share him among you.
Last week I got an opportunity to go to Northeast.
I stayed there for three days.
I specially urge the youth of the country that if you wish to see the Taj Mahal, if you wish to see Singapore, you ever wish to see Dubai.
I say friends, have to see nature, to see God's natural form, then you must go to Northeast.
I used to go before.
But when he went as Prime Minister, he tried to recognize the power there.
Our Northeast filled with the prospects of immense powers.
There are so many lovely people, this is the best environment.
I have really come with great pleasure.
Sometimes people ask
Does Modi not tired you
I say that going to Northeast, it seems that there must have been tired anywhere, that too went away.
I enjoyed so much.
And the people who gave love, the reception of me is one thing.
But the person who had adopted was really going to touch the mind, touching the heart.
I will also tell you, this is not the right to enjoy Modi only to every country of India.
You must enjoy it.
It will be the next "mind" then it will come to 2015.
This is probably my last program of 2014.
My best wishes to all of you are Christmas.
In the new year of 2015, I give you a lot of good wishes in Advance.
It is also a matter of great pleasure for me that the matter of my mind is in regional language at 8 o'clock in the morning in your regional channel, in which my mind is spoken.
And I have seen some in the regional language, some people like me also remove the voice.
I am also surprised that I congratulate the artists who are associated with our AIR.
And I see a very good way to reach these people.
Such a large quantity of letters have come.
Seeing these letters, our Akashwani has found a way out of it.
People are comfortable, so they have taken post-box numbers.
If you want to say something on "mind" then you can write on post-box now.
Walkpost Box 111, Akashwani Delhi will wait for me for your letters.
You do not know, your letters become inspiration for me.
One or half of your pen can come from the country.
I am grateful to you.
Then we will meet some Sunday in January 2015 at 11 o'clock.
Thank you very much.
