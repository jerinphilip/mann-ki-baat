The voice of the mind, June 2018.
My folks
Today, once again, in the voice program of the mind, I've got to meet you all.
A few days ago there was a historic playback in Bangalore.
You all understand that I'm describing the taste competition between India and Afghanistan.
It is a matter of great importance to every Indian that the first international test destination of Afghanistan has happened with India.
Two dresses were played very special in this cattle.
Rasheed Khan, the slave watchman of Afghanistan, is already in this year.
B.
El.
The Market used to be specially organized, the President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Kani, was also supposed to have made me a tag in the dudder, "Afghanistan people enjoy a lot about their Hero Rashit Khan."
I'm demonstrating our Indian friends for our sportsmen to set up a boundary to extract their capabilities.
Rashit is the representative of the special documents of Afghanistan.
He wrote with joy that he didn't leave him anybody else in the world.
This cat will be one of the unforgettable ones.
It's only the first step, it's worth remembering, but for another reason, I think it's special.
The Indian dress showed the whole world to take it.
The successful dress showed what they could do.
If we were wearing successes, we had smoked two dresses together with the Australian dress in the first phase of the Test.
We can understand from this disappearance about the quality of the sportsmen.
The game is to connect the world, shows the best way to expel the capabilities, capabilities of our youth.
My life is for both India-Afghanistans.
I'm sure there's a game with one of them like this in the neighborhood that we'll play and grow.
My folks
On the 21st of the month of June last , when we celebrate the fourth international yogic day , the white world was also connected to it .
In the world, people have enjoyed yoga with full enthusiasm and interest.
In the Brussels, the European government, the United Nations Assembly in New York, and the war of Japan's turkey, we could see Yoga in all the places.
It is said that the historical event of yoga art was held in South Africa for the first time , in which women used to perform large numbers of asanas .
In the highest peaks of Ladakh the soldiers of India and China participated together .
Yoga enjoys the process of connecting all limitations.
Thousands of excited people affiliated with many countries royal, time, industrial, colour, breed of all kinds, have been able to share it with a lot of excitement.
When the people of the world participated in 'Yogic Day' programs with their enthusiasm, India had played a lot of poetry in this excitement.
Our country's military warriors, lands, sky, seas, seeing the sympathizer of yoga in three places, rose to 125 million people of our country.
Some warriors used to perform yoga in the ships of water.
Like this some warriors used to practice yoga on the snowy mountain peaks of Siachen .
Our warriors of the Air Force, in the middle, imagined 15,000 feet above the ground and hung everyone in a humor.
It's a matter of fact that they didn't do it as they sat on the plane, they did it in the air.
Yoga training was started at all places in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings, sports fields.
A vision of Ahmadabad touched the heart.
There, only 750 changed competitive brothers grouped in the middle of the world, together gathering yoga practices.
Without any control of royal, time, geography, the world's work to connect everyone.
We have lived for many centuries with the feeling of the world and the world.
Our Rishi-Munis, the Holy Mothers have emerged, showed it to be yogic.
I'm supposed to understand the revolutionary work today is healthcare.
I'm supposed to run this hygiene, and be ahead.
And people will make it a part of their life.
My favorite folks
MyGav and Norendra Mody Corps are asking me to talk about the doctors who have spent the first day of July in the church of the mind, the right thing.
We remember the doctors only when there are confrontations.
But on this day, we celebrate medical services, dedication, achievements, and my thanks to them.
Those who pray to our parents, because mother herself is alive all ourselves
That's how doctors rebuild us many times.
Doctors don't stop working with the destruction of disease.
Sometimes doctors smell as friends of the family, guide us to our lifestyle, and treat us with the help of disease.
Today doctors have medical ability, even though our normal lifestyles are concerned, they are deeply experienced about the impact of our health.
Our native doctors have written your nutrition all over the world because of their skills.
In the same way, our doctors are also known for complicated medical problems as well as skilled and hard worker in medical profession.
Through the voice of the mind, all our medical friends from the country's population, the doctors who come to the day of July will demonstrate the life of the day.
My little folks
We were born in India's land, we were very fond of.
A country of India's comprehensive history, not a day or month without historical events.
There is a tradition everywhere in India.
Anyone associated with those places is a sacred, sweet, sweethearted, sweethearted, all of them have a history of their own participant.
"The parents are they
Fucking
I'm Dr.
I'm talking to Surendra Mishra.
I know you're coming to Makhar on the 28th day of June.
I'm staying in a small village Datwa near Makhar, it's in Gorakpur.
A place situated in the shrine of Makhar Kabirdasar , kabirdhasar is remembered for social welfare , mixed with the ideas of Kabirdhasar .
Your activity has a serious impact on all the levels of society.
Please tell the people about Kabir Tasar through the actions of the Government of India .
Thank you for your phone call.
The truth is that I'm coming to Makhar on the 28th day.
You think you're very nice about the name of Capeeerwat in Gujarat
I had arranged for a large national level for the companions of the kabirvad of Gujarat, the sacred kabirthasarth tradition.
You know why Kabirdasar went to Makhar.
At that time there was a belief that the people of the age of Makhar would not go to heaven, but if they were in the Kashi, they would be heaven.
Makhar was considered sacred.
But the sacred Kabirthasar didn't believe it.
He did the work of evil foolishness and misconceptions in his time, so he went to Maqhar, where he reached the shrine.
The sacred kabirdhasar pressed on social compassion, peace, brotherhood etc. through his poems, poems.
It was his regulation.
In his compositions, we get to see this, in today's world it's the same prediction.
Listen to his doha, Kabir Soye Beer Hay, Joe Jane Ber, Joe Par Beer, Na Janehi, Soka Birman Peer.
I mean, to understand the sufferings of others, romantic pilgrimage
Who don't understand the tragic of others, they're thick.
Kabirthasar gave special pressure on social welfare.
He was shy for the time he lived.
During that time, the struggle was full, then he gave a message of peace and harmony, concentrating people's minds and enforcing the differences.
What he describes in another doha...
.
Jahan's Day Day Dharma Hye, Jahan Lof Thehm Bob.
Jahan Groth Tahm Paul Hai, Jahan Ghashma Tahm Op.
That's where there is a club, there's aroma.
Wherever there is loyalty and blackness, there's hope.
Wherever there is humidity, there is a leg or death.
Wherever there is sympathy, God smells there.
He and Jati, our Phuchso Satu Kyi, the Bhooch Legie knowledge.
Don't listen to what their slaves are in saints, get knowledge in them.
It's just that people should accept, enjoy their knowledge, enjoy what they want to leave in public.
His ideas have passed many centuries, and have been affected even today.
Today, when we see his thoughts, he seems to be telling about the world of knowledge today.
Now when we're talking about Kabir Tasar, his second trick stands in my mind.
In this he says - Guru Govind Dou Kate, the danger of Kake Lakun.
Ballihari Guru Abne, Govind Dio Pathay.
It speaks of the grace of the guru, which is a guru in the world, the guru Nanak Dev, who showed the path to the people of Kotanukodi, has been enlightening him for centuries.
Guru Nanak Dev had told them to neglect the evils of the royalty of the society, to absorb the human society of one another.
Guru Nanak Dev will say that the service of the people who need is the throne of God.
Wherever he goes, the throats made for social benefit.
The social discipline created a tired humor.
Here all the slaves, all the species, all the time and the people of the streets can come and eat food.
Guru Nanak Dev has only discovered the combination of Linger.
In the year 2019 Guru Nanak Dev was celebrated on the 550th birth anniversary .
I'd like to share it with the enthusiasm and interest of all of us.
How can we celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev throughout the society, in the world, what new ideas, what new suggestions, what new imaginations, enjoy products, with great enthusiasm, we all celebrate this graceful day of their birth, that I will enjoy you all.
My little folks
India's freedom fighter is very long, extensive, very deep, many sacrifices filled.
There is a history associated with the state of Punjab .
In the year 2019, the Jalianwala Bagh layer has been 100 years old, which is a horrific incident of human society.
The 13th day of April, 1919...
Who can forget that dark day
It's the duration day for all the controls, duties, dads, immortals, and all the people.
It's a hundred years long since this incident happened.
You can imagine how we remember it.
But we have to remember the message that couldn't be destroyed by the time of this treachery.
Coordination and bitterness cannot end up with any problem.
Success can only be calm and imagination, and sacrifice alone.
My heart-breaking folks, the Rohini part of Delhi, Raman Kumar Vehicle, in the Narendra Modi Act, Dr. on the 6th day of July.
During this event, Dr.., with the name of Shyama Prasad Mugharji's birthday.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee has been asking that the people should tell them about them.
Raman, they're the first, I'm supposed to thank you for myself.
I'm glad to see your interest in India's right.
Next time, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mugharji was the day of his time, that is the 23rd month of June.
Dr.
Even if Shyam Prasad Mukherjee is associated with many departments, he has the most neighbouring departments that are education, administration and departmental affairs.
Many knew that he was the assistant of the very age of Kolkata University.
If he was a helper, his age is only 33.
In 1937, Dr.
It is also known that Shyama Prasad Mugharji had spoken in Bengal in the Portuguese Fair of the Colcutta University at the residence of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
This is the first time that in the Portuguese celebrations of Kolkata University in the British reign this is the first time in Bengal .
Dr. From 1974 to 1990.
Shyama Prasad Mugharji was the first industrial department of India.
It's not excellent if he lay down the prescription of the industrial development of India.
In the first industrialist principle of independence in 1948, his concepts, telescopes, etc. were exposed.
Dr.
Mr. Mukherjee's dream, India should be made of professional self-sacrifice in every sector, to change his own self-determination.
In the same way, he wanted to pay full attention to the medium and small businesses, handicrafts, inflation and businesses.
In order to provide financial and institutional library for the full memorial of small and cottage industries, from 1948 to 1990, he established innumerable handicrafts, weekends, corridors and rural businesses.
Dr.
Mugharji gave special attention to making the production of the security forces of India sweethearted .
The construction of these four major schemes like Chitrajan Railway Agency , Hindustani Airlines Factories , Cinderi Corps , Damodar Valley Institute etc . are also Dr .
Shyama Prasad Mugharji is the partition of her.
He was devoted to the development of West Bengal .
As a result of his illusion, intelligence, creative activities, a large part of Bengal was saved, part of India.
It's Dr... the synonym of India.
Shyama Prasad Mugharji was the most important of them.
At least 52 years of age, he had to harass his life.
Come on
We're Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mugharji, remembering his message of sympathy and brotherhood, will take full confidence in bringing India to the path of progress.
My folks
In the last few weeks I got the chance to talk to the beneficiaries of various health departments by Konoli .
Going to the father of anger, he's got a chance to know directly about the changes in life.
People shared your conviction, your glad tempers, all about your slavery.
I didn't see it as a government program for me.
I've seen it experienced a kind of learning.
Through this, people enjoy me looking at the faces...
.
Tell me what can be in the life of a happy moment than this
If you're aware of a common man...
He gave his simple words, his experience language, the possibility of him, the vision of the mind.
Women affiliated with far away villages have been providing services of large citizens living in villages through public awareness center to the first passport .
In Chhattisgarh, a sister has been selling the ice cream and collecting a sheeta palm.
Like the Anjan Progress of Jharkhand , lakhs of youth of the country , people come to the villages living in the world and get expensive medicines .
At the same time, a young man was looking for work two-three years ago, but now he has been working successfully, making a job for 10-15 people.
The schools of Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa regions have been serving on important matters such as reservoirs in the dingering lab at their youngest school.
How many stories were like this
We're in our country, as much as we don't have a success story.
In this whole event, more than the government's success, things about simple people's success, the power of the country, the power of the dreams of new India, the power of the new India - I've realized that I've heard them.
On the other hand, there are so many people in the society who don't talk about discomfort, in a genius about complicity, uncomfortable, uncomfortable, unfortunately quiet.
When you talk about the events that took place in your life with simple humans, new neglects, new excitement, in this world, I don't believe in the success that it has come to the government.
The story of a small girl comprising a remote village turns to 125 million folks.
With the help of technology, through video bridge, spending with the followers...
.
Promise to be very comfortable, more emotional, and to work more.
The joy of birth, a new excitement, and a new pregnancy whenever you can live very deeply.
I'm supposed to thank the folks.
40-50, lakhs of people joined this video bridge program, you've served me with a new energy work.
I want to repeat my thanks to all of you once again.
My folks
If we saw us around, somewhere, some good thing must be seen in our eyes.
There are people who know good.
We can face the aroma of good.
A thing has attracted my attention in the past.
It's a very sensitive combination.
If there are industrialists and technicians on one side then on the other hand there are agricultural brothers and sisters related to agriculture .
You'll be surprised that both of these are different areas.
You can assume what can be between them.
But in Bangalore, experts in the carperade, investigators of information worker and engineers made a single corner called Sahaj Samrutha.
This mirror was done with the aim of the farmers' income to be rotten.
The peasants have joined themselves, set up plans, made successful efforts to enhance the income of the farmers.
As well as learning the new products of agriculture, how to do the natural cultivation, with a thousand other crops in the fields, scientists and technologists have trained the farmers.
In the past, the peasants used to produce only one thousand in their fields.
The result was not particular, it wasn't even right.
Today, they don't mean vegetables, they're selling good prices by making their vegetables marketed through this diamond.
Farmers who produce cereals, love to join you in this.
On the other hand, till the first marketing of the production, the farmers are the first to participate in a complete weaponry field.
On the other hand, the share of farmers in the future, they are also trying to ensure their rights.
Massoole should be good, so there must be good sweat seeds.
For this, the profitable seed bank has been formed.
These seeds are enhancement of bank related work.
Women are also connected in this.
I'm demonstrating my amazing appreciation for these youngsters to do this kind of effort.
I'm sorry in another way, industrialists, engineers, technicians, these youngsters associated with the world, leaving their circles, connecting with the farmers, connecting themselves with the villages, mixing together with the fields and the fruits.
Buddies
Your young man is really predicting any young man.
The other youths of the country will certainly go to their neighbourhood, take care of their works, and they will also have the idea of how they can act in different areas of society in their respective areas.
Continuously many guys are doing something good, they all live with me.
My folks
Skirk and service tax, J.
S.
T.
It's over a year.
A dream, a country that belongs to all the folks is the only tax.
If anybody wants to appreciate the same sequence of embracing, I want the States to admire those appreciations within itself.
J.
S.
T.
That's the best specimen of the collaborators, in which all the states have joined together to folklore.
Afterwards, it was the biggest taxpayer of the country.
So far 27 GST groups have been held, many types of political ideals sit in it, migrate different states, divide states with different predecessors.
But they're all right, j.
S.
T.
I can say that all the conclusions made so far have happened in the name of the community of everyone.
J.
S.
T.
Before it was done, there were 17 different types of sequences in the country, but now this method is changed by only one tax.
Success, coincidence of the GST coins.
In the past, in the case of taxes, the instrument of the instructor raj is the state of Tandalkar.
J.
S.
T.
The insector's place is taking information business.
Until the money is regained, all the consistent information goes through the technology.
J.
S.
T.
As soon as the test papers arrive, the skin's traffic takes place quickly, so that the time is familiar, the skin's service department also has a lot of benefits.
J.
S.
T.
Maybe the world's largest sequence.
In India, the reason for such a big tax evasion was gained by the people was accepted by the people only through power.
S.
T.
It's just confirmed the victory of x.
Generally, this big improvement, such a big country, when it makes such a big family, it can take 5 to 7 years to complete accordance.
But as a result of the enthusiasm of the coins in the country, the immense imagination of the coins, the participation of the people's power, the largest number of new gatherings has been establishing their place within a year.
Only through the existing structure, it can make necessary changes.
In this case, the biggest success is that 125 crore folks have also won this success.
I love folks
Once again, when I finish the hole of the mind, wait for the next mind, talk to you, contact your mind...
.
You have wonderful lives.
Thank you very much.
