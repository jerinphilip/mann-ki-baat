The voice of the mind - 26.
3.
17 folks, my love for all of you.
In every corner of the country many families are in line with the products for their children's selection.
Whoever's finished the exams, they're really happier.
Wherever the selections are going on, the families of those children are experiencing pressure.
But in the voice program of the past, I repeat the things that are related to the students, those ideas will be beneficial for you in the election season.
Today is the 26th of March.
This day is the freedom of the country.
Historical struggle against pride...
..
.
Under the leadership of the partition, the people of the community achieved great success.
Today, this important day, I'm demonstrating the freedom of life for all the brothers of the country.
I'd like to see the traditional and progress, I'd like to believe that the strong friend of the Indian community, as a good friend, we'd continue our participation in peace, security and development in the skin and skin.
Rabindranath Dakor, his memories are our pride to be the prosperity of all the Namels.
The nationalist Rabindranath Dakor of the country has produced him.
A very comfortable thing about Gurudev Dakorip...
.
In 1913, the first person of the Asian treasury, Rabindranath Dakor.
The British gave him the knight.
In 1919 Jalianwala Bagh was built on the bed .
At that time, Rabindranath Dakor had made a person among the magnificents who gave a humor against this bedbuck.
This bed palm has had a deep impact on the mind of a boy full of twelve years .
In the heart of the small snake who came out of the fields and fields , this is the sixth radius .
In the year 1919, the brethren of India who was full of twelve years of age, all the disappearance of patriotism, Diagayi Bhagdh Singh.
Three days before this , on the 23rd of March , Lord Singh and his companions , Sukhdev , Rajguru servings were not lifted by the British .
On the 23rd day of March, when this unhappy incident took place, there was no sign of death on the faces of Tyagyach giants such as Bhagdh Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru servoirs who slaughtered India's mother.
They sacrificed all the dreams of life to the freedom of the Mother of India.
This blind man is still convinced of all of us.
Bhadsingh, Sukdev, we can't squander the ear of the princely service.
The British empire was also found in this ear.
They were imprisoned, sentenced to sleep, but the British were scratching concerns about how they were running.
On the 24th day of March, it was decided that he was sentenced to death, but on 23rd March he was abducted.
Anybody's designed a shit like this unknowing.
Then their bodies were taken to the Punjab state today, somebody's color was burnt.
Many years ago, when there was the chance to go there for the first time, I could feel a kind of jealousy in that soil.
Whenever you get the chance, then go to Punjab, Bhadsingh, Sukhdev, Rajkuru, Mother of Bhagt Singh, come to the place where the cemeteries of Badgeshwar religion are located, I want the youth of the country.
Freedom hunt, it's a period of extension of its acceleration.
On one side, warriors like Bhadsingh, Sukhdev, Rajguru were exciting the youth to take the weapon revolution.
Only 100 years ago, in the month of April, 1917 Gandhiji had performed Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha.
The exhibition of Gandhiji's thoughts, the methods of Gandhiji, etc. was first published in the Chamber of India.
It's a thrill in the freedom struggle tour, especially from the ways of the struggle.
Champaran Satyagirham, Kheda Satyagirham, Ahmadabat, Mill workers stopped working, which was the beginning of the deep impact of Gandhiji's thoughts and methods.
In 1915 Gandhiji came back from foreign countries and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new exhibition to the country.
Today, we cannot imagine the Champaran Satyagraha with the blackness of Gandhijis in our mind.
Imagine, one who returned to India in the year 1915, only two years of experience...
..
.
The country didn't know him, he didn't have any effect, it was a beginning.
We can't even imagine how much trouble he felt, how much he had to work.
Through the Champaran satyagraha, he showed a miraculous significance of Gandhiji's competitiveness, the power of understanding the pulse of the Indian community, the power to pursue the Englishmen who were very poor and obscure.
Today we're aware of the importance of Gandhians
But think about Gandhijis, just 100 years ago, the general life of Gandhijis started through Champaran Satyagraha, which he had a learning experience.
We can learn from him how to start public life, how to work, how to live, how Gandhians worked.
During that time all the great leaders like Rajendra Baba, Acharya Krubalani used to go to Gandhiji village.
He learned how to connect with freedom struggles to the people, connecting them with people.
The British didn't know anything about this method of Gandhiji.
Conflicts and creations were held, both were held at the same time.
Like the two sides of a coin, the struggle on one side in the way of Gandhians, on the other side.
Prisoning on one side, creative actions on the other side.
The biggest equation could be seen in the activity of Gandhians.
What is Satyagirah
What if it's complicated
What if you don't have to cooperate with this big empire
Their description is not by the words of Gandhians, but by his successive action.
If we celebrate the centenary of the Champaran satyagraha today, we must understand how magnificent the power of the magicians of India is.
Even today, we have to deal with this quantity of power in the freedom struggle
All need to be aware, to be healthy, to the mindset of 125 crores of people, to work, to populate for the country, to make society, to make a participant for the freedom of the country, is an important testimony to those who devote their integration.
Today we are traveling in the 21st century, who doesn't want to change India in today's times, which Indians want to participate in the change of the country
These hunts of 125 crore folks, their efforts to change, are going to be a variety of steps to confront yourself with a new India.
The new India is not a plan for the government.
The new India is 125 crore people's rooms.
This is the feeling that 125 crore people should build a new India.
It's a desire, a mood, a thirst, in the deepest of the minds of 125 million people.
If you try to understand what's going on around us, we'll be surprised if we get away from our personal life, see the activities of the community with priest.
Several lakhs of people, apart from encouraging their treasures, socially, for the simple simple people who are suffering from it, make something unconstitutional.
Peacefully, they're getting engaged in these works like devils.
Many go to hospital everyday, help the patients.
There's a lot of blood donations going to Odotych just after asking me the news.
Somebody buys a batini, they have a lot of fun of food.
Our country is a country with many such valuable matrimonials.
People call the service of the Macasson, it's all in our nervous system.
If we look at it simultaneously, it's very glorious that it's so important.
When we talk about new India, it's a natural thing to raise the principles about this idea, it's acceptable in public opinion.
If 125 crores of folks are sworn, if they decide their way, they start fighting one after the other, the dream of 125 crores of folks, we're going to grow up, we're gonna be good.
It's not necessary that all matters should be covered in the Revenue Plan, the government's plan is to be spent on the government's money.
I'm sure I'm gonna go through the traffic laws, I'm sure I'm not going to use petrol-tessels every drunk in the week, you'll be able to see the biggest change in the country.
The thing may be very small.
That's what I'd like to say that every dweller in the country should be supposed to act as responsible as a dweller.
It's gonna be a magnificent beginning of a new India.
In 2022, we've been killed in 75 years of independence.
Lord singh, Rajguru, we remember the Sukdev supporter, the Champaran satyagraha.
Why shouldn't we take this journey with a systematic and psychological constraints
I'll invite you to share this trip.
My folks, I want you to define my thanks today.
For the past few months, our country has participated in the functioning of digital funds in large numbers.
Interest has also increased in knowing how to enjoy rocky surroundings.
Parama harvests are also busy trying to understand this, gradually advanced towards the direction of how to do business in a rough way.
After the removal of coins many developments can be seen in the design of digital population .
In the two-three months of Bhima Correction, so far only one-and-a-half million people have made it supplied.
We have to fight against my favorite folks, black money, flaws, etc.
Can 125 million people confirm that this year 2.2 million crores of digital routes
If you want 125 crore folks to activate this, there is no need to wait for a decade, which can be done even in the month.
In this way we can deliver school treasures in digital ways, we can take the travel ticket to the railways and the airplane in a digital way, buy medicines in the digital way, if we run cheap food stores, we can take directions for digital wealth.
We can hand these on our daily activities.
You can't even imagine that you're the biggest service to the country through this.
You're acting as slaves in the struggle against black money, slaughter etc.
In the past, many programs have been arranged for digitization for public awareness.
It was decided to do 100 programs across the country.
80-85 events have been completed.
In these the prize plans were also available .
Only 12.2 lakh subsidiaries benefited from this.
7,000 traders win their gifts.
Everyone doesn't make sure to move this work further.
The 14th day of April, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambetter's birthday.
It is already decided that the date of the day of April 14 will be fulfilled by Baba Saheb Ambatkar on his birthday.
A big event has to be arranged for the end of 100 days.
And a big pool is also arranged.
Baba Saheb Ambetguard's birthday is so long that I believe we'll be aware of the beam activity.
We have to be partialized in reducing the use of a lot.
Negative folks, every time I'm gonna give you a lot of suggestions to ask for your advice for the voice program.
But in your suggestions you can always see that you are giving more pressure on cleanliness .
It gives me great pleasure.
A student studying 11th class of Gayatri, administered by Tehran, has given a message through the phone - the prime minister, the prime minister, the minister, you have my jobs.
My mortal lives to succeed you with great promises.
I'd like to tell you my mind's hole.
I'm afraid people should understand how sanitation is important.
I'm supposed to smoke a lot of buffaloes in the river passing through everyday.
This river crosses the Rispana bridge, flows in my house.
We went to the part of our area against the destruction of the river, tried to make people aware of walking.
But it didn't have any use.
I'm asking you if you send a team from your level, you'll be aware of this matter through the reporters.
Thank you.
Brothers, see how much pain is in the mind of a student studying 11th class.
Look how angry he gets to see the cavalry grown in that river
I see it just a good symptom.
I'd like to get angry if you'd feel hungry in the minds of 125 million people.
Once there is anger , if there is a stroke then there is swelling .
Even then, we'll begin to act in architecture against the masses.
It's a good thing to show his anger, too.
He's bringing me advice too
He's also convinced that even if he tried against pollution, they didn't succeed.
Awareness has also occurred since the practice of cleanliness began.
Everyone has brought you together in it.
It's just flourished by a people's movement.
There has been an increase in anger against depression.
Awareness, creative participant, drive, is certainly important.
But sacred, running is not dependent, nature depends.
This drive is transforming the nature.
This drive is the drive that makes cleanliness natural.
Translation can be done in the social system.
Even though the work is hard, it must be done.
I have the greatest feeling that the new leadership of the country, the boys, the students, the young people, is shouting a good symptom.
Today, in the hoove of my mind, whoever is listening to the blackness of the cowardice, they all want me to say the same thing - the news that hurt us all.
The folk of Pasamigu, since the beginning of the voice program, there are colors that have been suggestions about swallowing me food.
We know we're gonna have more food than we need when we're eating in public events.
We're all putting the food on our cloth, but we can't eat it completely.
Even half of our stomach cannot be filled up in our stuff.
You're leaving the sweet food just like that.
Do we ever think of how much we're going to get rid of the remainders we're doing
If we don't keep the fish alive, do you think it's helpful for so many drunken people
It doesn't matter to be realized.
Don't you know what we'll say when we feed the mother's children in our homes
Daddy, you're gonna have enough to eat, that's the only amount of clothing.
It's really something that's been tried in a way.
And yet, in this matter, a great immoral action against the community.
It's an inordinate working against evil.
If you don't finish the food on the other side, the family will be financially benefited.
It's a good thing when it's socially thinking, even when it's a family purpose, it's a useful thing.
I'd like to be more aware of this thing.
I knew some youths who came to run a mobile activity.
Wherever food is sweet, they have been informed, they're going to square the sweet food, they're supposed to be supplied to the needy.
This method that uses food properly, our youths are doing the hard work done for this.
You can meet such people in every state of India .
We don't want to finish the food that their lives are the one that gives us a sense of enthusiasm.
Whatever we can, we just have to put that amount on the floor.
Look at these ways to show changes.
They always say that those who are aware of health , reduce the nutrition in the leaves and the abdomen also reduce the deficiency .
The 7th day of April is the world's health day.
In the year 2030, the Universal Health Coverage has determined the level of healthcare for all.
This way the United Nations Conference is pressurizing the world healthy day ahead of the 7th month of April .
This year their blackmails are stressed.
A study says that more than 35 crore people worldwide are suffering from depression .
Many times we can't understand that there is tension in our surroundings.
Sometimes it's another complication to talk about it openly.
He doesn't know who's been starving in tension, because he's too foolish to tell it out.
I'm convinced by the people that don't consider the unblemishable condition.
We can create a beginning through a psychological environment.
Instead of pressing stress, it's the first thing to show.
Friends, brethren, brethren and sex, open your mind with teachers, talk to your inside.
In some cases there is a lot of distress in children who are specially standing in the hostels .
We must say that we grew up in the colonial family that our nations have made niece.
The family will be big, the complicated environment, and there will be less chances of stress.
Instead of sitting together with your family, mother or other members, instead of eating, I'm eating again, keep my food on the table.
Or when everyone in the house goes out, no, no, I don't want to come out today, and I want to be alone, I'm gonna pay attention to them.
Are you sure why they walk like that
You must understand that they're in the first step of stress.
Take the efforts to improve the situation if they drive away from the privacy, not the privacy of all.
Feel them with those who open their hearts with them.
Having a complicated environment, encourage them to participate in it.
Get them out of the madness of smelling.
This is the best way.
Tension, mental and physical disorders are helpful.
The way diabetes gives smooth lend to all kinds of diseases , the same way the stress of ourselves , the power to love ourselves , fight against the terrible environment , the capability of ourselves, the ability to end, the power of ourselves.
Your friends, your family, your surroundings, your environment, can save you from stress, so you can snatch you out, even if you are stressed.
And there's a way.
If you don't speak explicitly in your dependents, people work with the feeling of service at some place nearby.
Please take care of the service, share their glad temperaments, you can see yourself sliding yourself.
If you tries to understand others' sadness, it's supposed to do that work with service, you'll have a self-confidence.
By mixing with others, through self-sufficient service to others, you can eradicate the burden of your mind easily.
Like this, yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful to get rid of pressure, rest, flexible faces etc.
On the 21st day of June, International Yoga Day.
It's the third yoga day.
You start taking your efforts from now on.
Hundreds of people make sure they share socially in yoga.
If there are any suggestions in your mind regarding the 3rd International Yoga Day, you must send your suggestions to me through mobile work, Guide.
You can create compositions and creations related to yoga, so that people will be more aware.
I'm supposed to talk about a thing today in the mother-in-law.
We're talking about many things about health today.
In the past, the government has made a big decision.
The number of women working in our country is increasing day by day, their participation is increasing, it's a matter of commemoration.
But along with this there are some special treasures for women.
He's supposed to be responsible for the family, and he has a share in the financial responsibility of the house.
Because of this irregularity is done to the new born child .
The Government of India has made the biggest decision.
During the working period, he was released 12 weeks ago.
Now it's been a 26-year-old reception.
Two or three countries in the world have given you more details than us.
For our sisters only the Government of India has taken such an important end.
The basic plan of this program is to ensure that the mother's full love should be available to the child on the birthday of the future of India.
Only then will the health of the mother be excellent.
The reason for this is that only 18 lakh women who have joined regular areas have benefitted it .
My popular folks, on the 5th day of the month of April, the holy Ramanavami, on the 9th of April, Mahavir Jayanti, on the 14th of April, Baba Saheb Amberkar is coming to his birthday.
The lives of these great men will come to us as well as enjoy ourselves, and make us restrain ourselves to cook new India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla Pratipata, Verssh Pradipada, Buddha Years are coming.
I'm supposed to demonstrate my passionate lives to all of you before this guy.
After the monsoon, the fruits begin to rotate, if it's the benefit of the farming.
In many parts of our country this puppet is celebrated in many ways .
Buddhist year is also celebrated in Maharasthra by the name of the dwelling in the Maharastra , also by the name of Sindi Sedi Sand , in the Kashmir , by the name of Navrah , Samvatsar Puja in Avadh region , Jud-shital -LRB- -RRB- in Bihar , Sadwai -LRB- -RRB- in Magadh .
India is a nation with all these differences.
You all live for my last Buddhist year.
Thank you very much.
.
