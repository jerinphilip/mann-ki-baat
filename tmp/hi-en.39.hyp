Talking about the mind, November 2015, dear countrymen, Namaste
During the holy festival of Deepawali, you will have celebrated holidays very well.
There will also be an opportunity to go somewhere.
And trade employment with new excitement has also begun.
Christmas preparations on the other side will also start.
Festival in social life has its own importance.
Sometimes the festival works to fill the wound, and sometimes the festival gives new energy.
But sometimes when there is a crisis in this time of celebration, it becomes more painful, and it seems painful.
There is constant news of natural disaster from every corner of the world.
And never heard and never thought, such natural disasters continue to be reported.
Now we are feeling how fast the impact of climate change is growing.
In our own country, the way in which the high rainfall and that too untimely rainfall and long rain, the losses in Tamil Nadu, especially the states have also been affected.
Many people were killed.
I express my condolences to all those families in the hour of crisis.
State governments join with full power in relief and rescue operations.
The central government also always works with shoulder.
Now a team of Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I believe that the power of Tamil Nadu will continue to move forward at a very fast pace.
And he will continue to play his role in pursuing the country.
But when they look at the crisis around, we need to make a lot of changes in it.
15 years ago, natural disaster used to be part of an agricultural department, because then more natural disasters i.e. the famine was limited to this.
Today its form has changed.
Every level has become very compulsory to work for our apacity building.
Governments, civil society, citizens, every small institution will have to work for very scientific apacity building.
After Nepal's earthquake, I spoke to Pakistan Prime Minister Shriman Nawaz Sharif.
And I had suggested to them that we should join SAAR countries and make a joint eercise for Disaster Preparedness.
I am glad that the seminar workshop of a table work effercies and best practices of SAAR countries was concluded in Delhi.
A good start has happened.
I received the phone of Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
"I am speaking with Lakhwinder Singh, Punjab District Jalandhar."
We cultivate organics here and guide a lot of people about farming.
I have a question that people who set fire to these fields, how to guide them to straw or wheat shrubs, how much they are spoiling on the micro-bacteria that the earth is to the mother and which pollution is happening in Delhi How to get relief from this in Haryana, Punjab
Lakhwinder Singh ji was very happy to hear your message.
One is Anand that you are a farmer who cultivate organic farming.
And they themselves cultivate organic farming, not only this, you consider the problem of farmers well.
And your concern is right but it happens only in Punjab, Haryana.
This is the habit of the people throughout India and traditionally we go on the way to burn the remains of our crop in this way.
One was not the first guess of loss.
That's why we do all that was habit.
Secondly, there is no training in what measures are there.
And due to this it went on, it grew and today it was added to the climate change crisis.
And when the impact of this crisis started coming towards the cities, a lot of voices started to be heard.
But the pain you have expressed is correct.
First of all, the solution is that we will have to train our farmer brothers and sisters, they will have to explain the truth that the burning of the remains of the crop can save time, hard work will be saved.
The field will be ready for the next crop.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are also very precious.
They themselves have that biological manure.
We ruin him.
Not only this, if it is small pieces, then it becomes a draw-right for animals.
Secondly, due to burning, the upper layer of the ground burns.
For my peasant siblings, think that our bones are strong, our hearts are strong, kidney is good, but what will happen if the skin above the body is burnt
Will we survive
Even if the heart is soap, the lives will not be able to survive.
Like our skin burns, it becomes difficult to live.
By the same way, burning the remains of these crops does not burn only torch, these earth mother's skin burns.
The layer above our land burns, which pushes our fertile land towards death.
And therefore, his positive efforts should be made.
This thumb once again pressed the ground, even then it becomes fertilizer.
Or if a pit is stacked in a pit and put some water in the water, then it comes as a best type of organic manure.
The food of the animal comes only, and our land survives, not only that, the fertilizer prepared in that land should be put in it, then it gives advantage.
I got an opportunity to talk to farmers who cultivate banana once.
And they told me a great experience.
At first, when they used to cultivate bananas and when banana crops were over, they had to spend 5 thousand, 10 thousand, 15 thousand rupees per hectare to clean the bananas.
And till the people who raise it, they did not come with a tractor-vactor, they stood like this.
But some farmers proved 66, 8-8 pieces of that thumb and buried it in the ground.
So the experience came that there is so much water in the thumb of this banana that where he is buried, there is a tree, there is no plant, there is no crop, then there is no need to get out for three months.
The water that is in the thumb keeps the crop alive.
And today their thumbs have become valuable too.
They have started earning from their thumb.
The first thing that had to be spent on cleaning the thumb, today the demand for the thumb has increased.
How much small experiment can also benefit, our farmer brother is not less than any scientist.
Dear countrymen upcoming 3nd December I
International Day of Persons with Disabilities will remember the whole world.
Last time I discussed the Urgan Conflict in "Mann".
I also discussed the Helpline of NEET for the Urgan Confliction and I was told that after that matter of mind, the phone calls increased almost 7 times.
And website grew two and a half times.
ID on 27th November
Andian rgan was celebrated as Confirmation Day.
Many well-known people of the society participated.
Along with film actress Raveena Tandon, many well-known people associated with it.
Ergan Configuration can save valuable lives.
"Angana comes in a way with immortality."
When the organ goes from one body to another, that organ gets a new life but that life gets new life.
What can be the best donation and what can be.
A national registry of organ transplantation has been launched on 27th November, patients waiting for Transplant.
A national competition was kept by Emygov.in to design the NEET's logo, endor card and slogan, and it was wonderful for me that so many people took such a part, so innovative way and with great condolence.
I believe that widespread awareness will also increase on this area and in the true sense, the needy will get the best help, because this help can not be received from anywhere until no donation is done.
Like I told earlier, December 3 is celebrated as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally handicapped, they are also rich in an unprecedented courage and strength.
Sometimes the pain occurs when sometimes they ridicule.
Sometimes the sense of compassion and mercy is expressed.
But if we change our vision, change the view of looking towards them, then these people can inspire us to live.
Some can inspire to pass through.
If we get a little trouble then we sit down to cry.
Then I remember that my crisis is very small, how does it live
How did this win
How does it work
And so these are all sources of inspiration for us.
His determination power, his way of fighting with his life and his challenge to change the crisis in power is worthy.
Javed Ahmed, I want to tell him today.
It is 4042 years old.
In 1996, Javed Ahmed was shot by terrorists.
They became victims of terrorists, but survived.
But, due to the bullets of terrorists, Kidney lost.
I
Entestine and lost a part of the intestine.
Serious nature's spinal injury.
The ability to stand on his feet went forever, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
Terrorism's injury also could not hurt them.
His own tongue, but the biggest thing is that without a reason a innocent person has suffered such a big trouble, young people have been in danger, but no resentment, no anger, Javed Ahmed also turned this crisis into condolence.
He offered his life to social service.
The body does not accompany but for 20 years they have been immersed in children's education.
How did the intrastructure improve physically handicapped people
How to develop arrangements for disabled in public places, government offices
They are working on it.
He also shield his studies in the same direction.
He took Master Egree in social work and as a conscious citizen as a social worker, he is making a cylinder revolution today as a messiah of disabled people.
Is Javed's life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember Javed Ahmed's life, his penance and his dedication to December 3.
In the absence of time, I am talking about Javed but in every corner of India, the lamp of such inspiration is burning.
New light of living, showing the way.
On December 3, remembering everyone like this, there is an opportunity to get inspiration from them.
Our country is so huge.
There are many things in which we are dependent on governments.
Be a middle class, a person of the lower middle class, poor, dalit, suffering, exploited, disadvantaged, he has a constant relationship with government arrangements with the government.
And as a citizen, there is sometimes a bad experience from some government Babu in life.
And that perfect experience changes our view of seeing us towards government system throughout life.
There is also truth in it, but sometimes millions of people sitting in this government do good work with service, dedication, which never look at us.
Never knows us, because it is so comfortable that we do not know that any government system, no government is doing this work.
In our country, ASA workers are networked across the country.
We have never heard about the ASA workers in the midst of people of India, nor have you heard.
But when I have become an example of his success in the world as the world famous family of Bilgates Foundation Entrepreneur.
We gave both such billgates and milindagets to Joint Padma Vibhushan last time.
They do a lot of social work in India.
They are spending their time of retirement and whatever they have earned for the poor.
Whenever they come, they meet and praise those who have got the opportunity to work with the ASA workers, they praise them so much, and they have so much to say what is the dedication to the hope-worker How hard do they work
How excitement is to learn new.
They tell all these things.
In the past, the Orissa Government held special honors on the Independence Day of an ASA worker.
A small village of Balasore district of Orissa is Tendgaon, an optimist and the entire population of Shidule-tribe.
There are people of scheduled castes, poor.
And there is an area affected by malaria.
And a hopeful worker of this village, Jamuna Mani Singh, decided that now I will not let anyone die from Malaria in this leopard.
If the news of a small fever comes to the house, then reach.
Based on the primary arrangements which have been taught to be treated for treatment.
Emphasis on every house using pesticide mosquito.
As your own child sleeps properly and the career should be done, ASA Order Jamuna Mani Singh continues to work with full dedication for the entire village to avoid mosquitoes.
And he competed with malaria, prepared to combat the whole village.
How many "Jamuna Mani" will be.
How many million people will be in our side.
We will look at them a little respectfully.
How many such people become the strength of our country.
How do the happiness and misery of society become big companions
I honor all such ASA workers through "Jamuna Mani".
My dear young friends, I have activated on the Internet, especially for the young generation.
MyGov has put 3-book on that.
One C-book is about the motivational incidents of clean India, regarding the ideal village of MPs and in relation to health sector, in relation to health.
I urge you to see it.
Not only this, look at others, read it and maybe you can mind adding such things.
So you must send MyGov.in.
Such things happen that we do not get into our attention very soon, but society has the right strength.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
You also share good events.
Share these C-books.
Talk about the -books and if an enthusiastic young man goes to the schools of EC-Book, tell the children of the Eighth, Ninth, Class , that the brother did so here.
So you can become a social teacher in true sense.
I invite you to join you in nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is worried about climate change.
There is also concern about climaate change, global warming, dugger-digger and it is getting approval as a standard before doing all the work now.
Earth's temperature should not increase anymore.
It is also concern for everyone.
And one of the first ways to avoid temperature is energy saving Energy Conservation is December 14 National Energy Conservation Day.
Many schemes are being run by the government.
The plan of the bulb is going on.
I once said that on the night of Purnima, the street lights should be closed and dark and bathed in full moonlight throughout the hour.
The light of that moon should experience.
A friend sent me a link and I got an opportunity to see him, then I realized that I would tell you this too.
By the way, its credit goes to Lee News.
Because he was Link Wee News.
Noorjahaha in Kanpur does not think of a woman T. No one has got the privilege to read more.
But one thing that is doing is probably not thought by anyone.
He is working to give light to poor people using solar energy.
He is fighting from darkness and illuminating his name.
He has formed a committee of women and has planted a flank of solar energy and he gives a lantern from a rent of 100 rupees a month.
People take the lantern in the evening, they come in the morning and then give it to Charging and in a large quantity, I have heard that people come to 500 houses carry the lantern.
About 3-4 rupees per day is spent but there is light throughout the house and this Noorjaha works throughout the day to recharge these lanterns with solar energy in that plot.
Now see what big people of the world will do for climate change, but a noorjaha may inspire everyone, it is doing such a thing.
And anyway, Noorjaha means to illuminate the world.
The light is spreading through this work.
I congratulate Noorjahan and I congratulate the Wee T because he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur in front of the country and the world.
A lot of congratulations.
Mr. Abhishek Kumar Pandey of Uttar Pradesh has a fond "G Namaskar I am speaking Abhishek Kumar Pandey as an interpreneur from Gorakhpur today, I would like to give Prime Minister a lot of congratulations that he started a program, we would like to know from the Prime Minister, whoever is running this MRA Bank, how are we being supported like Entrepreneurs
Cooperating
Thank you Abhishek ji
From Gorakhpur you sent me a message.
Prime Minister MRA plan unfunded.
Those who do not get the money get the money.
And the purpose is, if I explain in simple language, then 3 is encouraging three , interprises, burning, mpoverment. currency interprises, creates money earning opportunities and money empowers in true sense.
This MRA scheme is underway to help small entrepreneurs.
By the way, the speed I want to go is yet to come.
But the beginning has been good, in such a short time, about 66 lakh people got 42 thousand crore rupees from the Prime Minister MRA scheme.
Dhobi, barber, seller of newspaper, seller of milk.
People doing small businesses and I am happy that there are 24 lakh women in these 66 lakhs.
And most of these helpers are SC, ST, B, who work hard and try to run the family with respect to their feet.
Abhishek himself has told about his enthusiasm.
I also have enough news.
Someone told me now that there is no Shailesh Bhosale in Mumbai.
Under the MRA scheme, he got a loan of Rs 8.5 lakh from the bank.
And they started sewage dress, cleaning busines.
In relation to my cleanliness campaign, I had said that cleanliness campaign is such that new interpreneur will be prepared.
And Shailesh Bhosale did it.
They have brought a tanker to that work and I was told that in such a short time, they also returned the bank.
After all, this is the intention under our MRA scheme.
Someone told me about Bhopal's Mamta Sharma that she received 40 thousand rupees from the bank from this Prime Minister MRA scheme.
He is working to make Batuva.
And makes Batuva but first he used to bring money from more interest and used to run the business with great difficulty.
Now because of the good amount of money coming together, he made his work more good.
And earlier, due to extra interest and, and due to reasons, due to the higher expenditure, these money came in their hands, every month almost a thousand rupees were saved.
And his family started growing a good business gradually.
But I would like to be more propaganda of the plan.
All our banks are more sensitive and help smaller people.
In fact, these people run the economy of the country.
People who do small work are the economic power of the country's meaning.
We want to emphasize that.
Good, but it's better to do.
On the birth anniversary of my dear countrymen, on October 31, Sardar Patel, I had discussed "A Indo-Best India".
This is what should remain consistent awareness in society life.
Rashtrayam Jagrayam Vyama I
Enternal vigilance is the Prior of Liberty Country's unity should continue this ritual Sarita.
"A Indo-Best India, I want to give it a plan."
MyGov asked for suggestions on it.
How's the programme structure
What are the people
How did public participation grow
What shape
I said for all the suggestions.
I was told that enough suggestions are coming.
But I expect more suggestions.
I expect a lot of specific scheme.
And I have been told that those who participate in it are going to get certificates.
No major preies have also been announced.
You also put your creative mind.
How can this mantra of unity integrity make "A Indo-Best India" connecting this mantra to one Hindustani"
What are the plans, how are the programs
Be sweet, be magnificent, be lifelong and easy to connect everyone.
What should the government do
What should the society do
What do Vivil Society do
There may be many things.
I'm sure your suggestions will work.
My dear brother-in-law, the cold weather is starting but the fun of eating in the cold comes.
It's fun to wear clothes, but I will urge you to exercise.
I will be urging to keep the body fit for some time, it will definitely use good weather exercises for him.
And create an environment in the family, it is a festival of the family, it is to do all one hour together.
You see what kind of consciousness comes.
And how much the body supports throughout the day.
So there is a good weather, then it will also be a good habit.
My dear countrymen once again wish very much.
Jaihind
