On 15th day, the coincidence of the Monkey Bath program - the voice of the mind.
My dear folks, sweetheart, this year's good rainy season.
I'm glad that it will certainly be helpful in the productive activity of our agricultural brothers before.
And one thing makes my mind happy.
In our country there is a huge deficiency of pulses and oil products.
There is a need for pulses for harvests to be included in swords.
50 percent increase in pulses is found in this process .
I am very pleased that only 33 percent yield is found in species of oil .
I'm supposed to demonstrate my familiar life to my agricultural brothers about this matter.
My favorite folks, the history of our country, the 26th month of July, have been marked as a successful day in the war in Carcel.
The extent of the relationship between the farmers of the country is connected to the land, the feelings of the fighters who live in the same way are also connected to this land.
In Corbell, every valor has made a lot of enemies on hundreds of enemies.
Don't fuck your innocence, thank me several hundred soldiers of the valorous military forces who foiled the enemy's evil efforts.
The war in Corbell is not just on the border.
Each village and city of India has been given the contribution of sympathy .
Mothers and sisters of the soldiers who surrendered in this war were also involved in it.
The yellow and artistic daughters on the neck have also participated in this summit .
Military heroes have also participated in the parents who sent your son to go.
The sons who started walking about father's brass were also participating in it.
Because of the sacrifices of the tribes, today the head of India is roaming in the world gallery.
In the same way, on the hot day of the war in Corbell, we're demonstrating my hundreds of deeds to our brave heroes who sacrificed the trick.
On 26th July, I think I'm a matter of greater importance.
After our government was established in 2014, we started the mygov combination site on the 26th day of July in a few months.
We're sure we're supposed to possess the participation of people in the public vision.
It's our regulation that every dweller should be engaged in development work.
Around two crore people have gone to the mygov synthesis just over a decade in the state, but only 512 lakh people know their opinions in it.
More than 50,000 people have brought their suggestions in the PMO application and have spent their golden time for this, and that your child is enjoying it.
They're absurd of it with great importance.
They're giving very good advice.
Akhilesh Wazbei, who belonged to Kanpur, has recorded a good blackmail.
It is that the Railways Department's IRCTC can provide a travel routine in the disposal system.
How is it the right to meet the same places to meet others in order to get physically challenged and travel
Maybe something simple.
But those who are in the kingdom in this connection haven't even noticed.
But with the advice of brother Aklesh Wazbei, the government's end, we're still doing it.
Logo, Tag Ligns, plans, formulate principles, any plans of the government today.
Mygov consistential libraries are obtained very designed advice.
A new southern wind has started in the administration.
A fresh feeling.
Even now, on the 15th of August, I've started receiving advice from MyGov Mukhri.
The Susidra Association of Madras has brought me several suggestions .
She's asking for women to keep children studying, pure Ganges, pure India.
It's stuck an idea in my mind.
This way on the 15th day of August, you can record your opinions that I should talk about
Let's send it to Mygov Mukhri, write to the Radio, send it to the Prime Minister's Office.
It's the best idea I've got to get from the public about what place I should get in touch for the 15th month of August.
Sure you think you're giving me the ideas.
I'd like to express my concern about a thing.
I didn't want to give any advice, at the same time I didn't find any way to protect the Central-Matrical States or visional institutions from your responsibility and debts.
Two days ago my child went on a disaster in Delhi.
After that accident, the person who traveled to Squator was split up for ten minutes.
He didn't get any help.
People are asking me in many occasions that you have to talk about road safety, be aware.
Apart from Akshay of Hosh Kot of Bangalore, Amai Joshi of Pune, Brussenna Kagunje of Murpitra of Karnataka State, many others have expressed their concern about this matter .
It's okay for all of you.
If we shut up the points, the heart's gonna stop.
There's been an accident every minute in our country.
Due to road accident, there's a death for 4 minutes.
The most worrying thing is that one part of the 3 years of death is 15 to 25 years.
Every death posesses their families.
Resolution, it must be done only by commitment.
But I'm asking for parents to have a circumventure related to the fact that the kids drive 2 square vehicles, 4 square vehicles, anyway, all the security related documents should be dealt with in the family.
We've seen some auto rickshaws have been written in the back of the dad, quick home.
It's kind of touching the heart, right
Government has also made several points of view regarding this matter.
Be aware of road safety, road construction related research, legal embarrassment, accident, treatment of immunity to those injured, which we are bringing them to the rescue and security hospital in mind.
In the days to come, we are planning to take several important efforts to absorb the national level road safety system and road safety system.
And we're doing an act, that's Cashals treatment, that's not treating money.
On the national highways like Kundgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, Mumbai, Ranchi, we are giving importance to the cachels treatment.
According to this, if we don't have any money, we're gonna have to think about the most important life saving activity in the first 50 hours, how to get it.
All matters such as 1033, umbulance facility, like free phones, as may be relating to the events happening across the country.
But all this must happen after the accident.
We must first guess it in the eye of how the accidents are not happening.
It's really worth every life.
I'll tell you sometimes that workers should be pregnant.
In the past few days, I'm afraid of some possibilities touching my mind with this blackness.
If you don't want to interfere, then the wizards will get tired.
It can be thought a few years later that , as soon as the device is available , the work can be seen later .
But in the past few days, there was also information about a television working on the railway.
In the Nakpur division, a visit visitor named Vijay Biswal works.
He has a lot of dance to the painting.
He might have gone to the picture anywhere.
But he's making the railway job his head.
In the same way, he's enjoying his regular work on the railway, he's coming in with many types of paintings related to the railway.
He's enjoyed on one side, on the other hand, he's doing his job, drama and drama.
It's a good idea to see how he can bring you alive even in his work.
By Vijay Biswale, he shows how his dance, his artist, his openings can be joined with his work.
I believe Vijay Biswal's picture can be a thing that speaks in the days to come.
And I felt a thing.
My mind is touched by a big team of government officials affiliated to Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
They've finished an operation called Operation Constipation.
Through this he has made a new thrill to the pure India plan.
By laying the Raksha Bandhan bandage , making the comfortable comfort for his sister , a campaign named " Bradhar Nammer Ohn " has also been made in the whole district .
Each brother has accepted the sacrificial pleasure for not letting any mother or sister spend the natural resources on the open outside of the entire district .
Look, how did Raksha Bandan's stuff change
I'm demonstrating my mental life to the total team of government officials of Harda district.
I've heard a thing right now.
In some cases, some small things are also very pleasant.
That's why I'm taking them away with you.
There is a village named Keshal in Rajnandka adjoining Chhattisgarh state .
It's been a drive to settle toilets for the last few months.
Now the people of that village do not have to spend natural resources on the open open .
This is not what happened, but when it was fulfilled, it was celebrated in the whole village just like a big fair.
It's just an adventure that they've been engaged in adventure.
The best specimens come to know how the survival of the social life changes, how people's eyes get affected, how the citizens of the country take the path to progress.
Powesh Dey associated with Guwahati is writing about the problems of meeting Northeastern states .
The residents of the north-eastern states are very sustainable, and they're telling me their ideas.
There is a prime minister for the people of the north-eastern state .
When Atal Bihari Wazbei was the Prime Minister of the country, a headquarter named DONER was formed, that it means the state of progress of the north-eastern states.
Well, we can't decide the welfare of the north-eastern states sitting in Delhi, right
Therefore, a team of Indian government officials went to the north-eastern region of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Sikkim.
There's seven days ahead.
Going to villages and villages, they met the responsibilities of the museum.
People spoke to the representatives.
Citizens know the ideas.
Listening to the problems, they understood the partition of the Government of India in the face of defeating them.
After our government's responsibility, we have fulfilled it with an important decision in this DONER Ministry.
This is the endeavor to make good results in the coming days.
All these beautiful regions, so many of these neighbouring people, after seeing all this, they should be advanced, they should have solved the problem that the officers who went there had a feeling in their minds, had a guarantee.
Even after they returned to Delhi, that part became easy to understand the problems of the people.
It's an endeavor, an attempt to go from Delhi to remote areas.
That's what I call the ACT EAST principle.
This is what makes me so much joy.
My dear folks enjoy me the success of the Several Plant Travel Plant.
In the past few days, India has poured five artificial planets of the country through its PSLV C82.
This is the very கனed artifact that has come to India so far.
Even if this message is not one of the most focusing attractions, it's the biggest achievement.
Sometimes when we raise up what you want when you grow up to the younger community of the country, the hundreds of people answered that I'm a scientist.
It's a matter of concern to see the lack of dance related to science.
The significance of scientific activity is the basis of development .
Our new headline scientists have to dream, drag research and intelligence, they need to be encouraged, know about their skills - this is the biggest requirement.
Under this, the Indian Human Development Corporation has started a national invention campaign .
The former President of our country, Sambamb, has started it.
Indian Technical Corporations - IITs , National Technical Corporations - NITs , Central-Matrical Welfare Corporations are functioning as Mentor-Districts.
Whatever is possible, these structures show their endeavour on encouraging students, guiding, helping them all over there.
You're far ahead studying gradually, you also spend about one and a half hours in the week as encouraging students belonging to your school and clubs, take your experiences away from them, it will definitely be helpful to them that I'm asking the officers of the Government of India.
Our villages should get electricity 24 hours, right
Even if this work is hard, it must be completed.
It's supposed to be broken.
In the days to come, all the villages should be sure to provide 24 hours of electricity, while studying in education and students, there should be no restriction on electrical irregularity, when there are small industries in the villages, we have to get electricity.
In today's situation, even if the mobile needs to be charged, it's gonna be another village.
The resources available to the cities should also be expanded to the villages, to get rid of these facilities for marketing.
Its composition is that we are starting the scheme of 'Thina Upadyai Gram Jodi ' .
Our country's largest country, there are twelve thousand villages, to ensure electricity supply to most remote areas.
But they must be finished for hard work.
Let's start it, surely finish it.
Today, the mind appeared to be expressing many kinds of things in the hole.
In some way the months of August - September are celebrated in our country for the months of festivals .
My familiar lives for all of you before these dresses.
You must send your advice to me before the 15th month of August.
Your ideas will be fair to me.
Thank you so much.
