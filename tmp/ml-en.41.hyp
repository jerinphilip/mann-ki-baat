Prime Minister Mr.
On the 20th of September 2015, the Tamilnadu language of the special launch conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population at 11 a.m.
My dear countrymen.
All of you are greeted.
This is the twelfth section of the 'Mon Ki Bath' program.
Let's say it's been a year.
Last year, on October 3, I had the luck to show 'Mon Ki Bath'.
A year through Manki Ba.
Many things.
I don't know what you got from it.
But I'm sure I can tell you I've achieved a lot.
People's opinions in democracy are paramount.
This is the basic faith in my life.
So, I have immense faith in public power.
But, 'Man Ki Bath' taught me, I knew, I felt I could tell you about it, and we were more people's power than we believed.
Our ancestors used to say, 'Janat Janardhana' means God's voice is the voice of the people.
My experiences in the 'Man Ki Bath' program can be told that our ancestors have a great power and truth.
Because I realized it.
I used to ask people's instructions for 'Man Ki Bati'.
I had only two or four suggestions every time.
But millions of people were actively giving me instructions.
This partner is a great power.
But sent a message to the Prime Minister, mygov.
I wrote a note, burnt it.
But I didn't get a chance once.
Anybody's been disappointed if you think so
But I didn't feel like that.
Yeah, yeah.
These millions of letters taught me a great lesson.
I've been receiving information about the magnificent trousers of the rule.
I appreciate the sky to see the common man's idea and appreciation without seeing these suggestions in paper pieces.
The sky has made many programs on these letters.
We invited the government's various departments.
Ordinary people presented things in front of them.
I tried to solve a lot of things.
Different departments in the circular have discovered the letters of the people and found out what things make people trouble and what the government doesn't care.
A lot of matters began to reach the government from the bottom.
And it's true that the information should come down from the bottom to the upper and downward directions.
Did anybody ever think that this is the source of 'Mon Ki Bath'
But it happened.
That's how Man Ki Bath made a chance to show the power of the Empire.
I told you a day with selfie and I was surprised all over the world.
Someone from all the corners of the world took the daughter with selfie.
Millions of people took photographs with girls and raised their courage and faith.
Girls got respect in society.
At the same time, the family has increased the resistance of girls.
And those who saw these pictures seem to have abandoned the fate of girls.
It was a silent revolution.
I meant India's tourism, I said that you are also traveling incredible Indian brothers.
I'll see if you get good pictures.
That's a little bit of things.
But the reactions were surprised.
People from every corner of India sent millions of pictures.
Ourselves have so much heritage, perhaps the tourism departments of the Government of India or the State Government have no idea.
Man Ki Bath is a stage and the government has taken a job without spending a rupee.
I felt happy to remember Gandhiji in my first Man Ki Bath program on October last year.
When I recommended Gandhiji, I used to advise people to celebrate the production of Khadi in the country on the birthday of 2 October Mahatma Gandhi.
There was a time called Khadi for the nation.
Now, according to the change of time, don't you want it to fashion
I wanted people to buy slaves, and I wanted to do something.
After that, I'm glad to say that Khadi's sale was almost double.
This wasn't done by government advertisements.
Lacs and crores haven't been spent.
A feeling of public power
This is a victory.
Once I said in 'Man Ki Bati', smokes stiff at the poor's house, the children cry.
Moms are sorry.
They don't have to get cooking clients
I asked the rich you could not leave the subsidies.
Today, I can say with great pleasure, 30 lakh families in our country have left the subsidies of cooking.
They're not very much.
A T.
V.
I saw a retired school teacher in the channel staying in the ue to keep a widowed woman subsidi.
The middle class, the lower ones, are difficult to leave the subsidi.
But such people have left the subsidies.
Isn't this silence
We can't see the power of the people.
The government has to include a large public power-powered and energy-sensitivity society outside this chattakku, what's happening in our government's clutches.
How many governments work together with society can act as a good motivation for social transformation.
Whatever thing I had in 'Man Ki Bath' was expecting, today it's all faith, it has become respectful.
That's why I enjoy a hundred people's power through the program 'Man Ki Bath'.
I swore every little thing and shared the good works of the country.
What else do you want to do with this
I thought about a new experiment this time in Man Ki Bait.
I'm supposed to include 'Man Ki Bati' if you're telephoned to the people of the country.
I'm glad I've received more than 50 messages.
Well, if you're from Siach, you'll be from the kachch, you'll be from Kashmere or from Kanyakumari.
People don't have any phone calls in India.
That's a comfortable feeling.
People from all ages have sent messages.
I wanted to hear some messages myself.
I liked it.
My team takes action on the rest.
You spent only one or two minutes for that.
But your phone call about me, your message is very important.
All the departments of the government will certainly consider your instructions.
But something surprised me and enjoyed me.
Sometimes it seems that we're innocent.
But I've lost my experience.
These fifteen thousand people said their way.
There was no obstacle.
I could've said anything.
But I'm surprised.
Everything was like the idea of 'Man Ki Bati', which was completely energy-productive and creative.
It can be understood by the fact that the country's ordinary people think so vitally.
How big wealth is this about the country
Perhaps only one or two phone calls will be seen after serious complaints.
There were more than 90 percent of the enjoyment of a kind of energy.
The other thing I care, especially the discrepancies, the limited visions, their relatives, had received a lot of phones.
They must have heard the radio.
I realized how important the radio deserves about them.
I see a new side of it.
They said so good things.
It's enough to enhance the government's capacity.
He sent me a message from Alwar in Rajasthan.
I think the words of the priest must be heard all over the country.
Look, surely listen to what he wants to say.
My name is Poon Acharya.
I'm the Alwar country of Rajasthan.
Prime Minister Mr.
This is my message for them, please, please, request the people of India to use Deepawali with the best fountains through the Man Ki Bath program.
It will make thousands of soil-planted brothers an opportunity to get jobs with the environment.
Thank you.
I believe your emotions will reach India's back and corner like a pioneer.
It's a good suggestion.
It's not expensive if it's soil.
So the sounds are invaluable.
It has a special significance in the territorial view.
These lamps are built in the poor house.
Communists do this everyday work.
I say to the natives, if we pursue the words of the Pawan Acharya in the festivals that come, its single lamp will be light in their homes, but it will be in the poor's house.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army.
With our army protecting the sea-cross.
50 years of war with Pakistan in 1965.
In the name of this, a 'Shauryanjali' exhibition was organized at India Gate in Delhi.
I don't care very interestingly.
It's half an hour ago.
But when he returned, he didn't know it was two and a half hours.
And yet, something's gone.
What wasn't there
The whole history is alive.
It's best to look at the beauty.
Any historical view is fascinating.
It doesn't matter to inspire life and to serve for the motherland.
In the pride of the war, we heard about the sacrifice of incredible courage and self-determination of our soldiers.
So many pictures weren't available that day.
There wasn't such a videography.
There's only a miracle from this exhibition.
The scenes of victory in Hajipar Pass will be thrilling if the war is in Hajipur or in the supremacy of Chamindai.
I'm proud of the soldiers of our army.
I've seen the brave families.
I've seen the families dedicated to the country.
They're all in the evening of life after they're part of the war.
They came.
I thought they were slaughtering.
Hi, what energy is.
Like giving a proclamation.
If you want to make history, it's mandatory to know and understand the microscopics of history.
History connects us with our roots.
If the relationship with history is lost, the possibilities of history will also be completely disappearable.
This exhibition makes sense of history.
It's known about history.
The seeds of inspiration for creation of new history are wiped out.
If you're surrounded by Delhi, I'll be waiting for you and your family for a few more days.
I'm sure you're gonna see.
Don't shit like me.
I went back in two and a half hours.
But you must spend three hours there.
Surely enjoy yourself.
If you see the power of democracy.
A little boy asked the Prime Minister
In the funeral.
But the boy forgot to tell his name in the midst of a man.
So I don't know his name.
But he said that the Prime Minister should take as much seriously as possible.
We must see all the countrymen seriously.
Listen to what that kid told us.
I want to tell you, Chief Minister Motiji.
If you want to appreciate your will, you can rotate everywhere and every street.
That kid's right.
We must be a nature of purifying.
I felt very happy in the message of that child.
Because, on October 2, I was announced to organize an initiative for purity India.
Perhaps for the first time since Independence, I can tell you that there have been so many discussions on the purity of the Parliament for hours.
The Prime Minister and the Government are saying big things about purifying.
And I've heard the observations that happened.
I don't think it's bad.
I've been discussing the virtue of India even in the good parlment I've seen in it.
On the other hand, on one side, a child on the other side of this country speaks about purifying.
What else is the greatest generosity of a country
This revolution of ideas creates an atmosphere of hate for filth.
Aware of purifying.
It'll be forced to work for governments.
The local jurisdiction can be village panchayat, district panchayat, municipality, corporation, state, or country.
Every person has to work for it.
We have to lead this revolution forward.
We have to take the crimes and deficiencies.
In 2019, when we celebrate the 150th victory of Mahatma Gandhi, we have to take this job to the dreamers of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi said
If peace and freedom were to be chosen one of these, I would first choose purifying, then freedom.
Gandhiji gave the importance of freedom to purify himself.
Come, let's go together to convince the words of Mahatma Gandhi and move together for his wishes.
Gulshan Arora mygov from Delhi.
He wants to know about Dien Dayalji's birth centenary.
My dear folks, the life of great men is always proclaiming us.
We don't have to guess what the great men were followers of thinking.
Every person who lives and dies for the country is inspiration.
These days there are occasions to remember a lot of great men.
On September 25, Pandit Deen Dayal, on October 2, Mahatmagadi, Lal Bahadur Scientist Jaiprakash Narayan on October 11, Sardar Vallabhai Patel on October 31.
I'm very supposed to be very little.
Because it's a country of heroes.
Whatever day you take, a great man's name will be lightened through the history door.
We'll remember all the great men in the coming days, honor them.
Let's try to bring home their lifestyle.
Let's try to learn something from them.
On October 2, I'm gonna take one more voyage.
On October 2, the honorable father's victory.
I told you last year.
There may be different types of fashioned clothes.
There may be different clothing.
But there must be a place for Khad.
I'm telling you again.
There's Khadki rebate for a month from October 2.
If you use it, give equal importance to handcuffs with khadi.
My brothers are studying very much.
When we buy something worth Rs.125 crores of natives, five or ten thousand rupees, the whole amount will reach the houses of the poor neighbours.
I'm gonna get to the poor widow's house.
That's why this lamp will surely pay you everybody's house and body.
I'll never force you to wear dresses.
A little, I'm so funny.
Look, the last time the sale is almost double.
Some poor people got the benefit.
It's the best quality that the government does not even advertise lakhs and crores of rupees, you've got from each other's small help.
This is the power of the people.
So I'm asking you to continue the work once more.
Lovely countrymen, I'm happy with one thing.
I share it with you.
When I went to Calcutta in May, the family of Subhash Chandra Bose came to see me.
It was his desert who arranged everything.
I've got a chance to spend a lot of time with Subhas Chandra Bose's family.
The big family of Subhashbaba was decided on the day of Prime Minister's visit.
Chandra Bose and his family went ahead with that decision.
I was sure that Subhas Baba's family, more than 50, came to the Prime Minister's residence last week.
You can imagine how happy those moments I'll be.
Neetaji's family, perhaps, would be the first time in their lives, together with everyone, have a chance to come to the prime minister's place.
But it makes me happy that there was never a lucky luck in the prime minister's dwelling.
I'm going to get it in October.
More than 50 families of Subhash Chandra Bose live in different countries.
Everyone's coming.
I'll have a moment of joy.
I'm very happy to accept them.
I feel very enjoyable.
I got a message from the Lord View.
When I heard their voices, they said they were a leader.
Perhaps he's going to be the leader, that's what he thinks.
Get my name back to Pargavi.
I want you to know that the young woman should be aware of the Voters Registration.
In the coming days, the partnership of the youth will increase and in the future, the government will have more participation in the elections and the administration.
Thank you.
Bhargwai said the matter of having a name in the Voters list and voting.
You're very right.
Each voter in democracy is the ruler of the country.
This is awakening.
The percentage of voting continues to increase.
I want to appreciate the election commission of India in particular.
A few years ago, we met our Electoral Communication only a regulator.
But for the last few years, it has changed.
Today our election committee is not a regulator.
In a way, it turned into a facilitator.
Voters are friendly.
In all their thoughts, plans, the committees have become the main point.
This is a very good change.
But it doesn't matter if the election commission is working.
We and schools, colleges and streets, have to keep the environment warm.
We have to change the situation of awakening just when the election comes.
Renew the list of the defendants.
We have to take care of it too.
What power I have got, whether that authority is safe or not, whether we use power or not, we have to maintain habits.
I wish the young people of the country don't have a name on the voter list and use their vote.
Normally, I want to say that the first day of the election is voting and drinking water.
It's a pure thing.
Everyone must do that.
I went to Kashi for a while.
I saw a lot of people.
A lot of work has been done.
I want to share with you only about two children to see so many people.
One, seven-year-old Kshitij Pandey, studying at 7th class at Banaras Hindu University.
Very funny.
His self-confidence was surprised.
I saw his taste of physics in such a short time.
He must have read a lot.
Internet must have been surfing.
You must have introduced new uses.
How can the railroads stop
What technology can reduce energy
How can he lose information about machine men talk about things like that
It's amazing.
Well, however fine and truthful was what he said.
But I tried to look at his self-confidence.
It was his taste.
I want our country to grow scientific and interest in children.
There must be questions in the mind of the children.
Why
How
When
Such children are asking for themselves.
And I saw a little girl named Sonn Patel.
It's 9 years old.
The daughter of the Sadavrit City living in the place of Sundarpur in Varanasi.
A very poor family member.
I was surprised.
The boy had a lesson to watch Geeta.
But the big thing I asked her about the world and explained in English and said it was in Hindi.
When she asked her father, she said that it's been saying since 5.
I asked, where did I learn
They don't know.
So I asked you, what else did you study
Is Geeta just saying, has you made any sense
And then they said, when the calculation takes place once it's evening, it'll be a lesson.
Even though history, it will teach everything in the evening.
They said they'd be surprised.
They don't know what's inside her.
In fact, it's impressed me.
Sometimes some kids have a celebrity experiment.
Sonam didn't have that vision.
I thought God should have given her some power.
Two of these two kids were very important meetings on my Kashi Yatra.
So I thought I wanted to share with you.
We're doing a lot of things you don't see in TV and don't know by newspapers.
Sometimes I get a kind of joy through it.
My talk about these kids remains in mind.
A lot of people use me to do a lot of things like 'Man Ki Bati'.
Look, Sandeep in Haryana is to say this, can't you launch this 'Man Ki Bath' once a month
Because your words give us a lot of inspiration.
And Sandeepji, what are you doing to me now
What's the matter to do once a month
My time has to be arranged.
Friends of the sky have to wait half an hour.
But I respect your feelings.
It's locked up to this order.
It's a month's launch for the first time.
In a way, Man Ki Bathy has survived a year.
You know, how many people depended on Subhasbabu Radio.
The beginning from Germany.
The citizens of India were enlightened by radio about the freedom struggle.
The beginning of Azad Hind Radio was through the Revenue Warthabulti.
He had launched all the languages like English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathy, Punjabi, Pashto, Urudu.
A year has been completed by me and I have performed 'Man Ki Bath' through the sky.
My 'Man Ki Bath' program is true that you have become your 'Man Ki Bath'.
I'm thinking about you when you hear what you say.
My thoughts show it when you pass through your instructions.
That's where the sky goes through your ears.
I'm telling you, but I'm telling you.
That's my biggest pleasure.
We'll meet Man Ki Bati next month.
Let's keep your instructions coming.
Your suggestions are benefited by the government.
It starts a good change.
Your partner is valuable.
There's a lot of good luck once more.
Thank you.
