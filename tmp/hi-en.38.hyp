Talking to the mind, December 2015, my dear countrymen, greet you all.
2015 - In a way, my last word of this year.
The next "mind" will be in 2016.
Right now, we celebrate Christmas festival and now preparations for the new year's reception are going on.
India is full of diversity.
There is also a lot of festivals.
There was no festival that the other did not come.
In a way, every festival goes away from waiting for another festival.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where there is also "Tyour Riven Conomy".
This becomes the reason for the economic activity of the poor sections of the society.
All the countrymen on behalf of me also greet Christmas and also greet the New Year of 2016.
The year 2016 brought a lot of happiness to all of you.
New excitement, new enthusiasm, new resolution bring you to new heights.
The world is also free from the crisis, whether it is terrorism, whether it is global warming, whether there are natural disasters, even if there is a human creative crisis.
What can be the happiness of human race Sukhchan's life
You know that I continue to use Technologi with a lot of information.
MyGov. I'm very close to this portal.
Sriman Ganesh V. Savaleshwarkar from Pune, he has written to me that this season is the season of Tourist.
Tourists from India and abroad come in large quantities.
People also go to Christmas holidays.
In the field of Tourism, attention is given to all the facilities, but he has said that where there is Tourist Stination, Tourist Place is Travel Dham, there is a migration dham, there should be special insistence regarding cleanliness.
As clean as our tourist destination, India's image will be good in the world.
I welcome Ganesh ji's ideas and I am delivering Ganesh ji's talk to the countrymen and anyway we call "Guest Devo Bhav", then when the guest is coming here, how much courage and cleanliness in the house We do.
So at our tourist destination, at the tourist festival, on our travel shrines, it is really a special force work.
And I am also happy that there are frequent news about cleanliness in the country.
I thank the media friends in this matter from Day One, because they keep such small, good things in front of the people by searching for them.
Right now I read a thing in a newspaper.
I would like to tell the countrymen.
A elderly artisan Dilip Singh Malviya in Bhojpura village of Sehore district of Madhya Pradesh.
Now they are normal artisans who work as messons, wages.
He did such a unique thing that the newspaper published a story of his.
And when I came to my notice, I also felt that I would reach this point to you.
Dilip Singh Malviya of the small village, he decided that if a material provides in the village, then the laborers will not be able to build toilets and they will make toilets while working as Messon free.
In Bhojpura village, he has constructed 100 toilets so far by accepting this work without his hard work, without wages.
I congratulate Dilip Singh Malviya with great heart, congratulate.
Sometimes the things of disappointment in relation to the country.
But in this country, Dilip Singh is doing something good with his methods.
This is the strength of the country.
This is the hope of the country and this is the things that move the country forward and then it seems very natural to pride Dilip Singh in the matter of "mind".
The result of the tireless efforts of many people is that the country is moving very fast.
By joining the footsteps, one hundred and fifty million people are moving forward, they are also moving the country forward.
New opportunities for better education, best skills and employment.
Whether it is a matter of bringing citizens from insurance cover to banking facilities.
Provide convenient arrangements for improving, business and doing new business on Case of Business on the global panel.
People of the general family who never reached the bank's door, provided easy loan under the Modra Yojana.
When every Indian knows that the whole world has attracted yoga and when the world celebrated "International Yoga Day" and the whole world was added, then we were born to believe that Wow, this is neither Hindustan.
When this feeling arises, it happens when we see the vivid form.
Who will forget the incident of Yashoda Mata and Krishna, when Shri Balakrishna opened his mouth and presented Yashoda to the mother of the whole universe, then he realized the power.
The incident of yoga has given the realization to India.
The matter of cleanliness is echoing at home in a way.
The participation of citizens is also increasing.
After so many years of independence, the village in which electricity pillars reach, perhaps people living in the city, or those who consume electricity will never have the idea that if the darkness is sorted then what is the limit of enthusiasm and excitement
The Government of India and the Energy Department of the State Governments used to work before, but since the resolution of 1000 days to reach the villages and every day it comes to know that electricity has reached that village today, electricity has reached that village, at the same time there are reports of enthusiasm and enthusiasm of that village.
So far, it has not been discussed in the media widely, but I am sure that the media will reach such villages and what is the enthusiasm there, it will introduce the country and the biggest benefit will be that the government's welfare is doing this work, they will get so much satisfaction, so much happiness will be that they have done something that is going to change the lives of a village, someone's life.
Farmers, poor, young, women, should all these things reach them or should not reach
It should not be possible to reach what government did and what government did not work
It should be reached so that if he is entitled to this, then do not give the right.
He should not even be informed to get his right .
We all should try to reach the right things, good things, things of normal human work, as many people reach.
This is also the job of a service.
I have also made a small effort to do this work in my way.
I can't do everything alone.
But whatever I am saying, I should do anything.
A general citizen can also join me by downloading the Narendra Modi app on his mobile phone.
And I keep sharing such small things on it.
And it is a matter of happiness for me that people also tell me a lot of things.
You must also join your way in this effort, reach 100 million people.
How will I reach without your help
Come, let us all together bring things about the interests of the common man, the language of the common man and inspire them, to get things of their rights.
My dear young companions, from the Red Fort on August 15, I Start-up I
Endia, Stand-up I
Andia had a primary discussion about her.
After that this thing went on in all the departments of the government.

Whether it is in manuacturing, whether it is in service sector, whether it is in agriculture.

Ts, wherever there is a young generation, they all will be added to this program through Live-connectivity.
In relation to Start-up, we have become a thought tied up here.
Like digital world or I
T professor, this start-up is for them
No, we have to make changes according to India's needs.
The poor man wages somewhere, he has physical labor, but no young man
Make a thing through annovation that poor get some facility in the wages.
I believe this is Start-up too.
I will tell the bank that help such a young man, I will also ask him to move forward with courage.
Market will be found.
In the same way is the intellect of our younger generation - is limited in a few cities
This thinking is wrong.
In every corner of India, young people have talent, they need opportunities.
This Start-up I
Endia, Stand-up I
India should not be limited to some cities, should spread in every corner of India.
And I am also urging the State Governments to move this matter forward.
On January 16, I will definitely talk to you in detail and will always be welcome to your suggestions.
Dear young companions, January 12 is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda ji
There are people of this country like me who have been getting inspiration from Swami Vivekananda
Swami Vivekananda Jayanti is celebrated as National South India since January 12 , 1995 .
This year, it will be held from 12 January to 16 January in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
And I got the information that this time they have theme, because they have this weekend they're very good I
The Indian South on Development skill and Harmony, I was told that from all the states, from the corner of India, more than 10 thousand young people will be gathered.
The view of a small India is going to be born there .
Youth India's scene is going to be born
The flood of dreams is coming in a way .
The resolution is going to be realized
Can you give me your suggestions regarding this South Eastern

Nitiative by you. Dilip ji, thank you very much.
And you ' re already working in this area
You understand these things well and you will have many difficulties too.
Sometimes there is an opportunity to meet such a person in society, so there are many ideas in our mind.
According to our thinking , we also express our view of seeing it .
There are many people who lose their organ due to the accident.
There are some people that there is no damage to the congenital .
And for such people many words have been used in the world, but always there has been contemplation for these words.
Every time people felt that no-no-no, this word does not look good for them, it does not look respectable.
And you must have seen how many words have come.
Sometimes the words used to hear anticaped, and sometimes they heard the words, and sometimes Specially abled Persons - many words come.
It is true that words also have one of their own significance
This year when the Indian government started the easy India campaign, I was about to go to that program, but in some districts of Tamil Nadu and especially in Chennai due to the severe floods, I was not able to live in that program on that day.
But if I had to go to that program, then I had some ideas in my mind.
So at that time I had thought that God who has given any deficiency in the body, has given any damage, one organ is not working properly - we call him disabled and know as a disabled person.
But sometimes they come to know that we see a lack of eyes, but God has given him a letter power.
A separate power has been represented by God in him .
Those who can't see from their eyes, but when they see it, they pay attention to their ability.
Hey Wow
How does this do
Then I thought that from the eye, we think that perhaps he is disabled, but the experience feels that he has any extra power, extra power.
And then I thought in my mind, why don't we use the word "Divyang" in place of disabled in our country
These are those people who have such an organ or more than one such organ, in which there is divineity, communication of divine power, which we do not have the normal body.
I like this word very good .
Can my countrymen prevail the word "Divyang" at the place of habitual disabled
I hope you will carry this thing forward.
That day we have launched the " Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan "
under this we both physical and virtual - kind of I
I ' ll improve the nrastructure and make them comfortable for the people of the world .
School, hospital, government office, bus stand, ramps in railway station, accessible parking, accessible lights, Braille script
How many things are I
EI to make it easy in all of these
Need annovation, should takenology, arrange, should be sensitivity
I have taken the lead of this work
Public participation is also getting I
People feel good
You can also join it in your own way .
My dear countrymen, the plans of the government continue to come continuously, but it is very important that the plans should always be proud.
Schemes should be alive to the last person
They should not be dead in files
After all, the plan is made for the common man, for the poor person
In the past , the Government of India made an effort to gain simplest benefits to the entitlement of the scheme .
Subsidy is given in gas cylinders in our country
Crores of rupees go to it but it was not the account that those beneficiaries are reaching the same or not.
Are not accessing at the right time I
Government made a slight change in this
Public money account, be Aadhar card, with the help of all these, access subsidy directly to the beneficiaries' bank account through the world's largest, longest airport benefit Transfer Scheme
I am proud of telling the countrymen that it has just got place in the "Ginness Book of World Records" that the world's largest Virect Benefit Transfer Scheme, which has been successfully implemented.
"The scheme is prevalent in the name of the first and the experiment has been very successful
By the end of November, nearly 15 crore PG consumers have become beneficiaries of "Fear" scheme, in the account of 15 million people, government money has started going straight into bank accounts.
No intermediaries, no recommendation, no possibility of corruption
On one hand, the campaign of Aadhaar card, opening public money accounts on the other hand, preparing a list of beneficiaries of the state government and the Government of India on the third side.
Add them to the base and the account
This is going on.
These days, MNREGA, which gives employment opportunities in the village, was the money of MNREGA, very complaining
In many places, he has now started collecting direct money in the account of the wagesman.
Students also had many difficulties in schoolship, complaints were also coming, they have started now, will gradually move forward.
So far, about 40 thousand crores have started going directly to the beneficiary's account through different schemes.
I have a fat-fat estimate, nearly 35 to 40 schemes are now being included directly inside Benefit Transfer
My dear countrymen, January 26 - A golden moment of Republic Day of India
It is also a pleasant coincidence that this time Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the producer of our Constitution, is his 125th birth anniversary.
There was a special discussion on the Constitution for two days in Parliament and I had a very good experience .
All parties, all MPs have considered the purity of the Constitution, the importance of the Constitution, the understanding of the Constitution in the right form - very good discussion
We should move this thing forward .
Republic Day can connect people to the system in the right sense, can you connect the system with the people
Our Constitution gives us a lot of rights and the rights are easily discussed and should be .
He has the same importance
But the Constitution also emphasizes the duty
But it ' s noticed that the discussion of duty is very little
When elections are held, there are advertising on all sides, walls are written, hoardings are imposed that voting is our sacred duty.
There is a lot of duty at the time of voting but why not talk of duty in easy life
When we are celebrating 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar this year, can we make in schools on January 26, in collages, in our villages, in your city, in different societies, organizations - Do the essays on this subject
If hundreds of millions of countrymen take one step after another with duty then how big history can be
But start with discussion
There is an idea in my mind, if you write me in the first duty of January 26, duty - in your language, after your language, if you have to write in Hindi, in English, then write poetry on duty in English, write essay on duty, write
Can you send me
I want to know your ideas
My Gov. Send me to this portal
I would like to think about the duty of the younger generation of my country .
He wishes to give a little suggestion.
26th January, when we celebrate Republic Day, by the citizens, by the children of school-college, the statues of the great men in our city have been settlement, cleaning it, cleaning that premises, best hygiene, best decoration can be done on 26th January
And I ' m not saying this on the official road
By the citizens, the great men we are so important to settue, but later we are equally indifferent to handle it.
As a society, as a country, can we make our intuitive nature, on 26th January, we all try to meet that respect the statues of such great men, cleanliness, cleanliness of the premises and all this by the people and the people, by the citizens.
Dear countrymen, once again of New Year, a lot of best wishes in 2016
Thank you very much
.
