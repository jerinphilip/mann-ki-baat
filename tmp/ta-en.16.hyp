Prime Minister Mr.
In the name of Narendra Moti Man Ki Bath , the coincidence of speeches in the public in the All India Radio , the voice of the mind .
10.
I'm folks, sweetheart.
The sacred day sat puja celebrated after 6 days after the end of Dipawali is one of the festivals celebrated with various rules and rituals .
In every matter, traditional arrangements are followed what to eat, what to lay.
This very early day of Sat-Pujayi had not mixed completely with Nature and Nature puja .
If the sun and water are filled with this sacred sat puja , soil dresses and priests are unparalleled with rituals of worship .
Besides the belief this sacred day is full of combined culture of worship , sun worship , blessing , worshipping sun .
The culture of administering the survivors of the world, despite the fact that it is sure to hide Sath-Puja.
The importance of satisfaction in our lives is also bound in this pavilion.
Before the satpura the house is cleaned , along with rivers , lakes , waterfalls , pilgrimages , pilgrimages etc . all are included in the sacred work .
Surya worship or sat-puja is the festival of environmental protection, disease relief, methodology etc.
Normally people consider it interesting , but after giving a devotion to water in the morning on the occasion of Sat-Puja , the special tradition of hunting the prasad is enjoyed .
The feeling of destruction of males is at the back of this composition that enjoys the prince.
This terrible civilization is very constraint in progress.
It is a natural thing that this great tradition of India can be gained .
My famous folks, praise the voice of the mind, also immerse.
But when I guess the influence of the heart of the people of this country, there has been unbelievable hope that the mind of the people of this country has created a connection with 100 percent.
You can only take the doors and handicrafts.
On the birthday of the Gandhians, I've always been talking about handcuffs and dresses, see what's the result
If you know this, you'll be happy.
On the 17th October of this month ' Tantheras ' festival the achievement of selling only one crore 20 lakh rupees in the Garodhyog Bhavan market of Delhi has been distributed .
The joy in the mind enjoys the joy of listening that it's only sold in a shop.
Only 680 percent growth has been recorded in the sale of ear gifts before Dibawali.
Only 90 percent increase in the total sale of ears and handicrafts is found .
Today, it shows that young people, old people, women, all the old men are wearing traitors and handicrafts like clothes.
I can imagine how many domestic families, complications, handicapped families will benefit from all.
In the past, the status of the traitors for the country changed the words of fashions .
But for the past few years after the traitors for the country , fashion for the traitors , etc . , I can say that now the status of traitors for change has arisen .
Catholics and handicrafts have made changes in the life of the supreme composition, making them an instrument to transform them into economically riches.
It's the biggest synthesis of the Gramodai sculpture.
In the center of the security forces, I must share the feelings of Deepavali, you have written that Narendramodyapple Rajan Butt, how they celebrate Deepavali festivals.
Do you know what Tejas Caegwatt wrote to them NarendermodiApple
- Is there any way to send sweets to the security personnel from our homes
Listen, all of us are remembered about our virtuous security forces.
You all celebrate Dipawali with great enthusiasm .
On the basis of me this method has also taken a special experience of Dipavali .
Once again, our external security forces, who were present in the border, were found to be celebrating the Rode Dibawali.
This time it was an unforgettable experience that the protector of Deepavali in the Kurj area of Jammu and Kashmir had taken place .
Our security forces defend ourselves from the struggle, dedication and decency of all the folks in front of the extremely difficult, complicated environments.
Whenever we meet, we have chances, we have to know the experiences of our security personnel, we have to seize their civilization.
Our security guards are not only in our borders, but many of us may not know that the whole world is engaged in many important works in peace.
I.
Nah.
Peace-carrier, they enjoy respect for India in the world.
I'll be worldwide the 24th October in the past.
Nah.
It's been played every day.
The world's peace is sustained.
Nah.
Everybody remembers its architecture in his efforts.
According to us, we're the "Vasuthav Family", that means the world's path of a family.
From the beginning, because of this conviction.
Nah.
We're supposed to be a composite participant in various important predecessors.
The political structure of India and I.
Nah.
You know that we begin with the words of Sasan and the people of Sasan.
India has always been pressurizing the woman's equation.
I.
Nah.
Men's rights are primarily proof of this.
It has been introduced in the first word, "All men are born free and equal", which has been designed as "All Human Beings are bare fee and equal" as a result of their efforts to India's representative Hansa Matha, that all human beings are born free and equal.
In superior India it can be seen as a small change but it shows a delicate idea .
I.
Nah.
If he says he's the biggest part of India, according to various functions, it's I.
Nah.
Let's say peaceful activities.
In the process of peace and safety of the United Nations Celebration, India has always been able to make its own part.
This information may have been new to you.
Indian security forces more than 18,000.
Nah.
They're engaged in peace work.
At present, only 7,000 soldiers of India came.
Nah.
They are attached to the peaceful ends, they are in number three more in the world.
Until the month of August 2017 , the warriors of India have provided their services in only 50 operations in the world 's 71 peaceful activities .
These activities are held in all parts of the world as Coria, Compotia, Lavos, Manimal, Congo, Cyprus, Laberia, Lebanon, Hoodane.
In Kango and Southern Centre the treatment of more than 2000 patients has been given by the military services of India .
The security forces of India are not only providing protection to those people but also in different countries but also in their hearts by the people's national activities.
The women of India have already taken the peace of the state.
In Laberia, it is known that India was the first country sent to the first female caretaker division through peacekeeping operation of the United States.
This activity of India is one of the most predictable things in the world.
After this, all the countries started sending women's guardians.
It is a matter of great importance that India has not only stood with the activities of peace evacuation, but it is also important that India is engaged in the work of peace and safety of only 85 countries to train the people.
Gandhians and cautious men have gathered with the message of peace , peace and comfort of the world from this earth.
It's not a simple activity.
Our security forces have to go to hard places.
It's possible to live among different people.
Several types of environments, different cultures must be understood.
You have to change yourself with the localities, environment.
Today we have our valor.
Nah.
If you remember peacekeepers, who can forget Captain Kurbachan Singh Salaria
They reigned peace in the Kango of Africa, paying all that belonged to themselves.
When you see him thinking, the folks wander in the gravity of everyone.
The only I was awarded Param Vir Chakra.
Nah.
The restrainer is the only one.
Lieutenant General Bramsant, one of the others who made a different mark for himself in Cyprus.
In 1998, the 72-year-old man was appointed by the Commander for the activities of Namibia, who dedicated his services to ensuring the freedom of Namibia.
General Timmaia, headed by the Indian military, in Cyprus.
Nah.
Responsive forces, peace has been fully engaged in the activities of the state.
India has always been delivering messages like peace, peace, peace, compassion, etc. in the world.
Everyone has to live peacefully, peacefully, our intention is to move forward in a direction of a special, peaceful future.
My folks, we have decorated many great men, who are engaged in human service with self-conscious feelings.
Brother didn't even swear one of those people.
Even if he was born with Margaret Elizabeth in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda named him Niveditha.
If it's supposed to be a complete dedicator.
During the creation, he dedicated himself to his name.
The 150th birthday of sister Niveditha.
He was very attracted by Swami Vivekananda, torturing his pleasant life, fulfilling his life as well as in the service of comrades.
Brother has been mentally impaired by the implications of the British rule.
The British didn't slaughter ourselves, they were engaged in trying to keep us alive.
In order to make our culture strong, the work of feeling down on our minds continued.
Brother Nivedita re-established the glory of the Indian culture.
Encouraged the nation's awareness and engaged in the unity of the people.
He went to different countries of the world and gave a voice to the wrong propaganda of sanctity and principles.
Renowned nationalists and Tamil literature supramania Bharati New Year's revolution in poetry, about the New Year Fendor, have depicted their coordination.
It is said that he was received from his sister Niveditha.
Brother Nivedida has helped great scientist Jagdishchandra Possess.
He's introducing Bose's research, spreading and enforcement through his articles and countries.
One of the most beautiful features of India is to fulfil spiritual and science .
Brother will, scientist Jagdish Chandra Poshum is an important example.
In 1899, there was a terrible black disease in Kolkata, in which thousands of people died.
My sister didn't make any sense of her health, started the work of cleaning the legs and streets.
He might have lived smoothly, but he's engaged himself in the service of comrades.
He was enjoyed by this sacrifice, and people began to share their share in the services.
He imagined a lesson about the importance of sanitation and service through his work.
Herr Reposess Sister Nivedita who went her all to India, that he's been dressed in his queue that he's all dedicated to India.
He lived like this without any sense.
This great ruler, every Indian dweller, learnt from his life, no more important memory than trying to seize himself on that service path, tonight.
The valuable prime minister is my name, Dr.
Burth Shah...
We celebrate children on the 14th day of November
Because it was his birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Javagar Lal Nehru...
.
That day we're selling the world diabetes every day...
.
Diabetes is only a disease occurring in old age, which affects many children...
.
What can we do to fight this shit
Thank you for calling your phone.
First of all, our first Prime Minister, Javagar Lal, celebrated the birthday of Nehru, before every day, all the children live for me.
Children are the great brothers of new India.
Your concern is right.
In the past, the diseases were very old, they were suffering in the last stage of life.
But they're buying kids today.
It is very surprised that children also suffer from diabetes .
In the past, these diseases are called royal diseases.
If the princess means that such diseases should come only to those who are delicate, who live in good life.
Such diseases were seen in young people as scratching .
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today we know that these diseases are lifestyle disturbances.
The main reason for adversity of such diseases in young age is the reduction of physical activities in our lifestyle and changes in food habits .
It is very important to pay attention to social and family matters.
If you think about it, you realize that there's no need to do anything extraordinaryly.
By changing our old habits, making small things right, we must make it ourselves naturally.
Children are engaged in the habit of playing in the open fields, the family members should be carefully tried.
If possible, the elders in the family can join these kids in the games.
Instead of using children liftype, climbing stairs can also be practiced.
Everyone in the family of the dinner can come walking with the children.
Yoga is especially a healthy lifestyle to our young people, it is also very beneficial to avoid lifestyle disturbances.
Look at yoga for 30 minutes before starting school, you feel how much it will be
It can also be done at home.
And the specific part of yoga is that it is easy, natural, can be done to all, because it can be done by any age.
Why do you say it's comfortable, it can easily learn why it's very easy, it can be done anywhere.
It doesn't need special equipment or fields.
Yoga is very beneficial in controlling diabetes , many researches have been done about this .
This is being conducted at the AIMS hospital so far as the results are found, they are very complicated.
We don't see Ayurveda and yoga as a medication, make them part of our life.
My favorite folks, especially my young friends, have received many good news in the past few days in the field of the game.
In many types of sports our sportsmen are encouraging the nation.
In the game of Hawky, India has won the Asian Corps by playing it.
Since our fighters played greatly, we could become the successor of the Asian Corps after the last few years.
Before this, India won the Asian Corps in 2003 and 2007.
Wearing snacks, helpers and folks, and folk skins.
Hawky has got a good share of India in the next battling game too.
Beatminton's star Kitambi has played a very charming role in winning India in the Tenmark Open.
This is the third Super Seris Primir's victory after the Indonesia Open and Australian Opens.
And for our young sportsmen, they're demonstrating my gracious appreciation for the greatest accumulation of India.
Friends, this month FIFA started the World Cupboy competition for 17 years of age.
In the world, the dress came to India, all showed their skills in the calculation field.
I've got a chance to see a cat.
The sportsmans, the visualists were boiling all of them.
The world is taking care of the world's most important event called World Crown.
Thank you for seeing such a big furnace, power, enthusiasm, slavery of all young soldiers.
The World Crown began to be successful, all the dresses showed their skills very specially.
Though India could not be successful, the young sportsmen of India had won the hearts of everyone.
With India, all the world nations have enjoyed this funny duties, fascinating calculators, captured.
The symptoms are visible that the future of the climate is very bright.
I'll once again demonstrate all the sportsmen, those who were helpful, all the sports royalists, life and appreciation.
When my favorite folks, who write to me with the number of pure India, have to assess their feelings, I'm gonna give every day the voice of the mind, and I'm supposed to be dedicated to purifying every mind's voice.
Some people send smoking about the efforts of small brethren, some send information about the efforts of the youth.
In some places there is something newly related to sanitation or somebody gets information about the changes made by an officer's efforts.
In the Chandrapur fort of Maharashtra a remarkable story has been given to me in the past .
There, the government structure named Ecological Protection Organisation has been engaged in cleaning the Chandrapur Fort through its total weight.
The 200-year-old act has been engaged in the work of cleaning the fortress engaged in the team, without restlessness.
Continuous 200 days.
Before and after, they sent smokes to the head already.
If I was imagined to see the smoke, see them in the minds of anyone who would see them, when they were dreadful and unconscious, the dream of satisfaction can be thrilled - such people, ecological protection organisation youths, their sneezes, their hopes, their consciences, their consciences.
Look at this, your disappointment will turn into confidence.
This sympathy of satisfaction, beauty, social activity, interference, etc. is an excellent specimen.
The fort is the symbol of our tradition.
The responsibility of protecting and purifying historical segments is ours.
I'm supposed to appreciate the ecological protection organisation and their skirmishes, and the Sandrapur citizens.
My whole countrymen, on 4th November, we're celebrating Guru Nanak's birthday.
Guru Nanak Dev was not only the first Guru of the Sikhs but also the Guru of the world.
He sat about the welfare of the human community, and he served all the slaves equally.
They pressed women's rights and respect for women.
Guru Nanak Dev is 28,000 .
The mercury carried out.
He spread the message of romantic human nature through his journey.
He interacted with the people, enlightened them the meaning of pregnancy, sacrifice and pregnancy.
He delivered the equation of the community to the state, not only to stop his message with a few words, but also showed his actions.
He runs lunch or social food habitations, through which people started feeling about service in their minds.
When people sit together and eat food then people became foolish in the mind and equality .
Guru Nanak Dev has offered three messages to live in a favorable life - the name of God, the name of life, the lives of life, help those who need.
Guru Nanak Dev describes the sacred script of Guru Granth to tell him about his teachings.
In the year 2019 we celebrate our 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev .
Let's try to move forward on the way to show his advice and news.
My folk folks celebrate their birthday on the 31st October month of October.
We'll know that these are the only ones who set up the basement of the new India.
Through the unparalleled journey of this great Mandan of Bharat Maa we can learn many today .
On the 31st October Indira Gandhi's day she left the world.
The specialty of Sardar Buddhist Pi-Batelle is that he has not only shown the idea of change, to act, to disperse the most difficult problems, to prove his prevalence.
He worked as a favourite.
Sardar Buddha Boy Boatel accepted the responsibility of linking India to the same work.
Initially, millions of folk folks must be brought under the same political structure law.
His ability to decide was to give him the ability to cross all the restrictions.
Wherever the words needed, they used them.
He did it where many programs were required.
When he marked a plane, he was moving forward to that plane with full stress.
They say that everyone's thinking is equal, they can only coordinate the country.
My intention is to make him enjoy ourselves.
And he shouldn't allow royal differences to interfere in us, all the priests in India should make our future on what we love our nation, mutual love and goodness.
CARTAR THE THE THE SHOUGHING IN THE NEWING IN THE IN THE NEWING IN THE IN THE IN THE INDIAS IN THE IN THE THERESTION.
That's why we're following the day of his birth anniversary.
His participant's sympathy in giving a coordinated form to the nation.
On the 31st day of October, before Sardar's birthday, there is a program for communication throughout the country, in which many people are afraid of children , youth , women , all age groups from all over the country.
I'm gonna tell you that you should share this run for unity, simultaneously, together with each other's comfort.
My heart, folks, after Deepavali holidays, with new determination, new tactics, you're all busy again in your daily life.
Your dreams and dreams of all are my wealthy life.
Thank you very much.
