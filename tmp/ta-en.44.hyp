On the 15th day, the Prime Minister's compiled Manki Bath's speech, the voice of the mind, the people of the country, my love for all of you
In the last voice program,
I've been asking you if you have to go to some places for the holiday, if you have to see some magnificent scenes there, then record them incredibly in Andia Hashtag.
When I said so, I don't expect you to get the answers of this quantity from you.
Lacs of people were sent smoking through dudders, fashbooks, instagrams etc.
I can only tell you that they're all not a single one.
How many species of India is full
The Government of India is also not supposed to think about the quantity that you have done through the tourism that you can activate in such a way as symbols , arts , natural forms , waterfalls , mountains and circulars.
I've got some retweet news that attracted my blackness in them.
It is known that some people did not record the smooth pictures of the Bella Caves of Andhra Pradesh that there are such caves for many people of the country.
The surroundings of Orchha of Madhya Pradesh are also similar .
We always know Rajasthan as a low state of water.
But it's very surprising when a man sends smokes about waterfalls from there.
That's actually, there's been a wonderful thing.
We'll take it forward, continue to act.
I'm surprised to see the world.
Our natives will be surprised.
The future community will know about these.
I'm the people of the country
You're making me the Prime Minister of the country.
But within me, man gets away from the external conditions like status, abortion and abortion.
On the 21st day of the month of June International Yoga also made me forget myself like this .
I'm about this day.
Nah.
When I talked to the conference, I thought it was a good thing.
But on the 21st of the month of June, I've seen the sun everywhere.
In the whole world it was awake to say that there is no place to welcome the sun through yoga exercises .
I can tell you that yoga practices don't hide the sun in the world.
What is the quantity of yoga that the world is spreading red pillars , seeing this, which Indians have the pride and glory of the mind
We've even tried to enjoy the flood.
My heart has reached thrill.
The French folks are very charming in the minarets of the Sean river and the Eiffel pillars , they also choose these symbols for the practice of yoga .
The NYERAC people knew Times' salvation for yoga.
While talking about Australia 's Sydney , the scenes of Abera House glitter immediately in the mind .
Australian natives have done yoga practices before the Abera House Church .
It is a matter of pride that the traditional symbols like North America and Silicon valley , Millen city Dumo church were performed in later times .
I'm on the 21st day of June.
Nah.
They're i... public secretary Bun Gee.
Nah.
I had a lot of joy when I saw the yoga exercises in the headquarters .
Likewise, i.
Nah.
Peace-breaking forces also showed Yoga practices.
Even in India, on the white pillar of Siachen, our Ranuva warriors exercised yoga.
Our troops in the ocean showed yoga exercises across the blue seas all over the world.
Delhi.
By doing yoga exercises in large numbers, Kinnas has contributed to the world.
Rajbhad was Yogapat.
I'm supposed to appreciate my psychological thanks to the world and the world.
It doesn't mean that it's going to be a program.
A new lecture, a new feeling, a new interest, a new enthusiasm in all the lamps of the world.
A few days ago a child administered to Manifestation had smoken his family.
It's very funny, it's famous all over the world.
In the course of yoga practice, women, men, elders, boys, villagers, citizens, growing nations, growing nations.
Yoga is actually a factor that connects the world.
I don't know how deliberate, humiliating this present in the world of intelligence.
But I feel a matter of great importance to every Indian that the world is very interested in knowing about India.
There has been an increase in interest in India, the world has a desire to know about the furnaces, traditions, cultures of India.
All of us are the treachery of this great tradition without any stopping the world.
It must be introduced to the world.
But if we have the greatest and pride of our tradition, we can take this particularly to the world.
Sometimes we're supposed to say "what's new in it", for example, we can tell our families.
We don't know the biggest thing about the families of India in the world.
Why don't we talk to the world about our family traditions, furnaces
When the world knows about it, certainly keep your finger on your nose.
In this way many pockets that have left our fronts with gifts are found in our livelihood.
The world has the power on special insights.
Sarvade Yoga also has a responsibility with the happiness and pleasure of the day.
It's our duty to give the world the most important yogic scientists.
It is our responsibility to keep all the traditions of yoga visible in the world on the same platform .
It's the job of keeping the youths of the country, especially in the information technology sector, that's why you're all involved in planning online yoga programs.
Get information about yoga related structures, introductions about yoga graduates
Get information related to yoga
If you want to play yoga then you will have to prepare a correspondence of the type where you will get .
I believe it can be done with you.
Come on, in some order, someone can start
There's also a new power.
I've been seeing the possibilities of the past few days.
The government is settling
uickly working government
We've been able to see how the target's gonna finish the job after arguing that one.
We shouldn't forget that we were inconvenienced and complicated.
A year ago, in the directions of the drain, the feeling of "nothing happens, no matter what happens" was reflecting.
Do you know there's a province called Ayush in the prince
Nobody's attention will be back to it.
Two, four times in five years, a small area in a corner.
But during the day of yoga it was the head.
The smallest area of this area has been the largest reception in the world.
When the target is ahead of us, it's an example of how many small structures can be fulfilled.
The world was surprised to see how our people survived the affected people in a human country.
In a few hours only the world has climbed to see that Indians had roamed the help of Nepal .
It's the government to assist.
As the bank account was being started under the people's funding plan, all the bank employees dumped the bullying, in a few days, millions of people joined the bank.
On the 15th August last month, I had left room rooms to settle bricks in school.
I was asking you to do this work within the next 15th month of August.
Whatever work has not been completed for 60 years, it's the only way to end it.
Only 4 1 lakh toilets should be made.
But today, on the 15th of the month of August, it is a matter of great importance that the school dwelling in the schools is almost complete.
I mean, everyone's beneficial, pleasure, like government, public, government officials, everyone wants to dedicate themselves to the country's work in an uncontrollable manner.
If we begin to function strongly in the mind, the government will work fast, the government workers will work fast, and the command will be celebrated by lifting the head.
It's my own experience.
It's the real power to advance the meeting.
Last month, three people from Kolkata had announced co-operative plans.
In the shortest time, very creatively favoured.
There are no more plans in India as well as the protection of the people.
But through these three plans, we're busy in a big way in the social welfare sector.
In such a short period more than ten crore people have been engaged in some ways in the immunization plans .
But we have to move it further.
There's an idea in my mind, I want to put it in front of you.
Raksha Bandhan is coming in the month of August, the people of the country will all start a massive campaign before the Raksha Bandhan festival
My mothers and sisters of our country, these people can benefit from the copies
In ourselves, women who finish food, wash household utensils, sisters, and sisters who worked outside the forest, maybe sisters of our family.
We're worth 12 rupees or 330 rupees before the holy Raksha Bandhan bandage, they're not gonna examine the people's life-long copies policy.
It can be the best test of a brother giving his sister before the Raksha Bandan festival.
Why don't we work as a sacred day called Raksha Bandan, which is 2 crores, 4 crores, 6 crores, 10 crores all over the country
Come on, everyone joins me, try to fulfil this sword.
When I sound the hole of the mind, many people give me advice.
This way, many people have advised me to tell me something about the rain.
You must speak in the mind about the climate of Tripura, Yogesh Tandekar of Nagpur, Harshvarthan of Mysore, Braveen dynasty, Divyanshu Gupta.
They've given good thoughts to their share.
Ordinarily the season of monsoon is a pleasant season for the mind .
It's the first rain that attracts the mind of all the old people.
You can also enjoy drinking in this rainy season with hot pakora , bajji , sola , flying tea .
As the sun's rays give us life, the rain also gives us strength.
Every drop of rain is valuable.
In the same way as a dweller, in the same way as community, we have to enhance the feeling of protecting every drop of water.
The water in the village should be in the same village as the water in the city should be used for use.
That's what we should be sure
We're very busy trying to save rain water.
If rain water is flooded, it will turn into water, the water of the moon will finish our water requirement throughout the year.
Nothing new principle is rain water squaring.
It's the one that has been consistently followed for many years.
The vaccines, the water supply, the small ponds, the lakes, we must protect every drop of water.
If you have to go to the warfare of the birth place of the Gandhians , you can see their absence, you can see a 200 year old water conserved inside his house in which there is facility of direct rain water .
It must be seen to you.
Even after 200 years, it's still working.
Water doesn't go bad enough for the whole year.
Seaboard city, Porbandar.
But through the consumption of rainy season sweet water is available .
Even in that time, this amount has been supplied.
We can't do this too
It must be a people's movement.
The village should be followed this way.
Like this, greenery takes our eyes.
How beautiful is the green life
Woods and plants, gardens, parks, all of them change their lives together with greenery, right
We all have to carry out trees during this rainy season through social organisations, by the youth.
I'm giving a suggestion from my own experience, this grammatic technology is very successful.
When you wax, put an old soil near the plant, fill the water in it.
One-and-a-half times the tree will grow faster than you fill the water in it.
You're gonna do it
There's nothing to do with the old soil.
Instead of building a hull in your wilderness, shrink trees.
I'll tell my farmer friends that it'll change your vacation.
Even though rain is very pleasant, enjoyable, it is possible to spread a lot of diseases during the rainy season.
In the absence of time of treatment the patients with the doctors will become dry .
During rainy season diseases spread through water are found more .
Due to moisture filled in the environment , microbes develop balgibs so that health is one of the most important .
Cleanliness is very important.
It is important to drink pure water .
Most people swallow water in this season .
It's nice.
The quantity we're supposed to be protected from diseases.
Need water, rain, but it's important to be safe from the moment.
Folks, we're already introducing three new plans, especially for the people of the city.
There are only 500 cities in our country, small and big.
Waste to wealth - can get out of the skull.
We can pour diamonds, build rocks, generate electricity, clean the polluted water, we can use this operation in the outskirts.
According to the Amrith Project, we're planning to live our cities for the betterment.
Likewise, we have to be our country with the world level.
In such a way, the Smart Citizens in the country, the Smart Cities.
On the other hand, there must be a house to live in the country too deep.
That house must be water, electricity, toilet etc.
Schooling facilities should be available for children in the nearby areas.
In 2022, when India celebrates 75th year of independence, the Indians should be given homes to all.
Bringing these three things back, we're starting a big plan.
I'm sorry that there's a big change in urban life, and I hope these plans are going on.
I'm also in touch with you through social museums, very new ideas that I have the colors that came from you, and I'm getting good data deficiencies about government activities.
In some cases, the suggestions of the persons living in remote areas are touching the mind.
One of the government's health is to keep women safe, studying.
But when the government's plan is adopted by a person, society or village, its power becomes immense.
In the past, Jakalan, the leader of the Beepipur village of Haryana state, was engaged in a very comfortable end.
He made a competition in his village in the name of Selfie with Daughter.
It's all fathers, in the middle, gave a selfie surveillance with their daughters, to record in social networks.
I loved this imagination.
There's also a reason for this.
In Haryana, compared to males, the rate of female children is very low.
There are 100 districts of this kind of worrying rate in the country .
It's too much in Haryana.
But when the leader of a small village of this Haryana state makes women a quiet end to protecting children, it gives a unique joy to the mind, gives a new hope.
Even if it pleases me on one side, this possibility makes me even a prediction.
That's why I'm putting a coin in front of you... you're also like Selfie with Daughter... and book your daughter together in the Hashtag Selfie with Daughter.
Also, protect women, keep reading, send you a tag line, write special symptoms, write - English, Hindi or your mother language in any language, if you're sending the tag line, it's chosen, you and your daughter will retweet the selfie humor.
Somehow we're gonna make a plan to save the child, keep reading.
Brother Sunn, we're going to join this work in the Haryana State Beeppur Grah.
I'm asking you that you must record in Hashtag Selfie with Daughter.
Watch your daughters, glory, enjoy the enjoyment of women's children.
We're gonna have to shut down the clothing on us.
My wealth lives for all of you in this season
Remember the rainy season
Change our conquests green
Don't accept international yoga day as a day's disappearance, do yoga exercises everyday, of course you will be able to do good.
I'm calling it experienced.
Go ahead of it.
Change yoga practices as part of your life.
Likewise send your records to me about incredible india.
How many species in our country can be known to all the countries of the world
But it appears that the records of handicrafts have come very little.
Please send me the records of handicrafts in your area to the incredible world.
Elementary things can be made in your city, harvests may be involved in it, who has the capacity, they can make it, and you'll record it
The world's nose has to be covered with the specialties of India.
We have one of the simple ways for this.
Of course we can get it.
I'm the people of the country
Today it sounds in my mind's hole.
I'm talking to you next time for the next voice program.
Some believe that I'm gonna know about the government's health plans in my voice program.
But I didn't believe that.
I'd like to talk to you about these plans in many other places, in the voice program of the mind.
This is what enjoys me.
Thank you very much
.
