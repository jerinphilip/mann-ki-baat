The voice of the mind, August 2018, folks
Fucking
Today Rakshabandhan is celebrated throughout the country .
My lives ahead of this sacred day for all the folk.
Rakshabandan is located in front of his brother-in-law, love and faith.
This festival has been a great example of social welfare for centuries.
Several special stories associated with the reliability of two different parts or people of time are filled with the history of the country .
Jenmastamy's coming for a few days.
In the whole of the environment , elephants , horses , teeth - Jai Kanhaiya , govinda-Kovinda , etc . are singing .
The joy of enjoyment in Sri Krishna's devotion is immense.
In many parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra, our youths have been making arrangements for the production of Tahi-Handi.
My heart is full of life for folks, Rakshabandan, Janmashtami.
He's the Prime Minister, sir.
I'm studying the tenth class in the Vijaya Barti Village of Chinmai, Bangalore.
Today's sacred day.
Everyone says the language is very easier.
You can talk to us in a synthetic language.
That's why you're gonna tell your superior blackness about the specialty of the language of Sanskrit.
I'm sorry.
Synmie
You read the letter written in the samskrit.
Very special, very special
My lives to you.
I'm supposed to demonstrate my whole life to all the folks, hunting on the week of Samskrit.
Thanks to you my mind, sister Synmie for a special thing.
Besides friends, Rakshabandh, we celebrate the day of Siravana Purnami.
This great pocket is more special, I'm trying to see all my lives who are dedicated to you to bringing you into the common people.
There's a significance for every language.
The most inexpensive language of Tamil language in the world is rich in India .
In the same way, the beginning of the Vedic period, so far, the language of the Sanskrit has also developed the biggest participant of knowledge.
Knowledge connected in every field of life , Kalanjiyam , Samskrit language and its literature are engraved .
It's scientific, technical, technological, cultivation, healthy life, astronomy, artistic, geographical, serving, economic or environment.
.
It is said that the symptoms of the world's warmth have been expanded in our obsessions.
You will be happy to all that the village dwellers of Madur of Shimoga district of Karnataka use the language of the language even today .
You'll be surprised to know that the language of the rare possibilities of creating many new words is a sympathetic language.
Thousand words, 200 before mixtures, prefix, 22 surveillances, suffix and societies are possibilities to create ideal words.
That is why any hot feeling or thing can be described comfortably .
There is a lot of importance in the Sanskrit language.
Even today, we're using our conversations and emotional English policies.
Sometimes you use poems in scriptures, but they know who knows the synthesis, can describe a lot of things through less words in the synthesis.
And social language is very easy to understand because of our being connected to our own culture with our soil.
For example, know about the importance of the guru in life... that if any teacher gives a single leaf to his chest, thanks that he does not have any joy in search of the whole world for the guru.
The teacher who comes to us will recite this feeling to us before the day.
Knowledge and guru, irresponsible, impossible, lack of value.
Besides your mother, only teachers who are responsible for taking the thoughts of the children in the right direction, we can see the biggest impact they make all our lives.
Teacher's day-to-day career, the former President of the country, Dr.
Sarvaballa, Radhakrishna, we always remember them.
His birthday is the day we celebrate teachers all over the country.
I'm demonstrating my life before the teachers coming to all the teachers of the country.
Well, I'm telling my lives to science, education, students, teachers' feelings.
My folks
Our hard work has brought this seasonal neglect to our farmers.
In the slightest heat , the vegetation , the dry waterfalls etc . are drenched , but sometimes the most rainy season produces the humidity of the flood .
In some places more rainy conditions are natural than other places .
We've seen how bad the life of the people was suffering from the horrific floods of Kerala.
Today in this difficult situation the country stands in favor of Kerala .
We can understand the agony of the families of those who lost their clothes, those who were terrible.
Though their grief cannot be fully attracted to us, I'm supposed to be given to the families dreaded in a thrill, 125 crores of Indians are standing with your skin in this gap of sorrow.
I'm sorry that those who are injured in this natural campus should be quickly relieved.
I am fully convinced that the state's population, the surprising surroundings and surpassing Kerala.
We can see the vision of mankind spreading in the middle of the middle of the city even if the destruction of the destruction of the dragons has come.
From the party to Kamrupam , from Kashmir to Kanyakumari everybody gathers something with their status , pieces .
It is a part of Kerala, a district of India, a part of it, reinforces the life specific status of people.
All the elders, the people involved in all the fields are giving their share.
How to reduce the seats of the people of Kerala, everybody decides how to share their grief.
Well, we know that the military soldiers lived in Kerala as the goddess of the Meetpub work.
They haven't left any effort to save the Sikh people in the flood.
Everyone has given a big part in this act of air force, trumpets, landlords, border security forces, central factory security forces, expeditions.
Especially at this time I'd like to describe the hard work of the National Factory Reservation Agency NDRF.
They're very special in confluence.
The ability of this army is the center of a new illusion for every Indian.
Normally, the festival was celebrated, especially for the country, to power Kerala, they should be quickly exposed by the impact of this hotel, and we would like to make the development journey of Kerala very fast.
Once again, from all the folk levels of the country, the people of Kerala, the people of Nadeng and the neighbors believe that the whole country is at your side of this confluence, it's helpful.
I love folks
This time I was watching the suggestions that came for the horse of the mind.
I could see that the folk had written more about what matters , that is , the favourite Atal Bihari Vajpayee of ours .
Kirti of Kaziabad, Swadhi Vats of Sonib, brother of Kerala, Praveen of West Bengal.
MyGov has also been asking for the Norendra Mobile App that I should speak about the confrontation of Alexander Adal's life.
On the 16th day of August, the nation and the world were drowned in sorrow by listening to the news of the time.
14 years ago, he opened the Prime Minister's position.
In a way, for the last decade, he had been away from a strong kingdom.
He didn't get a place in the news, he lived away from public life.
Even though the Buddhist period is the biggest difference, after the 16th day of August, the nation and the world have not seen any difference in this decade of time in the minds of the common Indians.
Dead love, sickness, unhappiness for them has been enhanced in the country, which shows their huge personality.
For the past few days the most important achievements of Dal have been revealed before the country .
People remind him of the most excellent executive bureaucracy, well-known bachelor, the Prime Minister of the people's mind, memory.
Good significance is that the country's only thanks to them for bringing Governance to the first waterfall.
But I'd like to tell Dal about his widespread family and a contempt, I'd like to show it.
Atal, he tried to change the political culture he gave to India, which would be very beneficial in the days to come to India due to its creative leadership.
This is sure.
India was also thankful for the 91th political dynasty conducted in 2003.
Because of this change there were two important changes in the Indian kingdom .
Initially, the number of state rulers should be only 15 percent in the number of total legislative members.
Secondly, according to the opposite legislation of the party, the quantity of one third of the former members increased, making two of the third members.
Besides, clear procedures have been made to ensure the membership of the members of the party.
For the past decades, the political culture that established large scale ministries in India has come to an end, these big ministers have not been subjected to the tasks of political leaders.
Atal they changed this position.
The money, expenses, etc. were collected due to his activity.
And there was progress in strength.
It's possible only in a sympathy like dragons, our political culture has begun to work healthy traditions.
Atal, they're a real patriot.
During his retirement, the change was made during the dedication of the Report of Report.
In the last five o'clock in the evening, according to the rules of the British, the financial report was submitted.
In 2001, Atal had made the time of dedication of financial reports from 5 o'clock to 11 o'clock in the morning.
This was found in the reign of ' Adal ' , which is the law of the Indian Flag .
It was denied in 2002.
According to several methods made by this, it is possible to fly the silver flag in general.
Through this unemployed Indians got the opportunity to lay down the national flag .
With this we could take our animals and silver plates away from the luxurious people.
You've seen the basic changes in the country's legislatures, and people's representatives, in which they've fooled the basic changes, didn't you
Like this, today you are watching the issues related to the conduct of the state governments and the state governments in the same way.
We can also see the presence of obstacles against this idea and support.
It's a good thing, it's a clear symptom for public opinion.
A healthy, special public representative system is the most important sympathizer of them, to mislead good traditions, to make people's vision system more effort and to push up, to open arguments, etc.
In this case, we promise to wear his dream of a very, prosperous India, I dedicate him to our syrups and syrups.
My little folks
In the speech of the court, they are spoken about folding, collision, jealousy.
But if it's a good thing, it won't talk too much.
A few days ago, the rainy season of the administration was over.
You're enjoyed knowing that the creativity of the States was 1,18 percent and 74 percent.
All the members of the party have made the rainy season more useful for the party's difference.
As a result, 21 Masodhaks and 14 Masodhaks were completed in the seminar.
This rainy season of both of them will be worth remembering for social justice and youth welfare.
In this group segment many monks were fulfilled for the youth and the reproductive classes.
It's been for ten years that the poor people and the tribes should be succumbed to the murder of others.
In order to determine the rights of the reproduced classes, the country has fulfilled the determination of the manufacturing of the other reproductives, which has been enacted by the capital.
This predecessor stands for the purpose of social justice.
The Shedult classes, the Masotha was also finished to protect the rights of Shedult tribes.
This law will further protect the welfare of tribal societies.
And, to prevent the misdeeds of the guilty, the faith in the minds of the lowest.
Any civil society cannot afford the injustice against women's strength.
It's not ready to mix the patrons who are engaged in breastfeeding.
That's why, the court has finished the jurisdiction of the criminal law and made a strong conviction.
The criminals who were involved in the massacre were sentenced to at least 10 years.
The women aged 12 years have been allowed to sleep for children who are breastfeeding .
A court in Mandsore of Madhya Pradesh, in two months, you may have read a few days before the two offenders, who have been convicted of slaughtering the slaughter of the child, were convicted.
Prior to this, a court in Katney of Madhya Pradesh ended the investigation in just five days and sentenced the offenders to sleep.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have been granting orders in such cases.
This law is the responsibility of preventing the crimes committed against women and children.
Socially unchanged economic growth is not complete.
Muthalak Masodha was full in the native.
But in the territory of the States it was unable to complete it.
I want Muslim women to believe that the whole country stands in full mind to get them justice.
We can make changes in the lives of people, evils, reproductives, gentlemen, destitute people while we're ahead of the folk world.
This time in the rainy season square square has made a special premise connected with everyone .
I'm supposed to demonstrate all the members of the country with my heart.
My folks
In today's days, the attention of many crores of folk people comes from the Asian sports competitions going on in Jerta.
Every day people are in newspapers, TVs, messages, social networks, which Indian warriors have won the tragedy.
Asian sports competitions are now going on.
I'd like to show my appreciation to all the sportsmen who won for the country.
I'm telling the sportsmans who share the match with me.
India's sportsmen, specially gunfighters, competitors, etc. have performed very important achievements.
But before our activity, our sportsmen are confused with such unpredictable areas as Wushu competitions, boating competitions.
These aren't very confused - proofs of hope and dreams of Indian sports and sportsmen...
It's a very creative symptom.
At any rate, our young men who are 15-16 years of age will end up with the complicated young sportsmen.
This is also a very good symptom.
Most of them are living in small villages, who have achieved this success by their hard work.
On the 29th day of August we celebrate the 'Today Sports Day ' .
In this case, I'm supposed to define my life to all the sportsmen.
Also, the great sportsman in Hawky, who is considered to be a priest, Diyan Chand, dedicates my shirts to them.
You all play, I'm supposed to call upon all the folks to blacken your sex.
Because healthy India helps to absorb complete India.
Only if India is sure, its future can be bright.
I'm determining our wishes for the special activity of other sportsmen, with the appreciation of our successors winning the Asian Sports Federies.
Everybody's national sports are my strong life before the day.
He's the Prime Minister
I'm talking about a research student from Kambur to Poona Tribadi.
He's the Prime Minister, you're talking to a student who goes to college in the last shit, before that you're talking to the doctors, patch calculators.
On the day of the 15th day of September, when the writers coming to us, you speak in the study of ourselves, our happiness will increase, and we will be very happy, and we will get our hearts enjoyed for the country in the days to come, thank you. They're all, I'm forgetting your feelings.
We're watching building houses, buildings with bricks.
But just 1200 years ago, can you imagine that a large mountain, a different rocky mid mountain, is a very special, expansive, magnificent temple
It is imagined to be imagined, but it has happened that this temple is also Kailashnath Temple located in Ellora of Maharashtra.
If anybody tells you that a stupa with a 80-weight black slum was finished up to 60 meters before just 1000 years, you wouldn't believe it, huh
But in Tamilnadu in Dhanjavur there is an unbelievable composition of architecture , research etc . in Pragdheshwar temple .
Rani Kyev, the 11th century in Gujarat's Patan...
.
Everyone seeing it will be surprised.
India has come from Earth's research studies.
Several writers have appeared in India, who have slaughtered the imagination of imagination, have given the illustrations of the science world known as miracles.
There is a gem that we got in this tradition of great writers Bharat Ratna Dr . M .
They're Viswaeshwaria.
Precious activity is still deepening people's amazing.
Lacs of farmers and civilians are benefitted even today by the Krishnaraja Sagar Dam built in the jungle river .
In these parts of the country they come to be worshipped , the country also gives respect to it .
In the memory of the former, on the 15th day of September, we will come daily to the writers.
Our country's technicians have emerged in a different summary all over the world.
If we talk about the miracles of the world of research, in 2001, a decade of a terrible earthquake occurred in the Ghatch region of Gujarat.
Then when I was leaving there as a self-sufficient throat, I got a chance to go to a village.
That place was 100 years old to meet a corner.
He was calling me, calling my house to park it in the bar-cutch area.
He further said, this house has seen three landmarks.
We've met three landmarks.
I've realized them in this house.
But never seem to be harmful.
This house is designed for our fronts, natural, environment here.
He was demonstrating this thing in the center of the great humidity.
Many centuries ago, how many buildings were built in accordance with those agents, local environments, so that how civilians could live safely, then my mind was born.
We're gonna have to think for the future, if we follow the writers' day.
What new things can be learned for the changing times
Can you imagine
Can you make a joint
That's gonna be dressed, where the training boards are to be run.
Today the bus termination has become the biggest work.
The world is suffering from natural bedrooms.
In such a situation, how should the new form of artificial library be, what can be the stairs of it, what students can imagine, how to be the artillery of the environment, how to advance the privilege through the valuation of the materials found in the inside, how to make the unconstitutional condition, we have to see the teachers sympathize everyday.
My mind is a lot of people
The climate of the festivals comes, the products of Deepavali were started.
Become to meet us in the hoove of the mind, let's talk openly, move forward to the country through our minds, be free.
With this feeling, my many lives for all of you.
Thank you.
We're meeting again.
