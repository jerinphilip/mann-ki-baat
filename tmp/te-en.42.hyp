Man Ki Bath, August 2015 is my favorite patriot.
All of you are greetings.
Another time I got the chance to come between you to tell me the words.
People in the remote south are drowned in ancient affairs.
The sacred Raksha Bandhan festival celebrated throughout the country.
The Government of India has introduced several new paths for social security of the common people.
I'm glad to listen to all the philosophy at a very short time.
I've heard a little bit of yours to give this Bhadrata story to Man Man and Akkaches on the Rakshabandhan Pilgrim.
Since the beginning of this story, 11 crore families have reached this story.
Almost half the procedure came to me to the mothers, to the skulls.
I think it's a clean signal.
Pavitra Rakshabandan Pilgrimage is telling the maternal matrimonies, to the accelerators of many purifications.
Today, I'm talking to you, that's what the President Jan Dhan Yojana is doing.
Does 60 finish such a little bit of a finished paddy
There's a lot of gestures that have grown.
But, I'm happy today.
- All the principals, all the branches of the bank, are united, sufficient.
Now I've opened the bank accounts of around 17 crores 45 lakhs for my funeral.
Gero balancs have to open the empty-- but, by paying the poor procedures, accumulated 22 thousand crores of rupees.
There is also a banking part in the development of economic business.
This business has reached the house of the poor.
And that's why the bank's friends were also bullshit.
Today lakhs of more than 25 thousand bank friends are playing across the country.
The young man also got the symptoms.
BANKING BANKING ROAGING, Economy, Deads.
You're all happy to know that Laksha set up 31 thousand camps to ignore the economic obsession to discover him.
Don't stop opening the remainders.
Now many thousands of people have lost their way to get the overdraft under Jan Dhan Yojana.
Even got them.
The ducks from the bank were slaughtered.
I appreciate the weekend related to this.
Leave the links with the bank - the bank's cleared weekends, the fugitive Sodra Sodrimans.
These banks don't leave them now, you.
I've brought them to your grave, now you're your intention to buy them.
The bank must remain alive.
You're grateful to me who buys you.
The meetings of the Christians of Gujarat, the violent conflicts of the country have been disturbed.
Gandhiji, in the area of Saddar Patell, if anything happens, troubles the whole of the unexpected country.
But in a bit of time, my elders of Gujarat, my son-in-law, all the citizens have crossed the border.
In order to stop the situation.
He played the role of kilak.
Gujrat is pleased with peace on the other day.
Peace, unity, sophistication, this is the true path.
Move the shoulders of the shoulders of the shoulders in the development direction.
Evolution is the only communication.
I got the chance to get rid of the Italian Sufi comrades.
They got the chance to hear their words.
To tell the truth, their feelings, the chances of listening to their words seemed like listening to some music.
Their words, the way they speak, the generosity of the Sufi empire, the beauty of it, which is hidden in O music.
I've realized all these things when they're in their mind.
Thank you very much for me.
The true nature of the Islamic religion seems to be so surprising that the whole of the world is aware of it.
The love affair in the Sufi empire, the generosity in which there is me to send this message to the far-reaching areas.
Manishi, who promoted the species, also praises the Islamic religion.
I'm telling these people too.
There is a need to understand the Sufi composition when the man sings any soul.
I'm quickly sure I'll get a chance.
I'm so lucky to call this invitation.
Buddhist scholars from many countries of the province come to Buddha in Bharath.
The world overwhelming Manav tribe is synonymous with all the facts.
I was invited to participate in it.
They're so happy to invite me when Bodhgaya comes.
Pandit Nehru went to Buddha.
Buddhagaya gets a chance to go with the scholars around the world.
I'm so enjoying.
My favorite farmer Soddar Sodrimnalara.
I'm supposed to tell you my mind this day again.
That's all I've been referring to this thing in the work of Manki Bath.
You're listening, I'm listening when I talk to the parlment, I'm still hungry when I talk to Bahiranga.
Man Ki Bath is also listening to the activity.
I'm always saying okay.
The dispute that is settled on the ground of Bhusekran is in the frequency of the Lord.
I'm ready to accept anything for the welfare of the farmers.
I'm telling you this thing I'm sneaking.
It's a matter of fact that the state's princes have to tell my dealer Sodrimans about the matter of survival in the landscape.
It's like a miracle.
The rural areas, the poor farmers, the drains of the fields, the drainage of the drains, the pillars of the village, the pillars of the electric sarfra, the construction of the house for the rural district, the composition of the rural district, and the opportunity for the benefit of the youth of the palato, to find the earth from the junction of the instruments of the power of the plants, the survivors felt to beautify.
But, I saw a lot of stuff spread.
The peasants are intimidated by fear.
Crazy Sodra Sodrimnala.
Don't you believe the words.
Don't panic in the rotten neighborhood.
Fear of the farmers, nobody can give the chances of snatching the horrors.
I have a great deal of Prati Vani in this country.
But, the farmer's wife has so much importance.
We've issued an ardenance on the Bhusekron.
This Arden's becomes a period of tomorrow August 31.
I fixed the fucking furwa after it's time.
It means that the neighbourhoods ahead of my Lordship have become reproductive.
But there was a depth in it.
That's what - 13 points are - they need to be completed in the surroundings.
That's why Arden's brought.
But, even after these arguments, it's too tired.
The Ardenen's just finished.
But if anybody benefits the farmers directly, that's why the farmers have a straightforward economic outcome, we're taking 13 points as per the restrictions, Eroze's suppressing them.
Because farmers don't want to be ruined, we're finishing 13 pints without the landscape that's so far for the purpose of not hurting economic projects.
"Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan" is not a novel.
It's our mantra.
My farmer is giving homicide to Sodra Sodrimans.
The villages, the welfare of poor farmers.
So, on August 15, I said, "Kaval is not a business branch, but it's a business, a farmer's welfare department, we take this decision forward very fast."
My farmer is sodreamer.
Now you don't have to grab words.
You didn't do anybody trying to bury fears.
You don't have to hate fears.
I have to tell you the matter of Moro.
Two days ago, 1965 finished 50 swords.
When I came to the war of 1965, it was normal to come to the memory of Lal Bahadur Shastri.
The memories of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' are also memorable.
It's very comfortable to smell the peacocks that have stabbed its Gaurav representatives.
I'm telling hundreds of weeks about the 65-year war vision.
I'm greeting the wolves.
Such incidents are always inspired by the inspiration.
Last week, I got the chance to get rid of those who belonged to the Sufi empire.
I got the chance to talk to the famous scientists of the country for an hour.
Their words were made to hear.
The science science industry has enjoyed knowing the fact that it is involved in many excellent activities in many countries.
Man scientists are actually doing excellent things.
How do you want to bring their survivors to the civilians in the field
How to change science formulas in the form of architecture
How to connect the Paryogshala to the area
It's a chance to take it forward.
I know too many new things.
They give me a lot of smile.
I'm sorry, too.
And I saw many young scientists.
How dare you talk.
Whatever dreams they've seen in their eyes, in the minds of the story, I said, "Students need to drive up before science, so much hopeful, so many skepticals are the key to this equation.
I didn't tell her again.
My young friend, look at the science of knowledge.
Human educational institutions should also encourage students.
Let's call mykenno letters from the public.
Mr. Perimal Shaw-May from Thane.
Gave.
These were about the educational institutions.
Tell me about skill development.
From the Chidambaram of Tamil Nadu, Sriman Prakash Tripathy wrote about good teachers at the premier education level.
In Vidyarangam, I'm talking about Sanskran.
Especially tell my young friends a word.
- I told you about the Red Fort on August 15.
Why are the low-level employees at home
If you get a sword for my interview, you're gonna get a syphoon to the poor family, the worst woman
Does it work with any help
Are you supposed to beat it
You don't know what steps are playing.
Everyone's running.
It can also be the reason of ironity in the lower level.
I said August 15.
I'd like to be free of one level of low jobs from this interviolence.
- It's 15 days now.
In such a short time, the Lord is very funny to tell the very fast moving forward.
Orders are going.
The decision to free the small jobs from the homewives is almost absurd now.
For the refugees, the poor people don't have to run.
They're not gonna be a victim of the bat.
Don't be white.
The guests of all the countries of this world came to weight.
In order to talk about health, mainly to take the rate of the infant minerals, the 24 countries of the work of 'Call T' axon' were embarrassed under the work process.
This is the first time in another country of America's emergence.
Now about 50 thousand pregnant women in the country of Man, 13 lakhs of children are roaming at the time of birth or delivery.
It's terrible, terrible.
There's been a lot of change in this situation.
At the end of the state, there is a lot of hope for wealth.
Yet this isn't the number.
Let's get rid of the polio, mother, the tetanus in the matter of the child's mortality, and get rid of them.
The propaganda also recognized it.
But now there's a need to protect the girbins.
Man has to protect the newborn babies.
Sodra Sodrimnalara.
There are reports about this Meddy Dengue.
Dengue is really a fascinating disease.
But it's very easy to get rid of it.
It's straightforward to say what I say about clean weight.
Let's see the Man Practice in TV.
But, the mind doesn't look at it.
The news will be published in the trick.
But, man, take them off.
There are ways to keep clean, clean business in small things in the house.
There are widespread spells of action on this poison.
But the mind's not gonna go over them.
And sometimes it seems.
I think we're in a very good house, I'm so clean.
But skinny skinny water must be accumulated.
I'm inviting Dengue to meet you. - Your beautiful love is the same.
Don't make it so easy to kill your mother.
Life is so important.
Don't keep an eye on the deal, it's not the fact that it's the cause of death.
Dengue determination observation is available freely in 514 centers across the country.
It's a matter of observation.
There's so much of your beautiful adventure in it.
For purity, give a lot of honor to cleanness.
Now from Raksha Bandhan to Deepavali, the festivals of the country of Mana are celebrated .
Why don't you drown Man Prati Festival with cleverness
You see-- the clean mind will change in nature.
My favorite countryman.
You have to hear a clean day.
I always say.
Now Man has got the beauty of forgetting the country, but he found only the portion of living for the country.
The two young men of the country of the country - their daughters - they are also from Nasik in Maharashtra.
Doctor Hitendra Mahajan, Doctor Mahendra Mahajan.
But the feeling of serving the Girzans in their hearts is bullshit.
These guys have enhanced the country's coward.
A race called Race Across America is going on in America.
It's terrible.
It's a cycle race that buys about 4 thousand 800 kilometres.
In this cycle race this weekend has been obtained.
He raised the weight.
I'm telling you the harmful purification of this deal.
I appreciate so much.
But, the most pleasant thing about me is that they're funny about doing anything for the tribals.
Look, everybody's trying to make the country move forward.
Sometimes because of the inconvenience of the pride, the man denies the young man.
It's always feeling old.
I don't know anything about the new one.
I guess this shit's been in the centuries.
My experience is different from the young man.
Sometimes you talk to young people - they get a chance to learn a lot.
I saw a lot of young men like that.
They're saying "Sundey on Cycle" is supposed to be a whip.
Some say you're singing a bike day a week.
It's good for our health.
It's good for the tournament.
I'm so enjoyed by the young man.
Even in the country of this mind, there are silks in many numbers.
The cycles are in large numbers.
It's a good effort to protect the environment, for health care.
Now when the two young men from my country wake up in America - I'm enjoyed to appreciate it in the direction of the heavy youngsters.
I'm always appreciating the kingdom of Maharashtra this day.
I'm feeling very happy.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
The Hindu Mill's place in Mumbai is a memorial.
Many times this business is in Pending.
The new governor of Maharashtra has fulfilled this plan.
On the other hand, Babasaheb makes a memorial of magnificent, magnificent, swift.
And the inspiration that drives for complicated, afflicted, frightened, hungry.
Along with that, where the doctor Babasaheb Ambedkar is located in London.
10, King Henry Road.
Some Indians traveling around the world now go to London, Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Memorial.
It's going to be built on the border of Maharashtra.
And it turns into a message to inspire.
I appreciate, I'm glad these two tricks of the Maharashtra embracing Babasaheb Ambedkar.
My dear Sodra Sodrimnalara.
Don't let me know your opinions before Man Ki Bath, coming back.
Because I'm supposed to be supposed to be a part of democracy.
The jungle's part ends with conscience.
The country can move forward only when the shoulders are shaken.
You're all clean.
Thank you.
.
