They demonstrate this very few days . Hannah , who showed him a plate form for Afghanistan . The team of our friends , who wrote me on the toy of Afghanistan , will remind me of it very specially .
The Indian team first called the team of Afghanistan , and the teams called the team of Afghanistan , the photographs in the sports , the Sportsman , the Sportsman . From this one incident we can realize that the game is a joke and the honour of our youths in which there is a better way to find it. My compassion to both the teams of India and Afghanistan . I hope that we will play with the entire spectrum of space with each other in the same way we will also play, open.
I have been told that the demonstration of all the asanas would have been done . On 21 June , on the fourth , there was a very different view . The eyesight came all over . Many people who were taking the gumac on the part of the Japanese team , are the coordination of the United States , the European Union . If they were all in the world enjoying a lot , they would have been told that the people would have demonstration of the country .

Anger is need to defer you, orgies is a great firefight.
He said: "Don't ask the truth, ask him. He's a saint his cast for cred.

My beloved we're nations
It is very long, very deep , very deep , enormous , surgeoned . And history is the whole 100 years of its horrific event in the garden of Punjab .

I do not want to enjoy myself . . . . . . . . . . . .
I always feel that if we look at our surroundings , it is good . If we look at something or the other , we are good . How to do the technicians , brothers , brothers , whom we can do the fields and fields with the fields , and the i . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
TSG is going to be a complete year . The dream of the people of the country , one , nation , nation , is changed today . In fact , if I have a better example of fertility and consciousness of the tax department , then the citizen of the country .
