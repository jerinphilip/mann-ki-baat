My favorite patriots, Namskar, the Bengal Translation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Man Ki Waat' (4th Festival) program
During the sacred festival of Deepavali, you must have spent a holiday very well.
You must have got a chance to travel somewhere.
With new zeal, business and rosary will start.
On the other hand, the preparation for Christmas must have begun.
Festival has a different significance in the life of society.
Sometimes the festival works to remove mourning, sometimes or sometimes it creates a new zeal.
But sometimes when a confusion appears at the time of the festival, it becomes very painful.
The news of natural misery has come from everywhere in the world.
There are reports of natural misery that never heard or thought.
The effect of the change of weather has grown in a drastic pace, we can feel now.
The excessive rain or early rains or long-term rains in our country, especially in Tamil Nadu, has been affected by other states, it has been very deadly.
I am grieving and sympathetic to all these families during these disasters.
The state government uses all the powers in rescue and treasure.
The Central Government also works with shoulders all the time.
Probably a team rescued by the Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu.
Believe me, in spite of this danger, Tamil Nadu will move faster.
He will follow his role to take the country forward.
When all these dangers are happening, the need to resist it is also increasing.
From today onwards, the natural mischief was only on agriculture.
Because, then the natural misfortune or the impact of the day was limited to agriculture.
Now it's changed.
In each case, their capacity buildings, that is, the generosity has become essential.
The government, the learned society, the public, and all the small organisations, have to work in a very scientific way of Capacity building.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I spoke to Pakistan Prime Minister Shriman Nawaz Sharif, and I gave him a suggestion.
That's the circumstantial countries have to take a combined strategy for emergency preparation.
I like this industry's good news through a table toxic exercise and excellent workshop of the sovereign countries held in Delhi.
Today, from the Jalandhar of Punjab, I received the call of Lakhwinder Singh: "I am speaking Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar district of Punjab.
We're here to cultivate biotechnology and learn how many people have to do so farming.
I have a question: People put fire on the roots of land, rubbles or wheat trees, and all the minute hungry bacteria that have the heart of the earth.
How can it explain to the people
And how can you get rid of the way Delhi, Haryana and Punjab are polluted
"Luckwinder Singhji, I like to hear your question.
It's a joy that you're working on biotechnology.
It's not yourself that you're farming in biotechnology, you can understand the problems of farmers too well.
Your idea is right.
But it's not just happening in Punjab, Haryana, this is happening all over India.
It's working to burn the crops like this after our nature and generation.
First, there was no idea of the damage that could happen, so we're doing this tradition.
Secondly, there was no training in any other way.
This tradition is going on and this temptation is increasing.
It was one of the reasons why the climate is decreasing due to the change of weather.
When the effects of these evils began to fall above the city, then the people were survivors against it.
The sadness you have expressed is right.
First of all, we have to give proper training to the farmers' brothers and sisters, they have to understand the reality.
The time will survive, the hard work will survive, the fields will be prepared for the next crop- but it's not right.
The height of the crop is very valuable.
It's a biography itself.
We're burning it and destroying it.
It's not the end, if these roots are crushed, they can be animals.
To burn this root, the upper level of agriculture is burning.
My farmer brothers and sisters, think
What if our bones, heartbeats, kidneys are good, if the skin is burnt, then what can happen
Shall we survive
I can't save my heart even if it's right.
As our skin is burnt, the skin of the earth becomes evil, the root of the crop is burnt, the skin of the earth is also burnt.
The upper level of our land burns, which drives our highlands to death.
And that's why we have to play a useful role.
Mix the heel of this crop into the ground, it'll be alright.
Or you're gonna find a hole and leave the kitchen and mix a little water, you're gonna get a better bio-service.
It's used as an animal.
It will save our land.
It's not all.
If this biological serpent is used in that land, it can be double profits.
I had a chance to talk to the artists.
They spoke of a very good experience.
In the past, when they used to cultivate art, they would have spent five thousand, sometimes ten or fifteen thousand rupees per hecket to clean the plants.
If the tracker wasn't found to clean it, the heels would fall like that.
Some farmers then buried these roots in a piece of six or eight inches.
Because there is so much water in the root of that art plant, if there is any tree, tree or vegetation, there is no need to give water separately for three months.
The water that contains in the roots of bananas, so keeps the crop alive.
Today, this banana plant has become very valuable to the farmers' brothers.
They can come from this heel.
The heel that had to spend their money before cleaning, is coming from him.
What a small effort can be beneficial.
Our farmer brothers are not less than scientists.
Dear countrymen, tomorrow 3rd December will celebrate the world's 'International Resistance Day'.
I talked about the organ donation in the last minute.
I told you about the Helpline of 'Noto' for organ donation.
I've been told that the number of phones has increased by seven times after the "Mon What Wat", has increased half the number of votes in the website.
On 27th November, the part of the species has been discharged as the Day of Donation.
A lot of distinguished people from the society, including Chitravinetry Robina Tandon.
Organ donation can save a lot of precious life.
It can bring immortality in a similar way.
When any part of the body is replaced from one body to another, it gets a new life.
That man also has a new life.
What could be greater than this
It is waiting for the establishment of the organs that all the patients can donate the organs - the name of a national level for them in the event of organ transplantation started from November 27-S.
A competition was organized at a national level through the mygov.in portal to create a note-logo, donor card and Shlogan in this regard.
I was surprised that many people took part in it.
People spoke in an innovative and sensitive manner.
I believe that there will be a widespread consciousness.
And it's true to go, he'll have a lot of help.
Because if people don't donate, it's not possible to get any help.
As I said earlier, on December 3, it was celebrated as a World Resistance Day.
Physical and psychological people have infinite courage and power.
I'm sorry only when someone ridicules them, please.
But if we change our vision, change our minds towards them, then it can become the inspiration of our lives and work.
We're crying when we're in a small problem.
Then I feel I'm sorry about how a little bit lives in comparison to these people
How are you working
How are you spending the day
That's why they're the source of inspiration.
I am sure that the immense effort to change their life's imagination, power, their way of fighting with life and the problem.
I want to talk about Javed's gentlemen today.
A man forty-two.
In 1998, Jabed Ahmad was shot by terrorists, but he didn't die.
In the militants, some part of kidney, small intestine and liver had to be searched for.
There was a serious injury in the spine.
The ability to stand in his legs ended like his side.
But Javed didn't lose ahamed.
The injury of the terrorists couldn't persuade him.
An innocent man is suffering from this kind of harm, life-threatening complication, but without expressing any kind of anger or irritation, Javed Ahmed fought these evils with sympathy.
That's his greatest psychological stability.
He employed his life to serve society.
It's not always powerful, but for the last twenty years she has been engaged in teaching children.
In public places, what arrangements should be made for the convenience of the responsibilities in the government office, what is necessary for their facilitation in government work, they are working.
He's also running his studies.
MA has done in social science and has become a devotee as a social worker and a conscious citizen.
Can the people of every territory of India get inspiration from the life of Javed
I will remember the life of Javed Ahmd on December 3, especially his self-consciousness in penance and human service.
Timely, I'm just talking about Javed, but I know the inspiration in every corner of India, which shows life a new way.
3rd December to remind all such inspirational people.
Our country is a big country.
There are many things in which people are dependent on the government.
There is a perfect relationship with government and government systems with middle-class, low-class, poverty, complicated, afflicted, deprived people.
As a citizen sometimes in life, there is a distinct experience from some government employees.
And this one-and-a-half bad experience makes life-for-threatening our government system.
It's true.
But sometimes these governments do such a good job in the symptoms of the community, which keeps our eyes away.
Sometimes we don't even know how good these government systems and these government employees are doing.
Because it's very obliged.
There's a network of hope workers across our country.
I've never heard of hope workers among our people in India, or you heard.
But the world-famous Industrial Family Bill Gates Foundation's success has become a bright example all over the world.
We've honored both Bill Gates and Milinda Gates for the first time.
They do many social works in India.
They're spending all their lives for the poor.
When they come to India, the hopes of the workers who got the opportunity to work, they appreciate them and cannot end the hope workers' work and service.
How enjoyed they learn new things.
They say this.
A few days ago, on the Independence Day, the Orissa government gave special respect to a hope worker.
The hope worker of Tendagaon, a small village in Orissa's Baleshwar district and all the residents of that place are included in the Tapashuti tribe.
Everyone in the tapashali tribe of that village belongs to poverty.
There's a lot of malaria inflammation.
Yamuna Monsing, a hopeful employee of this village, has decided not to let anyone in her own village die in malaria.
Somebody in the village gets a little fever and then goes to that house.
Based on the preliminary treatment he was taught, he started the treatment.
Each house has emphasized the use of insecticides.
Just like sleeping and taking care of your child, this hopeful worker Yamuna Monsing surrendered himself completely to save the entire village from mosquitoes and prepared all the villages to prevent malaria disease.
How many Yamuna Monsing is.
There are millions of people around us.
We'll try to see them in their respect.
These countries can become a bigger power.
We're always happy and sorry.
I'm honouring all hopeful workers through Yamuna Monising.
My dear young men, who are very active in the Internet and social media, I have put three e-books in mygov portal for them.
The first thing about 'Swachh Bharat', the second is related to the 'Adarsh Gram Sabha' and the third is health affairs.
I'm requesting you to see these e-books.
Not only yourself, but also others.
You might think of joining something with them.
Then send it to mygov portal.
A lot of events that don't look at us, but there's real power for society.
The right point of view is our greatest power.
You're gonna share the same thing with me.
Share these e-books in yourself, discuss e-books, and if any enjoyable youngsters go to the nearby school and tell them about this e-book of eighth, nineteen or tenth, you can be a social teacher.
I'm calling you, come, join you in the work of nation planning.
My favourite countrymen are worried about global climate change.
The world's warmth, the climate change is now the most light and thought.
Before every work, it is recognized as an instruction.
The temperature of the world does not increase - it should be thoughtful and determined of all.
The first way to save the temperature from the growth is the protection of energy.
The National Energy Conservation Day of 14th December i . e . the ' Several Energy Conservation Day ' .
Several projects have been launched on behalf of the government.
The L-E-D Balb's project is underway.
I once told you that the light of the road should be bathed in the full moonlight after hours by shutting the light of the night of full moon.
The ray of that moon should be felt.
Any friend sent me a link like this to see him and I had a chance to see.
So I think I'll tell you this.
But it's the credit of Jee News.
Because this link was Jee News.
A woman named Nurjahana in Kanpur, who didn't understand that she had a chance to study on TV, did something that nobody thought of.
He's gonna use solar power from the sunlight to give power to the poor.
He's fighting darkness and brightening his name.
He made a committee of women, created a factory to build solar power-power competing and rented competings for a monthly hundred rupees.
People take the communications in the evening, re-charge in the morning.
And in many numbers - I heard about five hundred families took a fight.
It costs about three to four rupees everyday, but there is enough light in the room.
This Nurjahan recharged these negotiations through this solar power in that factory all day long.
Look, bigger people in the world are doing a lot to change the climate, but a Nurjahan thinks he can inspire all of them, doing the same thing.
In fact, the name of Nurjahan is to illuminate the world.
That's how he's spreading light.
I'm congratulating Nurjahan and G TV with him.
Because J.T.V. has taken up this incident in a small place in Kanpur in front of the country and the whole world.
Many congratulations.
Calling me to Shri Abhishan Kumar Pond of Uttar Pradesh, he said, "Namskar, I am speaking from Gorakhpur to Abhishan Kumar Pond.
I work as an industrialist.
I want to convince the honorable Prime Minister that he started a project with the currency bank.
I want to know from the Prime Minister, how can this currency bank project help us like us
How can I help you
"Thank you for the message you sent from Gorakhpur.
"Prime Minister Monetary Plan" is "Fund the Unfunded".
Those who don't have the basics, they'll get the basics.
And the objective is that if I understand in easy language, three "E" - Enterprise, Earning, Empowerment.
This project encourages Enterprise, gives money a chance of employment and provides power in the right sense.
This monetary project is underway to help small industries.
Anyway, I want to move fast, it's still the pace.
But it's good at the beginning.
In such a short time, a million people have been given 30,000 crore rupees through the 'Prime Minister's Monetary Plan'.
There are also newspaper sellers, milk sellers or small businessmen among these millions.
It's funny, twenty-five lady among these.
Most of the hypocrisy tribes, hypocrisy tribes and other unrestricted people are working on their own and trying to run their families with respect.
The Abhishek spoke of his own enthusiasm.
There's a lot of news coming to me.
One of them said now, there's someone named Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He got a loan of eight and a half million rupees from the bank through the currency project.
And he started the carboy of the pair system.
I told you at the time of my voluntary expedition that this campaign would create a new industrialist.
And the majesty did it in Shailesh Bhosle.
He bought a tank and I knew he had already returned the bank two lakhs.
In fact, this is the purpose of our currency project.
Someone told me about Bhupal's Mamata Sharma that he got 40,000 rupees from the bank through the "Prime Minister Mudray Yojana".
He's working to make Batua.
Earlier, he used to drive this business very hard to borrow money on the rope.
Now you can do your job better to get a lot of money right.
It costs more than Rs. 1,000 each month to get this money back for the first ride and other reasons.
And a good business for his family.
But I want this plan to be more propaganda.
All our banks will be more sensitive and help small businessmen.
In fact, the country's authority is run by these.
People employed in small tasks are the real power of the economy of the country.
We're gonna give importance to it.
Well done, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, October 31, in the birth anniversary of the Sardar Pattel, I spoke of "A India, Best India".
There are many things that make sense of consciousness in our society.
International Vigilance is the Prize of the Liberty i.e. the Prize of Freedom will be internal security.
To maintain the unity of the country, this internal security river must be flown.
'A India - the best India ' - I want to give it a plan.
In the portal, I wanted to agree.
What will be the structure of the plan, what will be the symbol, how to increase the participation of the people in this plan - I have agreed on various matters.
I'm told that there's a lot of suggestions.
But I'm waiting for some more opinion.
I'm waiting for some specific plan.
I've been told that they're gonna take part of it, they're gonna have a supplement.
A big prize has also been announced.
You also use your creativity.
This word of unity and integrity, how every Indian can be accommodated through this verse of an India-the best India, what plans can be taken, what will be done, beauty, lifelong and easy for every human relationship. .
What the government will do, what the society will do, what the scholar will do - there's a lot of things.
I believe your advice will work very much.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter season begins.
It's a nice time to wear food and numerous dress.
Then I'll say, do exercise.
In order to keep the body healthy, keep some time exercise in this beautiful season, for yoga.
Start it even in the family.
At least one hour of the family, look at how kind of awareness will increase, and how fresh it will be.
Be good habits in good weather.
My favourite countrymen are very happy once more
Jai Hind
