Prime Minister Mr.
Narendra Modi, on 30th June, 2017, at 11 a.m., says the Tamilnadu language of the special exhibition conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population, my dearest residents.
Good luck.
It is the speciality of human mind that the rains attract the mind.
The birds and plants of nature are pleased with the rainy season.
But when the rain shows a terrible look, you know how much water is capable of destruction.
Nature gives us life, destroys us.
But sometimes the floods, the terrible natural evils, the terrible size of the terrible destruction.
There are very negative conditions due to change in weather and environment.
For the past few days, in some parts of India, especially in Assam, north-eastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal, people had to suffer great calamities.
There are continuous surveillance in flood affected areas.
They're taking protection on the widespread head.
My colleagues are going to the ministry wherever they can.
State governments are also trying hard to help the infected people in their own way.
The citizens working with social organisations and cultural organisations are also trying their best to help people in this situation.
From the Government of India, the soldiers, the Air Force, the NDRF, the Armed Forces, etc. worked with life to help the victims of white pollution.
Life becomes very funny due to waterfalls.
The crops and animal resources, the basic facilities, the roads, the electricity and the warriors are all in danger.
Insurance companies, specially, have made plans to speed up the climate settlement of Planning Insurance Companies, especially for the damage caused by our farmers and crops.
Controlrum Help Line Number 1078 continuously operates 247 (eventh and seven days a week) to face the flood.
People say their problems.
In many places before the year, the government has prepared a mock drill.
The NDRF team was appointed.
To create dangerous combat companions at different places, to train them and not to do, to determine the competitive workers, to combat people's composition and face such situations.
Climate warnings are roughly available due to the growth of technology and the progress made in environmental science.
According to the climate signal, the time round of our operations is slowly transformed into a nature and we can escape from great evils.
When I prepare for Man Kee Ba, the citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time, J.
S.
T.
A lot of letters and phone calls came about you.
People still express happiness about GST and curiosity.
A focal was like this.
"Namaskar Prime Minister, I speak from Gudga and Nithu Garga.
I heard your speech on Chartered Accountants Day.
It affected me very much.
Likewise, the Goods and Surveys Tax started this day last month.
Can you tell me if the government is expected to see it after a month
I want to know your opinion about this.
Thank you.
'GST has been implemented for almost a month, its results have begun.
GST costs a poor supplies.
I'm very happy to hear things are cheap.
In the north-eastern regions, a person living in the wild mountains, a person living in the jungle area, I felt really frightened, and I felt simple and simple when I wrote the words that I began to understand.
How was the impact of GST in the Transport-Logistics sector
Track pockets are increasing.
It's seen how much the time goes from one place to another and the crowd of highways is low.
Due to the speed of the trucks, the pollution has decreased.
Going to the targets quickly.
These facilities are available, but there's a pace of economic growth.
Because there were already different tax structures, seals in the Transport-Logistic sector were very high.
So new hair houses were to be built in all the states.
GST, I would like to say good and simple taxes, had a very optimistic situation in our economy, and it was too short.
How quickly it changed, how fast it turned from one way to another, new registrations were conducted through which the whole country has become a new faith.
But once again, financial experts, management experts, technical experts, I believe in researching the GST of India as a model in the world.
A case stand will be formed for all universities in the world.
Because such a big change in such a large quantity has brought us to the peak of success in such a big country, with the participation of millions of people.
The world must learn about it.
All states have a share in the implementation of this GST, and the responsibility of all states.
All the decisions and the States and the Central Government have been taken together by the Econtinent.
That's why all the governments predicted that GST does not burden the poor utensil.
GST will know what was the cost of a thing before the GST was implemented, and what would be worth in a new situation.
What a big dream of 'a country-a tax' has succeeded.
In GST, I could see how the officials from the village to the centre worked in devotion, how cordial the atmosphere was created between the government and the traders, the government and the consumers.
I appreciate all the ministries, all the departments, all the officers of the Central-Central Government.
GST is an excellent example of the victory of India's social power.
It's a historical fate.
It's not just tax efficiency, but it's an economic system that powers the culture of a new faith.
In a way, it's the beginning of social transformation.
I reproduce millions of natives for the success of such a great effort.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of revolution.
This is what we've heard since childhood.
The 1920 Agest launched a detentional strike, 1942 Age 9 started the Chhodo Andalon (Cwit India Movement).
This is known by the name of August Kranti.
The country was free on August 15, 1947.
In August, there are many events related to freedom.
This year we are going to celebrate the fifth anniversary of India Chhodo Andalan.
But Dr.
Lots of people know that Yusuf Meher Ali has given the status of 'Bharat Chodo'.
We need to know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, people joined the freedom fighter, inspired and suffered.
The breezes of history are the inspiration for a magnificent Indian creation.
What is greater inspiration than the freedom fighters sacrificed, sacrificed, sacrificed.
India Chhodo Andalon was a great fight for the Indian freedom struggle.
The movement was inspired by the vision of the country to escape from the British rule.
India's masses together against the British rule.
India has become part of Chhodo Andalon in every corner of Hindustan , including literate , illiterate , rich and rich in villages and cities .
The masses had reached Paramia.
According to Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were insisting on fighting with the witch of acting or dying.
Millions of young people in the country examined their studies and sent books.
They went off the sword of freedom.
Mahatma Gandhi left the name of Chhodo on August 9, but the British ruler had put the big leaders in jail.
That's the second generation of the country, Dr.
Great men like Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayana were priests.
Disciplination Summit and India Chhodo Andal showed two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi in 1920 and 1942.
The shape and imagination of the deterioration was different.
In 1942, the wisdom of the Mahatma, like Mahatma Gandhi, would have been supposed to be a messenger to work or die.
There was a democracy behind this success, the ability of the people, the vision of the people, the struggle for the people.
The whole country fought together.
I sometimes think of how to enclose the bats of history.
The first freedom struggle took place in 1857.
The movement that took place in some parts of the country till the year 1942.
This long-term life was born in the minds of the people.
Everyone was sure to do something.
Even though generations have passed, there was no shortage of vision.
People came and joined, went and new people came, new people joined.
The country continued to permissure the British rule.
This work, which took place from 1857 to 1942, brought this summit to its heir in 1942.
Within 5 years, the British will have to leave India in 1947.
In 1857-1942, freedom came to all the people.
Five years 1942 - 1947.
It's a responsibilities to be observed.
For the last few years.
It turned out to be a successful gain of freedom.
These five years were determined.
I'd like to connect you with this math.
We got freedom in 1947.
Today is 2017.
About 70 years.
The government has come.
The systems are formed, turned away.
Grown up, moved.
To escape from the problems of the country, to overcome poverty, efforts have been made to develop.
Everyone worked as their own.
It's a success.
Expectations are awake.
Like it was a decisive year to observe from 1942 to 1947.
From 2017 to 2022, five years have come in front of us.
The August 15 of 2017 will celebrate the occasion of vision.
In 2022, when 75 years of independence, we must achieve this.
Hundreds of five and a half million people, remembering the revolution day August 9, will take this view as a citizen and as a citizen - I will do it for the country, as a family, as a society, it will do it as a village and a city, as a government department, as a government.
Millions of determinations.
Try to fulfil millions of determinations.
So, for five years of independence from 1942 to 1947, it can be decided from 2017 to 2022 for the future of India.
We have to make sure.
After five years, the country's freedom will be celebrated for the fifth year.
We have to take a look at that.
2017 must be our dream year.
Be part of the sight of the August month.
We have to decide that dirt - leave India, poverty - leave India, corruption - leave India, voluntary India.
Today it is not necessary to work or die, but to join a new India dream, to work with the mind and body to achieve success.
Live with this dream, try.
Come on, let's take a great initiative for the dreams of August 8.
Every Indian, social organisation, local administration, schools, colleges, and various organizations should take a look at the new India.
Anything to be witnessed within the next five years.
Social discussions can be organized for youth structures, student structures, governmental welfare units etc.
Let's bring new ideas forward.
Where do we have to come as a nation
What can be my contribution as a person
Come on, let's take a look at this.
I'm particularly inviting online youth friends in the world.
Come forward to give new contributions to the new Indian constitution.
The online world is connected to each other anywhere.
Proceed with technologies, video, post, blog, articles, new ideas.
Make this goal a public.
The uitinth ues begins for the youth in the Nandermodi app.
This problem is an attempt to introduce the freedom fighters to connect youngsters with the proud history of the country.
You must give it a widespread propaganda and bring it to the people.
My dear countrymen, I get the opportunity to comprehend the country from the red fort as the principal servant of the country on August 15.
I'm just a sweetheart.
There's no person speaking.
From the red fort, hundreds of five fountains of the country rose the gold of the people.
I'm trying to make their dreams shout.
For the last three years, I get the opinions from all the corners of the country to speak on August 15.
I'm supposed to say what's wrong.
I'm inviting you this time too.
Definitely know your opinion on the My Gave app or Narendramodi app.
I read it myself and try to talk about them in time until August 15 arrives.
I've received a complaint from August 15 for the last three times what's going on.
So it's decided to make a little smaller.
I think it's finished at 40-45-50 minutes.
I don't know if I decide in my own way or not.
The speech is determined to try to reduce.
See if you can or not.
Dear countrymen, I'd like to say something today.
There is a social economic science in India's economy.
We don't ever see it cheaper.
Our festivals and festivals are not just occasions to be happy.
Our festivals and celebrations are the tricks of socialization.
But all the festivals are directly related to poor economic life.
For a few days, the guardian, the birth anniversary.
And the Ganesh festival, after that, Chauth Chandra, and Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Deepawali etc. will come together.
It's a chance for the poor to become financial.
There's a natural joy in these festivals.
Festivals spread sweetness to relationships, brings love in the family and adventure in society.
Connects the person and the society.
There's a comfortable journey from the person to the samsti.
It's a chance to go from me to us.
According to the financial system, since many months before the Raksha Bandhan, there are rakhis in small hut areas in hundreds of families.
There are many types of rakhs in Khadi Muthal , Patunul Pare .
And those who love the Hommed queens are now built in the house.
Thousands of jobs are linked to this festival, the queen sellers, the sellers of sweet sweets.
The families of our dear sister-in-law live.
We burn the lamps to Deepawali - it's not the celebration of a light.
It's not just celebrations or houses are decorated.
It's connected directly with the poor families built by the sand.
But today I want to talk about the festivals and the economics of poverty related to them as well as the environment.
I'm supposed to see something more than the people of this country are aware and more active.
For the past one month, the cautious citizens write me letters about the environment.
They have acknowledged that in Ganesh Chaturthi, people have a chance to plan to prefer a soiled genesis.
I'm supposed to be cautious.
They're asking you to tell me earlier.
This time the General Ganesh festival is specially important.
This great celebration was started by the world-wide artist.
It's 20th anniversary of the General Ganesh festival.
Ganeshotsav started on the basis of a concept for the creation of social culture and creation of the unity and society of the universal craftsman society.
Connected with Ganeshotsas this year, the articles should be held, the discussions should be held, remember the contributions of the Word of the Witness.
Think about how to take the Ganesh festival on the lines of Tilak's imagination.
Think how to strengthen that vision again.
At the same time, for the protection of the environment, environmental friends should be a generator made of soil.
I'm saying this this time.
I'm sure you'll be with me.
It will help its sculptures and poor artists.
They will get jobs by making idols.
The poor's stomach is full.
Come, let's connect our festivals with poverty, connect with poverty's economic status, the happiness of our celebrations can make the poor economic celebrations.
We have to try this.
I celebrate all the natives for various festivals, many funnies for festivals.
My dear countrymen, the country's educational sector, the economic sector, but the socio-sports sector, but our country's girls are constantly watching the country's heights and heights.
We, people in this country feel proud of our girls.
Last day our girls showed the best performance in the World Cup of Women's Cricket.
I got a chance to talk to the girls this week.
I felt very happy, but they realized that they didn't want to win the World Cup.
The pressure on their face, the conflict was provoked.
I guess things differently in that conversation.
I said, look, the media's hopes are very much during this period.
If you don't get success, then you'll be angry.
If the sportsmen of India fail, we've seen the country's rage blooming games in front of those players.
Some will speak and write in a painful language.
But when our girls won the World Cup match, hundreds of twenty-twenty-five people saw that defeat their first defeat.
A little weight didn't fall on the girls.
That's not the only thing that proclaimed the achievement of those children, proud of it.
I see this comfortable change.
I squeezed them and said you've got so much luck.
He said you didn't win.
You said you won the minds of hundreds of five hundred people, even if you win the game.
The youngest room in the country, especially our girls actually work a lot to promote our country.
I appreciate the young woman of the country, especially our girls, and the spectacles.
Dear countrymen, I recall the Agust revolution, reminds Agust 9 again, remembers August 15 again.
2022 recalls the fifth anniversary of freedom.
Make sure all the natives, prepare five-year plans for all the countrymen to dream.
We have to take the new heights of the country, bring them.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
Let's move with the confidence of the future of the country to be shine.
A lot of good luck.
Thank you.
