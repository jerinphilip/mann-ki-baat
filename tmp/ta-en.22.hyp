Prime Minister Mr.
In the All India Radical Activity, Narendra Modi, on the day of singing the coincidence of the conversation titled Man Geepat (Mandi's voice): 30.
40.
I'm folks, sweetheart.
Before every heart's voice program, from every corner of the country, from all ages, there are admirable suggestions regarding the voice of the mind.
Akashwani writes, Narendra Modi's work, MyGov's suggestions are available.
I see them when I get the time, it's a pleasant experience for me.
Affected information is available.
Energies are filled in every corner of the country.
Like Sathakan, there are so many individuals engaged in social work, they may not even have a government partnership in the affiliated sectors, and the problems of that kind are found to be rigid.
They can be favoured by government organisations.
Different kinds of things come to the eyes of the neighbours of the children, the love of the youth, the energy of the experiences of the elders.
Every time such powerful instruments come in the church of the mind, which are conducted by various government levels.
What kind of advice
What kind of books
What's the experience of people
Normally we can see that humans are natural to provide advice to others.
In trains, when we travel in buses, somebody gets coughed, somebody's suggestions to do this, tell us that it's natural here.
Initially, when the suggestions of the mind came to the hole, the suggestions were found in them, it could be an obvious practice for many people, but when we tried to see it, I really floated in a very pleasant flood.
Those who give more advice, whoever tries to try my ears, they're supposed to be made in their lives.
Those who are engaged in your environment with your intelligence, energy, power, etc. in your work.
I thought these suggestions weren't normal when all these things came to me.
These are the exhibitions of the hazardous experience.
Some people, if an idea is successful in some places, they can know about it and many more, through which it can spread further, so that more people will get benefits.
That's why they're in mind that they have to express their views on the hole of the mind.
That's all you made in my vision.
Most of the suggestions are available only from the workers who are pregnant, they are very proud to ever do something better for the community.
I'm apprising them of my thanks.
Not only this, if I agree about a thing, it's very enjoying the exhibitions coming from the people.
Some people had suggestions about eating in the cheeks of the past, writing your concerns about it, which I showed.
After I was switched, in the Narender Mody Activity, MyGov, lets all the snacks of the country, the new commodities that stop the food stop, don't wear.
Especially our country's young heads, I don't even think they've been busy working for a long time.
We have been aware of some social structures for many years, but the youth of my country are engaged in it - it came to know only after me.
Many have sent me video.
Roti banks are run in many places.
People give bread in the bread bank, bread from their own level, bring vegetables, whoever needs, they come and get them.
Those who give joy, those who go for you don't need to think down.
It's an example of how to work in the community.
Today's the last day of April.
Today is the month of April.
The organization of Gujarat, Maharashtra States comes in the month of May.
In this case, the people of both the states are happy with my charge.
Both states have been engaged in continuous efforts for new development peaks.
The country's progress has been divided.
In both the states, the great men have been born continuously, every section of the society has given us their lives admonition.
Remembering these great men, on the day of the rise of the States, on the day of 2022, 75 years of independence, we have to make our states, our nation, our society, our city, our families the day of Upgradation of the state.
The plans to roam that conviction, we have to go ahead with all the citizens.
I'm gonna introduce my life again to these two states.
At one time the environment was changed, the only thing that was spoken on the basis of pregnancy.
But now, in our daily life, we're feeling it, hypnotises.
Nature has changed all its methods of catastrophe.
In our country the temperature we see in the months of May - June is experienced this time only in the months of March - April .
If I've been examining people's suggestions for the cheeks of the mind, there were many suggestions about what we should do during the summer.
All things are exposed, not new, but it would be very useful to see them again if they were right.
Prasant Kumar Misra, T.
S.
Many friends like Karthik have expressed their views about birds.
They're supposed to put water in the balcony, upper streams.
I've seen little boys in the family specializing this thing.
They're gonna come to see why they're gonna fill the water ten times a day, if there's water in the utensil.
Besides this the birds come and drink water , they keep looking at the sight of the eye .
It may appear like a game, but in fact, the surprising experience of the throat in that little mind is encouraging.
If there is an attraction to birds and birds then the new joy can also be seen in your mind .
A few days ago, Jakat Pai, who had accompanied Gujarat, sent me a book, in this book on the head of Save the Sparrows, showed his concern about the number of gurus that came down.
In the same way, what efforts did he try to protect them with a psychologist, in the book about what kind of methods he did.
In our country, birds and birds, natural musical lifestyles are naturally present in our nervous systems.
But in the same way, it is important that efforts should be made on social level.
If I was the first member of the state of Gujarat then the Dharmaguru of the Bohra community was 100 years old .
He lived for 103 years.
As he celebrated for 100 years, the Bohra community members conducted the biggest campaign to protect the gurus through the Purhani rock.
I knew it was the starting bandage.
For only 52,000 birds , cereals , birds , cereals , snacks , birds , snakes , snacks , birds , etc . , they have displayed the instruments of the world .
Kinnas' world சாதனைs were also found in the book.
Sometimes if we're busy in any way, then we're forgetting if we're gonna have a mouth water to drink in this summer, if we're selling parents, vegetables, dapagers.
My little friends, I'd like to finish some things with you.
Sometimes I'm worried that many of our young guys want to live in a comfortable place, synchronous circle.
My parents enhance them very safely.
There is such a secret that there are other guardians, but most of them are in sympathy.
Now the selections are possible.
You're planning to spend holidays.
The summer holidays will be sweet after the summer stops.
But I'd like to share some things with you about how your friend's holiday should be.
Some people will certainly act, I believe I'm aware of it.
I'm gonna give you three suggestions to use the holiday season, in which you're special, but it's important to do something in them.
Get a new experience, get a new efficiency, make sure that no one should go to a place without ignorance, unconscious, unknown, unknown.
New places, new experiences, new capabilities.
There is a difference between the Earth and the Earth between the air between seeing a thing in TV or feeling it experienced by reading in the book itself .
You want to know where you want to go during this holiday, look at it with a new test.
You have to be prepared for the test, get out of your square circle.
We're in the middle family, smooth families.
But without preference take 2 square seats in the blood and take a journey of at least 24 hours .
Look what experience is available.
What those travellers talk about, what they do after landing at the railway stations, you are unable to learn from you throughout the year in 24 hours, you will get to sleep in a crowded royal royal royal royal royal royal royalty, and you will get through the experience of the stopping journey .
I'll see you once
I didn't say you do this again, look at one or two times.
In the evening take your shoes , kids or other sports and go to the dwelling area of the adjoining sports .
Look at the poor kids there, so far you have the joy of playing in your life and then you will feel the gain of yours.
Didn't you imagine how big they're going to change in life when children get deep sleeping and playing with you
If you go once, your mind will hope to go back there again.
This experience will teach you many.
Many self-constitutions are engaged in service.
You find yourself connected to the Khukul Guru.
Connect yourself for 15 days, 20 days with something.
Sometimes warmth will be carried out, the generosity will be advanced, many types of arrangements will be conducted, connect yourself with them.
After mixing in such cases, after you have chosen, freely, teach them the chances of learning, learning them as a service.
You can teach them how to do.
Technically, it is believed that the distances have been deteriorated, the harmful effects that have taken place are straying my mind.
Six people in the same house are sitting in the same room but they cannot even imagine the distance between them.
Why
Everybody's being foolish because of technology.
Social nature is a good fat, social nature is a power.
I've demonstrated another thing about capabilities.
Doesn't your mind want to learn something new
It's a world full of competitions.
We're scared at the exams.
We're on the edge to get the most valuable values.
Even in the holidays, some people go to the training classes, skipping the next question.
Sometimes there is also a miracle of our young ropos.
Does the machine live in our little headlines
Friends, you're all good things we're dreaming high in life.
The idea of slaughtering something is good, that's how you slave it.
But we shouldn't see the human sayings inside us, we should be careful not leaving our humanity and leaving us away.
Can't we pay attention to the competence
Away from technology, we try to spend time with us.
Musician can learn to sing somebody, learn from 5 to 50 words of a new language, which has been a language of teachings, Telungo, Assamese, Bengali, Malalamo, Gujaratio, Maratia, Punjabio.
Our country is full of confusion, if we turn our vision around, somebody will learn.
If you don't know, you can learn swimming, you can learn paintings, you can't get the most special turbulence, but the paper's mine
Your inner feelings begin to reflect in it.
Even small things, why don't we learn
It looks like learning.
Do you want to learn car drive
Does auto rickshaw want to drive
Learn the drive, you might know the cycling, but try to drive 3 square cycles.
All these capabilities, these activities will enjoy you, but it will not only remove the controls that bind yourself on a single charge.
Do something different, friends
It's your chance to build your lives.
After all the exams were completed, when you came to a new level in your business, you said it was all I imagined, that chance didn't get you.
Then you may have to hiccup in another problem, so I'd like to tell you if there's a magic learning country, and learn the magic.
Enjoy doing this in your friends.
If you don't know anything, learn it, it'll definitely benefit you.
Awaken the comprehensive forces inside yourself.
It's gonna set up a very low level for development.
In my experience, we can't even imagine how many things we have to understand in the world are friends.
There are new places, new cities, new villages, new new areas.
But before going there, where you're going to know about it, go with learning, understand, join people, get married, enjoy yourself when you're engaged in this effort.
You must try.
Don't think of traveling too much.
Go to me and spend 3-4 days there, then go to the next place and spend 3-4 days there.
Through this you'll get lots of things to learn.
I'm asking you must send me pictures about the places you go.
Where you see what's new, where you go, take these experiences using the incredible india.
Friends, this time the Government of India has given you the most excellent opportunity.
The new guys have left almost a lot of comfort.
They're starting to trust the digital money supply.
You're involved in anything but you can also compensate through this project.
Do you know about a plan of Government of India
BHIM APP, that's why you're supposed to give beam worker, you're gonna use it.
But someone else can recommend it.
You can connect others with this, if those new men do 3 differentiations through it, you will get 10 rupees for this.
10 rupees will be included in your state level.
If one day you tell 20 people to join it, you'll be paid 200 rupees in the evening.
Merchants can also compensate with this, students also get the money through it.
This program will be held on October 14th.
Building digital India, you take your partnership.
You're the cops of New India.
Holiday holidays, champagne for champagne.
Recommend, pay the money.
Hand this knee.
Commonly in our country, Vi.
I.
B.
It is now that even a circumventurous environment against culture , this culture is deeper .
Whatever is the chief minister, the government has agreed that India should not be able to bring the red light on her car.
It's a kind of v.
I.
B.
Culture has been marked, but even in the red light vehicle, it gradually dropped into the brain, V.
I.
B.
Culture has been buried.
Now the red light has become synonymous, but nobody can say that the red light on the brain has been stopped.
I got a very nice phone call.
The speaker expressed his concern about this, but the simple dweller didn't want it.
He feels he's away.
He's the Prime Minister, from the Jabalpur of Madhya Pradesh, I'm speaking Shiva Saube.
I'd like to talk about the red light.
Every Indian dweller on the road.
I.
B.
I read a smell on the news that's right.
After reading this, I had a great drink in my mind, and I had the pleasure of the time too important.
I don't want to shrink the traffic, nobody else I don't need to wait.
That's why I'd like to convince you my neighbouring thanks because of this conclusion you've done.
We didn't clean our country only because of the pure India operation you've carried, our roads and w.
I.
B.
They're clean and smooth.
Thank you again for slaughtering it. "
The government's decision to absorb the red light is a mechanism.
But this culture has to be rooted in the mind.
It can be removed if we try to combine with awareness.
That's our principle of new India.
I.
B.
It's in the place of the name.

I.
That's what we should give importance to.
I'm V.

It's in the place of the name.

My point of view is clear when I say, "Everybource is Important, everybody's important."
Everyone has a significance, if we accept the importance of 125 crores of people, 125 crores of people, if we realize the importance of the people of the country, the greatest dreams will also be the largest energy to wealth.
It's gonna be connected to us.
Loveful folks, we're coming back to tell you that our history, our culture, must be reminding our tradition.
From that we get the biggest slope and the excitement.
This year 125 crore people of the country celebrate the 1000th year of Maha Ramanujar .
Because of some reason we've been chickened in the days, we've been very sweet, we've been thinking about more than a century.
In other countries of the world it is believed to be very important for centuries.
But how many ancient countries of India , there is a band of celebrating memories of thousands of years old .
How was the community about a thousand years ago
How was his idea
Look at the guess.
Even today, it's so hard to come out with social conditions
How was it about a thousand years ago
Some know that Ramanuzar has created a great struggle against the status of royalism, the emotion of the supreme suppressors, the supremacy of the community.
The community believed that someone was a slave, slapped him and showed him through his operation.
Hundreds of years ago, he campaigned for his temple project, successfully performed the temple project.
In every age, how many great men have been born to fatigue the troubles of our community, we feel how harmful we have done.
We celebrate the 1000th year of the shrine of Ramanujacharya, in this way, for the sake of social unity, we shall gain a sense of energy from him.
On the 1st day of the month of May the Government of India is demonstrating a tap head in the memory of the pilgrimage Ramanujacharya .
I respect the Holy Lord Ramanujacharya, to see flowers of my faith.
My little folks, tomorrow is one more important than 1st month of May.
In many parts of the world it is used daily .
When the laborers speak daily, there is talk about hard work, businessmen.
Naturally, I also remember the Baba Saheb Ambethagar.
Today, we're supposed to thank Papa Saheb for the recognition of the businessmen.
Bapa Saheb's participant is unforgettable for the health of the laborers.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb, when the pilgrimage Ramanujacharya was speaking, the greatest pilgrimage and social reformist Jagatguru Pashavesvara of Karnataka, who lived in 12th century, has also got the chance to remember them.
He's got a chance to reveal his symptoms.
In the 12th century in the language of Kannada, he wrote deep concepts about labor and labor.
In the language of Kannada, he says, "Kaya Kave Kailasa", whose meaning is that you can only reach the calamity of Lord Shiva through work, that only by doing the work will be good.
If you want to say it in other words, it's red to work.
I've been telling you that "Shrimeva Jayadee" is the rise of hard work, I've come to talk about the mirror of hard work.
The Indian Musthur Sangh's organization, the sensitivity of the sensitivity, Tengti, has always remembered what they repeatedly say - on one side the mobilisation principle has emerged, the idea of "the world's workers should be together".
But the coconut is that they change it, in order to drive the Indian territory, "Compaign us, we will unite the world".
It's a natural thing to think of them if you're talking about laborers.
My lovely folks, after a few days, we are celebrating Buddhist Purnima.
All over the world Lord Buddhists enjoy this festival .
When the world meets today, the war, the destruction of weapons, etc., the ideas of Lord Buddha are very sufficient.
The life of Ashoka in India is a unique example of the war of Buddha .
This celebrated day of Buddhist Purnima is celebrated as the special day of the United Nations Conference .
This year, this massacre is going on in the world.
On this sacred day indian Lord Buddha is supposed to dedicate my Anjali flowers .
There is a possibility of abundance of Buddha's memories in my mind.
My favourite folks, in India, have always been trying to convince the religious mission to ensure progress of all.
When we say that everyone's progress, it's not just talking about the people of India, telling about everyone in the world.
Especially speaking for our local countries.
We're supposed to be singing with foreign countries, and they're gonna have to advance.
There are many possible signs.
On the 5th day of the month of May , India is paid in the artificial courtyard .
Due to the capacity of this artificial column and the facilities available in it, there will be immense support for economic and development processes in Tethakasia.
As a matter of identification of natural resources, terminology, educational department, very deep computer, people have interconnects.
This artificial plan of Telkasia is fully supported by moving ahead of the economy.
This is an unprecedented gift of India .
It's an excellent specimen for our end.
I'm sure I'm supposed to be engaged in this important effort, the television centres connected to this brilliant artifact.
My folks, the heat is high, pay attention to your dependents, take care of yourself.
Lives full of heart.
Thank you.
.
