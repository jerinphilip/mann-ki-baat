Man Kee Bath, 2018, the Prime Minister's "Mans" says, "The finished form of the fifth square."
Dear countrymen, today once again, we have the luck to communicate with you through the 'Mon Ki Bath' program.
A cricket match was held in Bangalore a few days ago.
You know that I'm talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
This was the first international match of Afghanistan.
This game in the history of Afghanistan was with India, which is proud of all Indians.
Two teams showed good performance in this game.
From the side of Afghanistan, Bowler Rashid Khan has seen a good show in IPL this year.
I remember, the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, tagged me and said, "The people of Afghanistan are proud of his hero Rasheed Khan.
I am thankful to my Indian friends for preparing our sports to show their ability.
Rashed Khan represents the big sportsmen in Afghanistan.
He's a wealth in the world of cricket.
'He wrote this as a little joke with him, 'No, we don't mean to give him anymore.
'This game will be remembered.
It was the first game to remember it was natural.
But I remember this game. It's a different matter.
The Indian team has done something that's a model for the whole world.
At the time of buying the Indian team trophy, the Afghanistan team, who was part of the international competition, called together and took photographs.
What's Sportsman Spirit, we can understand what the Sportsmanship is.
The games are a very good opportunity to find and find their talents in our youths, to unite society.
My good wishes for the teams of India and Afghanistan.
I believe we're going to participate in the same sportsman Spirit.
Dear countrymen, the fourth day of Yoga on June 21 was a different sight.
I see it all over the world.
Throughout the world, people have done yoga with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
In Brussels, the European Parliament and the United Nations of New York, in the battlefields of the Navy of Japan, people all over the country.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, the yoga took place as a history.
All the asanas have been displayed as women.
In the high snow covered peak of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China together practiced yoga.
Yoga is the one thing to harm people by destroying all borders.
Thousands of excited people in more than 100 countries have made this festivities a big festival without castes, religions, regions, colors and women.
In India, it is natural to have a twin excitement that people from all over the world participated in the programs of the day of Yoga with great enthusiasm.
It is proud of the country that hundreds of twenty-twenty-five people have organized yoga in the security forces of our country.
Some heroes performed yoga in the inner vessel, some performed yoga in the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force, in the sky, sacrificed everybody at a height of ten thousand feet from Earth.
The sight is that they were swimming in the sky, not on the plane.
Yoga was organized in schools and colleges and offices and parks and high buildings and sports.
A scene in Ahmedabad was a heart attack.
There, about 750 divine brothers and sisters established the world by doing yoga at one place.
Yoga species, religion, and regions together the people of the world.
For centuries, we believe in the dwelling family.
Our sages, sages and mines, and other rituals, showed it in the middle of the yoga literature.
Today, I think Yoga is a revolutionary thing in the healthcare.
I think the initiative of yoga will go far and wide.
Most people make it part of their lives.
Dear countrymen, I've written a lot about My Geovi, Nardarmodi App, about the Documents Dae coming to Julai in Man Kee Bay this time.
It's right.
Just remember the doctor when we get a problem.
But it's a day to take advantage of our doctors.
On this occasion, it's a great opportunity to thank them for the service and dedication of the community.
We are the ones who worship Mother as God.
Looks like God, because Mother gives us birth.
Many doctors regenerate when they give birth to their mother.
The role of the doctor is not limited to the treatment of the disease.
Sometimes the doctor is like family friends.
They're guiding our lifestyle.
'The Note One Cure But Olso Heel.
"Today doctors have a great deal of experience about the general lifestyle, how they affect our lives.
Indian doctors have created their personal mudra all over the world with their ability and nipunya.
The chiefs of the medical field are known to solve the problem of therapy fabricated with hard work.
Through Man Keyba, I take good luck for all the people on the occasion of Dr. Dey, our doctor friends on July 1.
Dear people, we're lucky to be born in this Indian land.
India has a rich history of a month or day without any history.
Be careful, every region of India has a tradition of its own.
There'll be some rituals related to it, there will be great princes, famous people.
Everyone has a contribution, everybody is great.
'Good mother, Namaskar.
I'm Dr.
Surendra Mishra speaks.
I know you're coming to Magahar on 28 June.
I live in Tadawa, a small village in Gorakhpur near Magahar.
Magahar is the shrine of Kabeer.
The people here remember Kabir in the name of social harmony.
Kabeer's opinion is discussed in every corner.
Your plans will have a good effect on all the heads of the society.
I'm asking you to talk about the plans of the Central Government.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It's true that I'm coming to Magahar on the twenty-three date.
Kabirwad in Gujarat will be a well-known place.
When I was working in Gujarat, a large national conference related to the tradition of Saint Kabir was organized.
Do you know why he went to Magahar
There was a thought that those who died in Magahar wouldn't have been heaven.
Straight, those who die in Kashi will have heaven.
Magahar was considered humiliated.
But Santh Kabir didn't believe it.
He encouraged such misconceptions and blind faiths in his climate, that's why he went to Magahar and made Samadhi there.
Santh Kabir gave importance to social harmony, peace and courage, in his comrades and immorality.
That was his honor.
We see this honor in his writings.
They're so inspirational sources in today's era.
One of his dohas is Kabir Soy Peer Hi, John Jane Par Peerjo Par Peer Na Janahi, Soka Peerme Peer.
I mean, the real pure estate knows and understands the pain of others.
The man who doesn't know the pain of others is innocent.
Kabir Das gave special importance to social surrender.
He thought beyond his own time.
At that time, the world was undergoing obstacles and conflict.
He sent a message of peace and harmony.
Confirming the world mind, it has worked to remove the concepts.
Jag Mem Bairi Koi Nahim, Jo Man Sheetal Haiyah Apa Tao Dal De, Daya Kare Saba Coimata writes Kabir in a Doha, Jaham Daya Tahm Dharm High, Jaham Lobh Tahm Papjaham Krodh Tahm Hai, Jaham Akshama Tahm Ap. He said, "Jati Na Phucho Sadhu Kyi, Phuchh Leiji's Knowledge will accept the religion and religion, according to the basis of knowledge, they must be respected by the people.
His words are true even after centuries.
When we talk about Santh Kabir Das, I remember his sin.
He says: Goru Govind Dou Khade, Kake Lagum Paibilihari Guru Apne, Govinda Dio Batai.
If the guru and Govinda together, whoever I prayed for the guru, the gravitational embellishment, the guru and the Govinda.
That's how he shows the importance of the Guru.
And a guru is Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev.
He showed the way for millions of people, inspiration for centuries.
It is said that every Sikh guru represents the divine gods.
Guru Nanak Dev demon is demonstrated.
Because of Guru Nanak Dev's advice, there is great importance in the Sikh tradition for personal and social purification.
Cleanliness is important in lifestyle and practices.
Guru Nanak Dev taught him to change the caste differences in the society and see the entire humanity together.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say, "God service is served to those who do not have poverty.
He's about the beginning for the good of the community.
The kitchen was arranged without social differences.
Everyone could eat food without caste, religion, differences.
Guru Nanak Dev started launching Lungar.
In 2019, the nineteenth light of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated.
I wish we all have partners with excitement and enthusiasm.
I am supposed to admire you with the new ideas, new suggestions and new complications about how Guru Nanak Dev's nineteenth Light Parva Samaj wants to celebrate the world, and make preparations, very importantly we can celebrate the light mountain as a motivation.
Dear countrymen, India's freedom struggle was very long, extensive, deep and innumerable sacrifices.
There's a history related to Punjab.
In Jalianwala Bagh, the terrible event that embarrassed all mankind has been hundreds of years in 2019.
Who forgets the black day of April 13, 1919.
With the use of power, all the superiors of cruelty and innocent people fired at the time of innocent people.
It's been hundreds of years for this event.
Let's think of how to refresh us, and we'll remember that this incident has never sent a message to death.
With this violent and cruelty, no problem can be peaceful.
Jai and Ahimsa are for peace, sacrifice and sacrifice.
Dear people, Mr. Raman Kumar from Rohini in Delhi has been written on the Nirendramodi Mobile App, July 6.
Shyam Prasad is the birth of Mukharji.
He has written to the people about Shyam Prasad Mukherjee in this program.
Thank you very much for the first time Ramanji.
You're interested in the history of India.
Dr.
You might know that Shyam Prasad Mukherjee's remembrance is 23 June.
Dr.
Shyam Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many fields.
But he was attached to education, administration, parlmentary matters.
He was a Voice Chanselor in Calcutta University.
In 1937, after accepting the invitation of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore convention in the Bengali language of the University of Kolkata.
When the British ruled, it was the first time that somebody in the Calcutta University was speaking in the Bengali language in Convocation.
From 1947 to 1950 Dr.
Shyam Prasad Mukherjee was the first industrial minister of India.
In a way, he had a strong fight for India and industrial development.
I made a strong base, a strong stage.
In the first industrial policy of India declared in 1948, there has been a stamp of his ideas and visions.
It was his dream that India would have been vital and prosperous to gain self-employment in every field.
With the increase in big businesses in India, M.
SM.
He wanted to take care of these dresses, dresses and huts.
In 1948 and 1950, Ol India Handy Crafts Board, Ol India Handloom Board, Khadi-Wilage Industries Board were established to provide financial support and organizational facilities for the proper development of huts and small industries.
In the production of defenses of India, it is necessary to make monarchy products.
Mukharji gave the fun.
The most successful projects of Chitranjan Locomotive Works, Hindustan Aircraft, Sindhi Vehicle Corporation, Damodar Valley Corporation and the second River Valley Projects.
Shyam Prasad is among the major contributions of Mukherjee.
He was particularly interested in the development of West Bengal.
A part of Bengal has been saved as a consequence of his concepts and discretions and activity and continues to be part of India even today.
Dr.
The most important thing of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee was the integrity of India.
That's why he had to sacrifice his life at the age of only fifty.
Come on.
Let's go, Dr.
Shyamprasad Mukharji's ideal message can be remembered, with respect and adventure, he can be a partner of life for the progress of India.
Dear people, in the last few weeks, I've got a chance to talk to the government's multiple plans through video calls.
They've got a chance to know about the changes in people's lives across the files.
People talk about their complications, happiness, their achievements.
It didn't matter as much as I was concerned.
It was a different study experience.
What's going on in life a moment more than the joy in people's faces during this conversation
He was listening to a common man's story.
It was a heart-spoken story of your experience in a delicate voice.
Girls in far-flung villages provide services from pension to passport to the elderly of the village through public service centers.
A sister from Chhattisgarh has an ice cream manufacturing business with cereals.
Like the ignorant light in Jharkhand, millions of youths of the country carry medicines in the nearby villages along with medicinal centres.
A young man from West Bengal was searching for a job two-three years ago, today a business is successful.
Not only that, tenty-five people work.
In Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa, school students act in their small age in the main symptoms like smoking in the tincing lab in the school.
How many stories were there.
People didn't have any roots in the country without telling the story of their success.
In this program, the power of the country, the power of dreams about India, the power of the new India, the power of the vision of the new India, is to be seen more ordinary than the success of the government.
There are some people in the society who don't disappoint them, don't talk about failures, without trying to create unconsciousness, without finding ways to break together.
In such a situation, when the ordinary man arrives with events of ideas and new excitement and events in his life, it's not the government's scope.
Even a small girl in the small village can be inspired by a hundred and fifty people.
With the help of technology, when I spent time with consumers through video bridge, it would be very comfortable and motivated.
There's an inspiration to do something.
There's a lot of enthusiasm to do.
There is a new joy to provide life in Daridran for a poor man, a new joy.
I'm very grateful to the people.
40-50 million people are connected to this video bridge, gave me new power.
Everyone wants to express Thanks again.
Dear people, if we look around, we'll see some good things happening somewhere.
There are good people.
We can experience the fragrance of yourself.
Last day, something came to my attention, it was a very different experience.
There are professionals and engineers on one side, on the other side, our peasant brothers who work on the field.
You think it's not both different jobs.
What's the relationship between them
That's how the Corporation Professionals and ID engineers of Bangalore joined together.
They made a comfortable trust.
The trade started to double the income of the farmers.
Connected with the farmers, formulated plans and worked successfully to increase the income of the farmers.
With the teaching of new qualities of agriculture, he taught how to do biological farming.
He taught how to grow another crop with a crop in agriculture.
These professional engineers trained technologist farmers.
Earlier, the farmers depended on a crop in their farmland.
The crop wasn't good, the income wasn't good.
It's not only that they call vegetables today, but they sell it through this trust, they get a good price.
The peasants who call cereals are also here.
In a way, the farmers have a big share in the entire range of crops from production to marketing, and they are trying to ensure double profits.
We need good seeds to improve the crop.
That's why the seed bank is made.
Women are looking at this Vittubank.
So women are also connected to this.
I appreciate those young men for this different experiment.
Professionals and technocrats, engineers, who migrate out of their working territory, join the village and find out the path related to agriculture and sports.
Congratulations this very different test of the young colony of the country.
Something I know, some don't know, some know, some don't know, but millions of people constantly do some good things.
A lot of good luck for everyone.
Dear people, GST is going to be a year.
Won-Nation-Won-Tax was a dream of people, today it's really convinced.
One tax, if you want to thank anyone about the One Nation, it's with the States.
GST is an excellent example of cooperation federalism.
Together with all the states, it was decided by the kingdom.
That's why there was a huge tax evacuation in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held.
There are people in various political statistics, people from different states, people of different precautionary states, but the decisions taken so far in the GST Council are universally taken.
There were many types of taxes in the country before the GST.
According to this arrangement, only a kind of tax is available in the country.
GST is the victory of honesty, this is the celebration of honesty.
Earlier, there was a complaint of Inspector Raj related to tax in the country.
In GST, ID, Information Technology has reached the Institute.
From Ritten to Refund, everything goes on online through archives.
The GST came without checkposts.
The nuisance of commodities does not only benefit the time, but also the Logistics area, which provides a lot of benefit.
GST was probably the world's largest tax efficiency program.
In India, such a huge tax efficiency has been undertaken by the people of the country to ensure the victory of the GST through public power.
Ordinarily, in such a big country, such a large population would take 5-7 years to complete success.
But the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country and the participation of the people of the country who celebrate the truthfulness of the country, the new tax system has become a big deal within a year.
It's sustained, it's necessarily necessarily carried out sufficient operations.
This victory is the victory of hundreds of five hundred people in the country.
Dear people, once they finish Man Ki Bath, wait for the next Man Ki Ba.
To have a chance to deal with you.
Very nice.
Thank you very much.
