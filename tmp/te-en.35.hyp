Mr. Manki Bath, the Chief Minister of the Akashwani, is the favourite of my country's favourite guys, so all of you namaskaras.
Let me start this program.
This day Christians throughout the world celebrate the Eastern festival day.
Everybody during Esther's time is my salutation.
My young friend...
You all want to be uncomfortable in the tests on one side.
Some people are full of tests.
Another kind of test for some more people.
Tests on one side.
On the other hand, T20 Cricket World Cup Mach.
Even in the evening, I know that you're interested in waiting for the India-Australia match.
India has won two matches in Pakistan, Bangladesh, a few days.
We're seeing a good joke in this T20 Cricket World Cup.
Today, India is very good to play Australian sects.
These two joints are my pursuits now.
65 percent of our country's population.
We don't see any reason to stay away without combining milk in the game world.
It doesn't work to happen.
We need revolutionary changes in the sports.
We can see this place in India.
Like Cricket, there's an increasing interest in the footballs, hockey surroundings, tennis surroundings.
The FIFA Under-17 World Cup will tell you the congregation of India's hostage.
Our country has come to play twenty-five jaws from all over the world.
In 1951, the Indian football team won golden tables in the Asian Games.
And in the 1956 AC games, the Indian team stood in fourth place.
Unfortunately, in a few decades of past, we're going to get down from there to seventy-five places.
I don't mind even if you want to tell him how low our ringing is in FIFA.
Second, I'm supposed to grow so much in search of footballs in India's young age.
Give it to the English Premier's team, or not the SPANCE, or the Indian Super-Axmind match.
Indian youths are looking forward to finding fresh information about these matches, looking at them in television.
I'm saying that when the inclination of this game grows so much, the chance of giving us the FIFA Under-17 World Cup, we would only fulfil our responsibilities by placing the past.
Or, would you encourage sports by using this accident to benefit us
Football, football, football, we have to create a recurring environment this year- in schools, colleges, that speaks, every corner of the country of India.
Our youngsters, our kids must be wet with sweat while playing footballs.
That's what happens, we're supposed to be funny to give guests.
So, we all try to take football to the village village, to the street.
From now on, in 2017, the FIFA Under-17 World Cup will finish a kind of generosity in youth.
Due to the gathering of this program it has been decided that many mathematical sports arrangements are made here .
But, personally, when I'm enjoying.
Only when we could concentrate every young man in our country with this game.
Goodbye.
In 2017, the FIFA Under-17 World Cup is the best we can use for our benefits, what I want to know from you.
How should this program be
What kind of programmes should we take on the length of the length of the sufficient speed of this context
Do we need to get straightened in any other parts
How can we raise interest in India's youth towards this game by the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup
How can competition competition in government, educational institutions, social organizations be held in connection with this game
We've been watching all this place in cricket.
That's how we try to present Parshvas to other sports departments.
The FIFA program is indicating a specific chance to do this.
How well you could use this accident, send your advice, information to me
I think the FIFA program is an important part of India's setting up a brand.
I'm gonna try to identify the potential of India's young powers that can recognize the world. It's not in the sense of winning any match or Odama.
Presenting the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup, we can display them by losing power power.
Can be shown.
As soon as we do, we can also carry the branding of India's talent.
You can send me your advice regarding the 2017 FIF Under-17 World Cup, through the NAREDRAMODIAP
I'll wait for them to beat them.
Logo how to be.
How to be, Slogans.
What kind of methods to spread this whole of India
How to be, songs
Do you have any contents in Sawannir
.
Think of your friend.
And what I want.
Every young man, every young man has to dump the 2017 FFA Under-17 World Cup.
You have to take a big height in this program.
It's a golden age to build India's talent.
My dear students, you're supposed to go somewhere in the holidays.
There are very few people who go abroad.
Most of them travel within the states only in ten days.
Some visit the outskirts of their state.
In the past, I've done a nap for all of you.
Don't upload the photos of the places you saw.
I saw what work our tourism department, cultural department, state governments, or the Indian government can't do.
That work has been done by crores of travellers in the country.
What kind of magnificent places they're uploading photos.
It really enjoys seeing them so much.
We have to take this job further.
This time too do this work.
So write something on them this time.
Not just photo...
Display your authority interest.
If you go to a new place to see it, learn how much.
Any things, we can learn things in the classroom.
Which one can learn between friends in our family.
They get to learn more through roaming.
And new places will experience newness.
Humans, their language, their food habits, things are the lifestyle there.
Just one.
Erneno is available to see.
Nobody says a bird like a bird without an unexpected traveler.
If you're really interested to see, you must also establish the vision of seeing them.
The diversity of the Indian nation.
Once you get out to see, you'll be watching all your life.
You're watching.
Never end it.
I was very lucky.
I got a lot of chance to roam.
When I don't become Chief Minister, like you.
I'm stirring too many places at the age.
I may have visited the district in the country.
The journey in improving life is pursuing a powerful role.
Now in the country of India there is an increase in curiosity towards the journey of young people.
They don't want to go on the road that's ready, like everybody's going in the first day.
They want to do something new
They want to see the new ones in Kast.
I think it's a good sign.
Our young men must be brave.
Whereever the legs don't sneak, you're gonna like to lose their legs.
During this time, Kol India wants to open special honors.
Near Sawaner village near Western Coal Feel Limited (WWSL) Nagpur - there are colloquial mines - where the environment has finished the mine tourism circuit .
Ordinarily we think it's not worth seeing anymore for coughing.
If we see the paintings of the mortal worker there, we'll be surprised to find out how it's going there.
There's also a story for us.
That's the same.
The hands get blackened by hand in coughing .
That's why people go away.
But this coffee showed the tourism gracefully by Western Cool Fildes Limitted.
That's why I was very enjoying.
It started right now.
Near the Sawaner village near Nagpur, Ako Franci Man tourism site has been toured more than 10,000 people till now.
This is what gives us a chance to see a new one.
This time when you went to swimming in the holiday, you could do anything for cleaning...
There's a thing between this.
Really, there are many more occasions but let's say a consciousness on the whole.
People are trying to clean up the tourist spots.
Tourists are trying to visit that place.
They're also working for their hostages there.
This effort is not being done in a scientific way, but only work is going on.
When you go to a tourist, I believe young people in that area can be involved in this matter.
There is a lot of opportunity for treatment through tourism .
In comparison to world countries, India is very backward in the tourism sector.
But we're 125 crores of people.
So, the world can attract us.
We can make a bigger part of the world tourism ourselves.
And our crores of young people can show opportunities.
Government Ganny, organizations, Ganny, Social Ganny, people work to get it together.
Come on, let's try this direction.
Lovely my young friend, I don't like to waste a little bit to the village for the holidays.
Look at you as well.
Your holidays, time for the most important years in life.
What's going on like that
You say a thing to think.
You can communicate a new talent to your personality in the holidays.
If you don't want to swim, you can imagine to learn swimming in the holiday.
If you don't get rid of the bike, you can decide to learn a bike in the holiday.
Why don't you think I don't want to learn typing in the right way that just tie on the computer with two fingers
There are many types of skills for our personality development
Don't learn why.
Why don't you remove some of our depths
Why don't we raise some powers
Now look at a thought.
You need a lot of clauses in them, if you want the teacher, you need to find big fees, big budget.
Nothing like that.
See you around you.
You'll make it better than you're gonna decide once.
That's it.
Search some
Start preparing from them.
See-- you'll be happy.
What did you make from this crazy tree just in the evening.
You like the painting.
But don't squeeze pills.
Then, put it in the beginning.
That's the same.
You must use your holiday days to develop your personality, to gain provincial, to enhance your skills.
There are countless parts like that.
I don't want to work in the same way I said.
That skill will exist your personality.
Your self-confidence grows unless you say.
As soon as the holidays didn't go back to the school, you tell your friends when you go to college.
I learned it in the holiday.
Let's see if they didn't learn it.
That's what they think I'm ruined.
You think you're not learning.
It's natural.
So I believe you're definitely done.
Tell me what you learned.
Says Kadu.
This time www.
Mygov.
Several information has been given for 'Manki Bath' in the site.
There's one of them.
Well, Chief Minister Garu.
My name was accustomed.
I said in the last summer holidays you will also have summer warmth.
I told you to put water in Balkani, Daba Peno, and drink water.
I did the same thing.
It's so happy.
I loved a lot of kids with this sauk.
This thing is allowed to tell you again in Manki Bath.
My gratefulness to you now.
Oh, my true citizen of our country.
I'm telling you the gratitude of this little bitch.
By calling me, this boy reminded me of what I said.
To tell the truth, I've forgotten it's horrible.
And yet.
That's what I'm saying I'm not in the burren.
But, Abh remembered me.
Free I fill up a soiled plate filled with water to drink birds.
That's the complication.
Friends.
I want to thank you for Appeal Chaturvedi.
That boy called me and told me about a good job.
It's time.
That's it.
Now I remember.
I'm just suggesting you.
It's like putting water in the soiled utensils for the breasts in the summer.
Well, I knew he'd been doing this work everywhere.
Many birds also said they were friends.
Mahadevi, who became a great poet in Hindi language, loves so much for birds.
A poem stealed like this.
"I'm gonna fly away from you, we'll fill up the cover with grains.
Sweetening the water pond, filling with cold water.
"Come on, we also do the same as Mahadevi Vermaji said.
I'm telling you the pursuits of expression to remember me a very important thing.
We have brought a very terrible problem to the art of Mysore.
Milk guys come to our house, parents come.
Postman comes.
Sometimes those who sell pieces, sell clothes, go through that way.
Whenever we want them to have good water...
Did you say that
When did you give it
The craft...
You proposed so delicate.
Thank you.
You said so simple, so simple to the most important particle.
The thing is very small, but when the postman comes to our house in good sun, drink cold water.
He's so busy.
In fact, it's a matter of being self-reliant in our country.
But, sculpture...
You enjoyed me to see this thing.
My favourite brother-in-law...
You're listening to Digital India many times.
Digital India means it is the community of young people in cities, which can be their world.
It's not true.
You will be so happy to know that the app of Kisan Suvidha Op has come available for your convenience .
This farmer's well-known app, you load down in your mobile phone.
Extensive information related to agriculture, environment will be available in your own hands.
Like situations in the market...
There's no situation in Mandi.
How simple is the crop down.
What medicines are available for the field...
There are many such things in that app.
Not that much.
The button in it talks to you directly with agricultural scientists, professional experts.
They answer if you ask questions.
Tell you explained.
I hope my peasant brothers, sisters have loaded this Kisan's well-being app on their mobile phone.
Look at once.
That's what you've got to work in there.
There's no defect in it, there's less information that you can even complain to me.
My favourite brother-in-law...
The summer i . e . the holidays for all the rest.
But it's only time for the farmers to work with more sweat.
The farmer waits for the rain.
Before waiting for the rain, it gets completely busy in the work of creating its land for rain.
A drop of water also produces the land without wreaths when rains fall.
It's a very important time for farmers to start farming.
But not water, it's a matter of thinking all our citizens about what's going on.
At this time we stop flowing from our ponds, water flowing places in our area, the water reaching the ponds, the roads reaching there, or the construction of miscarriage.
Therefore the collection of water decreases regularly .
In the past, the places of water, can we clean up the shore again and make it possible to get more water and get stored
How much water can be drowned is the best.
I smelled the water in the naked water...
Fill the pond.
Our rivers, filling the cliffs, don't worry about the deficiency of water without showing rain.
We don't have much damage.
But it'll be possible only if we seize every drain of water smoke.
This time we possibly imagine five lakh water ponds.
Even under the National Rural Legislature Hami Passport (AMNRGA), the water conservation is likely to be done by Assets.
Every round, every village has to drive water.
Preserve every drop of rain during the rainy season.
Water in the village should be in the village.
Get your plans to run this fun.
Participate the government's movements.
Please put plans on how to run public orders about the importance of water resources.
Participate the government's movements.
Let's start public orders about the importance of water resources.
Everyone knows the importance of water resources...
Everyone trying to drown the water...
Let's start a funeral.
Many villages in our country, so many progressive farmers, so many aware people are still doing this.
But now it needs to be so much more effort in this direction.
Very important.
Dear brother of my farmer, sister-in-law.
Recently, the Government of India conducted a huge farmer's conference.
How much extraordinary scientific information has emerged.
I saw how many changes came in the farm sector.
But take this information up to the fields.
Now the farmers are also supposed to reduce other ears.
I'm sorry about this consequence.
Our mother's unhealthy land was born due to excessive use of rats.
We're the sons of this land, we're the child of this young mother.
How can our mother be supposed to see...
The food is tasty.
But, if that spice comes up to the dose, it'll eat the food...
Don't you think that food that we like does to the mouth
If you extract the amount of these reds it leads to destruction.
Everyone must be in concurrence.
And then the expenses are lost and the money is lost.
That's why our sympathy is very low-loaded farming .
This is the mantra to be born, follow.
We have to grow into classical methods in our agriculture.
We must take those actions with full cleverness to take action for water survival.
There's only one and two months to break the rain.
Inside this we need to preserve water.
How much water is the benefit of agriculture.
Life is so convenient.
Dear citizens of my country.
World Health Day celebrations on April 7th.
This festival of this day is organized throughout the world by the name of beat diabetes .
Open the diabetes...
Many other diseases of diabetes are encouraged to surround our body .
Many other diseases in our body are squeezed in the home of our body .
It is estimated that about six and a half crore people in our country were diabetes patients since 2014.
Three percent died due to diabetes.
Type 1, type 2 of two types of diabetes.
Type 1 comes from genetically.
My parents come to the kids.
Due to the habits of type 2 diabetes , due to age , due to obesity .
That's what we call it ourselves.
The world is worrying about diabetes diseases.
That is why this time on the World Health Day of April 7 this time the fight on diabetes has been decided to be enhanced.
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause of diabetes.
Physical work is going down.
I don't think that sweat.
It doesn't happen to be touring Auto.
The only online games to play games.
There's nothing to do in Afghanistan.
What can we do in our personal life to defeat diabetes by gaining sweat from the 7th of April
Do yoga if you want yoga.
Or at least move or procedure.
If I'm all healthy in this country, my country will also be healthy.
Sometimes we're gonna get some medical checkups.
Don't make the situation worse
Whenever I have diabetes, it comes to smell.
Tell me what's going on if you don't check.
Just do that.
Now all the facilities are available.
How light can this test be done.
You must think about this.
The 24th nerve celebrates the World Tuberculosis Day.
I knew those who were scared if I knew the name of TB.
Looks like it fell near another death.
But, now that's not afraid of TB.
Because now everyone knows that TB can be treated.
I know it's going to be a very simple treatment.
Unconsciousness has increased that the terrible people are now treated in the days they want to die.
But the number of TB patients in the world is still more.
We need to get rid of tuberculosis, that means one should be treated properly...
Two complete treatments should be done.
Caract Treatment - Complete Treatment.
There will be new problems when you leave in between.
Moreover TB is a disease i . e . surroundings, they also know the surroundings.
It's said that the tuberculosis will come to check.
Cough is coming.
Fever comes.
Weight also decreased.
They're looking at this all around.
He's called TB-VB anyway.
It means that this disease can also be tested very soon .
My favourite citizen of my country...
How much work is going on in this direction.
There are more than 13 thousand 500 microscopy centers in our country.
They're providing dot services over four lakhs.
There are many modern labouratories.
This test is also free.
You have to check once.
This disease goes away.
To get the right treatment, to continue treatment until the disease is completely cured.
But give TB, but give diabetics.
I'm just advising.
We're gonna scare these diseases.
Remove our country from these diseases.
But, you don't mind this work by government, doctors, medicines.
That's why my advice to the natives.
Open the diabetes.
Get rid of TB.
Dear citizens of my country.
There are some important occasions in April.
Especially on April 14, Baba Saheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar Jayanti.
He completed the 125th anniversary.
His birthplace in Mahav, his education in London, his Diksha in Nagpur, 26 in Delhi, his homes in Alipur Road, his funerals in Mumbai.
We are constantly trying to develop these Panch pilgrimages.
On April 14, I had the ability to visit his healthy Mahav.
Baba Saheb has inspired us so much to become an excellent citizen.
He gave me so much smile.
By turning him into a good citizen on his way, we'll be able to enjoy him in decent style.
And in a few days the Victoria Convention begins the new year.
It is celebrated in different states .
Some people call it a new year.
And some people call the shrimp, and some are the shrimps.
Something else's called up.
But, in almost all the countries of India, it has speciality.
The new surroundings are many pursuits for everyone.
You know I told you earlier too.
My "Manki Bath" is ever listening.
It can be heard in about 20 languages.
You can hear just when you can.
You can hear in your mobile phone.
So just have to call a missed.
This service has just started months ago.
But, 35 lakh people used it.
You also come to numbers.
81908-81908.
Chept this number again.
81908-81908.
You call Missed.
Whenever you can hear the old mankie bat.
You can hear in your language.
I'm so happy to be together with you.
My favourite citizen of my country...
You're purified before my heart.
Thank you a lot.
.
