Manki Bath, New Year 2016, my dear countrymen, Namaskar.
In the last month we were celebrating Diwali.
Like every year, on the occasion of Deepawali, once again I went to our border with China to celebrate Deepawali with the Jawans.
I.

Deepavali celebrated at the heights of the Himalayas with soldiers and soldiers.
Every time you go, but this time the experience was different.
Twenty-twenty-five people in the country dedicated this Deepawali to the soldiers of the army.
It was reflected on the faces of all the soldiers.
It was a very surprising reaction that the natives enjoyed the security forces in their joy.
People didn't mess with the message, but they were compelling with them.
Some wrote poems, some pictures, some cartoons, some made videos.
That's how many houses turned into military posts.
I'm surprised to see how imaginary and vision is when I see these letters.
My guav thought that some species were chosen to make a handicap.
It works with all your cooperation.
With all your partnership, your imaginations about the country's army and the security forces will be prepared by giving you the whole vision.
A young man wrote to me, the main man, all the festivals like Holly, Deepawali for the soldiers.
Every moment, the country's security can be finished.
Yet there will be a reflection of the house at the festival.
But the truth doesn't happen this time.
It's a celebration. There was no thought at home.
We were also persuaded to celebrate Deepawali with hundreds of five hundred Indians.
My dear patriots, between our security forces, this Deepawali should have a feeling in this environment only in such special occasions
As a society, as a nation, we have to make a habit and make a habit.
We must remember the soldiers of our country in some way, even if the festival is very pleasant.
When the entire nation stands with the soldiers, the strength of the army increases 125 million.
A few days ago, the princes of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir came to see.
They were five people of the Conferens, Jammu and Kashmir.
Kashmir was from every village till the valley.
There were about 40-50.
I got a chance to talk to them for a while.
They came with some of their village development requirements.
But the situation, the law and order, the future of the children, was very natural when the talk started.
Lovely, the villagers spoke with open mind...
Everything was touching my heart.
In the middle of the conversation, the school burnt in Kashmir has passed.
The villagers had the pain we all had...
They said school wasn't the future of the children.
I requested you to go and pay attention to the future of those children.
I'm very happy to have fulfilled the promise given to me all those village leaders who came from the Kashmir Valley.
They went to the village and made the far-flung people awake.
About 95 percent of the students of Kashmir participated in the examination when the board was tested a few days ago.
Many children participated in the board exams show that our children in Jammu and Kashmir have observed the new heights of development for a bright future, through education.
I appreciate them for their enthusiasm.
At the same time, their parents and relatives and their teachers and all the village leaders celebrate their hearts.
Dear sister brothers, when I invited the instructions for Man Kee Bath this time, there was a lot of suggestions.
Everyone had to say extensively about 500,000 notes.
On 8th November 8th night, when we talked about the nation, it was said that an important move to bring changes into the country began.
It was said that this decision was not a simple decision and it was filled with difficulties.
It must be done as important as it is.
I thought we had to face many kinds of problems in our normal life.
I told you that it would take 50 days to get out of the effect of this decision.
I told you to return to the normal state after 50 days.
Whatever disease we have been suffering for 70 years, the solution to escape from that disease will not be simple.
I understand your problems.
But when a lot of attempts are made to mislead you, sometimes the events that take your mind, when you see your support and co-operation, you understand that you have taken the right place in the country.
500 and 1000 notes, so big country, so many companies, millions of notes and these decisions are taking care of the world.
All economic experts are appreciating it.
Twenty-twenty-five people in India are trying to win with difficulties.
There may be a question mark in front of the world.
Hundreds of thousands of people in India are respected.
I believe this decision will win.
Our country will change like gold.
That's the citizens here, you're somebody, you're gonna make this way out of victory.
In the country, central governments and state governments, all the components of local territorial institutions, one lakh 30,000 bank branches, lakhs of bankers, more than one and a half lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank portraits are in this regard.
He's working with a surprising surrender.
During many kinds of mental conflicts, they were very calm and considered it as a patriotism, as an effort to make a great change.
Starting in the morning, working without knowing when the night is over.
That's why it seems clear that India will win in this ashram.
The officers of the bank and the post office are working in such a situation.
They seem to be two steps ahead of humanity.
There was an accident in Khamdwa
Suddenly the need for money came.
It was very pleased to know that when a bank official noticed, he himself went to the house of the accused and brought the money to the need for treatment.
Innumerable stories like this are known everyday by TV, media and newspapers.
I'm grateful to all these friends who work in this great yagna, who give men's meaning.
When the challenge is straightforward, the power is recognized.
I remember that when the Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana's work was done, the bankers took it as their own responsibility and didn't work in 70 years.
Their comfort appears.
Now, once more, they've taken a challenge.
I believe that the vision of the hundred and fifty million Indians, the effort of eachbody's mind, will lead this nation into a new power.
Even today, some people are unable to mislead the misery.
Some people still feel that the money of corruption, this money, this non-calculated money, this financial money is going to be brought back to the economy.
They're looking for unlawful ways in trying to keep their money.
The most sad thing they choose is the way they use poverty.
They're trying to save the plot by putting money on their accounts, or they're trying to do something else.
Today, I have to tell them that you do not want to repeat or regulate, do not follow the law and do what you like.
But please don't play with poor lives.
My dear people don't work hard on your sin when the poor's name comes in the papers.
The law of the implementation of the Binami estate is very difficult.
The government doesn't want to trouble the countrymen.
Mr. Ashish was praised by telephoneing the war against Rs 500,000 from Madhya Pradesh.
He said: Sir Namasteh, my name is Ashish Pare.
Madhya Pradesh is from Tharali village of Taluk in Harda district.
It's very congratulating to prohibit 500 thousand rupees notes.
People are uncomfortable, but the examples related to welcome this supreme revolt of the nation, Man Key Battle.
There will be enthusiasm for people, the economy is very important for nation building.
I'm with the country.
It's very happy to retract the notes of thousands of thousands.
A phone like this, Mr. Karnataka.
Yelpa got from Velankar - Modiji, Namastey, I speak to Yelpa Velankar from Kopal village of Kopal district of Karnataka.
Thank you for your heart.
Because, when Daddy Ayenge said nobody thought he would make such a big retreat.
Thousands of notes retracted and taught a good lesson to the accusers and corrupt.
All the Indian priests don't have a good day.
Thank you so much for your heart.
Some things are encouraged by media, people to know through ways related to government.
It's very happy to see that the common people in my country have a wonderful ability.
There is a restaurant at National Highway 6 in Akola, Maharashtra, where a large board is installed.
"If you have an old look in your hands, you don't worry about money, leave your food here without hungry.
Whenever there's a chance to go through this way, you must pay.
"People're leaving here
He's eating.
After 2-4 days, it's gonna be paid.
This is my country's strength, service, artistic influence, and faith.
During the election, a program was organized by Chai Pa Churcha.
It knows the world.
People from many countries of the world learn to say tea pa church.
But I didn't know that there was a wedding in Chai Pay Church.
I knew there was a wedding with Chai Pa Churcha in Surat on November 17th.
In Gujarat, a girl gave her tea to her daughter.
There was no procession, there was no food programs, because the money was slightly troubled by the withdrawal of notes.
The companions of the dragon accepted it with respect.
It is inspired by Surat's Bharat Maru and Dasha Parmar that he shared his great role in this war against the conspiracy against corruption through his marriage.
I am humble for the newlywhelming Lord and Person.
Marriage is also part of a great pride like this, so many congratulations to change the opportunity.
People find better ways in a tragedy.
I was late tonight watching TV news.
There is a small village named Dhakiajuli in Assam.
There are workers in the tea garden.
They're gonna get millions of money for weeks.
What did they do when they got a notice of 2000
There are four women in the neighborhood.
Four of them together and bought things and paid a note of 2,000 rupees.
They didn't need small notes.
Because all four of them bought things.
I decided to look at it next week.
People are finding their ways.
You see this change.
The people of Assam's tea gardens have received a message calling the ATM.
You see how the village life changes.
Some people were quickly benefited in this movement.
The country is going to get the benefit in the coming days.
But some gained quickly.
Some calculations were asked, and we got some information in small towns when we were busy.
It is reported from nearly 40-50 cities that because the notes were withdrawn they had to take out all the remaining forms.
Many of them had to shut down the charge of water and electricity.
The habit of the poor will be closed for two days.
Great people with relationships, who don't want to ask you, they don't pay properly.
Their drunkards will be very left.
If all the municipalities came to be 50 percent of the debt.
But this time, on the 8th date, everyone ran away to close all their old notes.
Last year in 47 cities, it was 3,500 million beats.
If you hear it, it'll be surprising and joy, this week it's got ten thousand crores of rupees.
Where's the fifteen thousand-two tribes, where's the fifteen thousand crores.
That's also straight and closed.
In those municipalities, the swords and slums are naturally closed in the slums of the poor.
There will be arrangements for water, arrangement for Anganwadi.
There will be many examples like this to see its direct effect.
Brother brothers, our villages, our farmers are the strength of the economy of this country.
Because of this new change in economic system on one side, all citizens are fighting with it.
But today I want to appreciate the farmers of this country.
I was calculating the farm dishes.
Though wheat, peacocks, oil pepper, it has been a lot of years compared to the last year in terms of the date of November 20.
During difficulties, the farmers are searching through.
The government has taken several decisions.
In which the farmers and the villages have advanced.
Yet there's trouble.
With all our difficulties, natural difficulties, they still stand firm.
Small businessmen in our country are employing and enhancing financial purchasing.
We took a major decision on the last budget.
Like the big palaces, small businessmen in villages can trade 24 hours now, there are no legal obstacles.
Because why don't you get the poor shopkeeper of the village 24 hours when the big malls get older
There is a progress that takes the loan to them in the Modra plan.
According to the print plan, millions of rupees have been given to small people like this, because millions of people do these small businesses, lead to trade of crores of rupees.
But it was natural for them to be troubled by this decision.
But now our small businessmen serve consumers by technologies, mobile apps, mobile banking, credit cards and their methods.
There are businesses on the basis of faith.
I would like to tell these small businessmen that you too have the chance to enter the digital world.
You also have to download the banks on the mobile phone.
Please put the POS machine to use credit cards.
You can also learn how to do business without notice.
Great malls can increase their business with technology and a technologically easier to use a small businessman.
There's no problem, it's a chance to grow business.
You'll be able to give you a big contribution to an unnoticed society.
I'm sorry for you.
In order to increase your business, you can bring the entire banking facility to the mobile phone.
There's a lot of ways to do business today.
It's the way technology is safe, it can be quick.
Help me to win this move.
Not just this, take charge of change.
I know you can take responsibility for change.
I'm sure you can put this technology in the entire business of your village.
I'd like to tell the labour brothers.
You've done a lot of cheating.
There was another one in the seal.
Perhaps you'll get the whole of the money, and you'll have to share it outside.
Workers considered this hypocrisy to be a part of their lives.
This new system enjoys that you want to have an account in the bank, and the compliance is to be deposited in your bank.
There will be obligations regarding low bloodshed.
You have to get all the money without reducing it.
You don't have to cheat.
If you get the money in your bank account, you can do business on a small mobile phone.
I don't need a big smart phone.
Now the mobile phone can recommend e-pers.
You can buy whatever you want from the nearby small shops through that mobile phone, and you can pay the money.
That's why I specially request to join the workers' brother-in-laws in this scheme.
Because I took such a big decision for poor, peasants, laborers, unemployed people and sufferers.
They have to get the benefit.
Today I want to say something special to the youth.
65 percent of the people are younger than 35 years of age.
You know, young men in my country liked my decision.
I know you support this decision.
I know that you're very part of this thing in a very beneficial way.
Friends, you're my real soldiers, my good friends.
We have an amazing chance to serve motherhood, this is the opportunity to take the country to the economic well-being.
My youth, can you help me
It's not enough to stay with me.
Your experience of the new world will not be an old generation.
Your family doesn't know the jewelry, your parents, your daddy, your uncle, your uncle.
You know what the app is, the online banking knows how online ticket booking is.
It's all normal for you, you use it.
But today the country wants to do a great deal of uninterrupted society.
Well, it's not a society that can't be a hundred.
But we can't change as a slightly neutral society
If you start a little bit of community planning once, the uninterrupted society will not be far away.
You need your direct help in this, your time needs your vision.
I believe you will never disappoint me.
Because we want to change the lives of the poor in India.
You know what's going on for the digital banking or the mobile banking today.
All banks are providing online facilities.
All the banks in India have mobile apples.
All banks have their own valets.
Wallat means e-Pers.
There are many types of cards available.
There are millions of poor families in India in the form of the Jandhana project.
The use of Rupee card, which was used very little, was 300 times after the eighth day.
Prepaid card is available to spend money from the bank like a prepaid card on the mobile phone.
UPI is another big head of business.
With that you can buy things, pay, buy money.
It's simple as you send a message to the Watts app.
Even those who didn't learn to send the Watts app tonight, I know forwards.
Not just this, it's simplifying technology as it doesn't need a big smart phone.
The money can be sent even by using a normal phone.
The seller who sells the newspaper, but the seller of tea, but the seller of the sea, can use it comfortably.
I switched out to make these arrangements more simple.
All banks are trying to do it.
Now the online surcharge has been run.
Other expenses like this have been recorded in the last two days newspaper.
It's trying to strengthen the movement of the unnoticed society.
My young friends, but all this is a big generation.
I'm sure you're all working on this great thing.
I've seen all the creative messages you give in the Watts App... poems, poems, short stories, cartoons, new complications, sports.
Besides all the challenges, we see the creative ability of our young colony and sometimes Geeta was in the battlefield, it seems that when we pass through the time of great change, we have a self-creative ability.
But my dear young friends, I tell you again, I need your help in this.
Yes, yes.
Yes, yes.
Yes, yes.
I repeat, I need your help.
I believe you, millions of young men in my country will do this.
You do something, decide yourself to be part of the unnoticed society.
Your mobile phone will have all the communications for online expenses.
Not just this, every day half an hour, an hour, at least ten families, about two hours, teach how to use this technique, how to do the bank's app download.
Teach how to spend the money in your account, how to give it to the shopkeeper.
Teach the shopkeeper how to trade.
You must take the lead in the journey to free the country from corruption, to liberate people from troubles and troubles, in the journey to free the country from corruption.
If you teach people how to use the Rupee card, the poor will embarrass you.
If they teach the ordinary people all this, they'll probably get rid of all kinds of people.
I don't think if all the youths in India are engaged in this matter, it'll take a long time.
Within a month we can present a new India in front of the world.
You can do this by your mobile phone and go to ten homes a day and connect ten houses every day.
I'm sorry, come on.
Not only support, but we can become the army of this change and relax the change.
We'll take this war ahead of the country's corruption and conspiracy.
There are many countries in the world that have changed youths.
We have to admit that the revolution is bringing changes.
Kenya decided to make a mobile plan in the name of MPESA, using technology - named MPESA.
Today, all businesses in Kenya of Africa are ready to change.
The country has done a revolution.
My dear young men, I once again pray for you to take this initiative forward.
All schools, colleges, universities, encycles, enssas, I promise to do this together.
Let's take this forward.
We have a chance to serve the country.
You shouldn't lose this chance.
Dear sister brothers, a great poet of our country, Mr.
The birthday of Harivansharai Bachanji.
Today, on the birthday of Harivamsharai Bach.
Amitabh Bachchan has given a philosophy to the purifying program.
You'll see, the most famous artist of this century, Amitabha purifying Yajna, leads very heartfully.
It seems that his man is spreading in pureness.
That's why he remembered his father's birth anniversary as well.
He wrote a verse of a poem from Harivansharai Ji, "Mon body, full of joy, compassionate life, that's me.
" (Miti Ka Man, Masti Ka Man, Christian husband, survivors) purifying in the veins of his son Mr. Amitabhji flows like blood.
With the poem of Harivansh Raiji, he wrote to me: A clean body, a clean mind, a clean India, that's me.
Harivansharai ji is honored.
Mr.
Mr. Amitabh Bachchan expresses his gratitude to be such a partner in Man Key Bay and promote purifying pureness.
My dear countrymen, now I'm constantly connected with your thoughts of Man Kee Bath, through your letters and My Gave and Narendramodi Ape with your views.
This mankie bat runs at 11 o'clock.
Let's listen to the local languages after this.
I'm gratitude to the sky when they start a new one.
People who don't have Hindi languages get a chance to get connected to it.
Thank you very much for them.
