The voice of the mind - 27.
8.
17 folks, honourable values.
On one side, the country is covered, on the other hand, when there is a news about the conflicts between any corner of India, it's a natural matter of concern in the country.
This is our country , Buddha and Gandhi .
For many centuries, our fronts have been filled with this in our minds, for the usual marketing life, for the ahims, and for the ahims.
Ahimsa Paramodaram: - We've come here to tell us, we've been listening to this little one.
I've also told the Red Fort that we can't communicate with the name of faith.
It's a religious belief, a political ideology, a belief on a person, a discipline-conditional confidence - nobody has the right to take law in the name of faith.
Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambetter has given us the political constitution.
Everyone has created all kinds of structures in them as soon as possible.
I would like to believe the people who take the law into their own hands, follow the coordination paths - they're personal, being a socialist, whoever they are, this country cannot afford it any government will not be able to see it.
In any case, they must be headless before the law, be answered to the law, the law will decide, the law will certainly be punished by those who have committed misdeeds.
My folks, folks.
Our country is full of confusion.
This rationality is not seen in food habits, dresses, dresses.
This confrontation is seen in every activity of life.
Whatever it is, it is filled up in our traditions, the fifteen thousand years old traditions, we see our cultural traditional, social traditional, historical possibilities, in the 365 days of the year, a day without any comment.
You've seen that all our plans are being set up in the nature code.
And all this is connected directly to the nature.
Many of our plans are related to farmers, fishermen.
If I'm talking about your plans today, you all want to say Michamee sadness.
Jains celebrated Samvatsari fair in the last days .
Festivals are celebrated in the month of Batra .
On the last day of the festivals, Samvatsari comes.
It's a wonderful tradition in itself.
On the day of Samvatsari, refers to the humor, achimsa, nandapu.
It's a kind of sorry words that speak tranquil.
On this day, it's a matter of telling someone a mischief.
Even in our materials, , that's why the humble warriors are called treasures.
Who has the ability to forgive, they're warriors.
Even Gandhians, repeatedly mention the specialty of the powerful man.
Do you know what Shakesbir wrote about the quality of salvation in the Merchant of Venice, his play
Mercy is twice blest, it blessetth that gifts and him that takes, that's the funny, sneakers - both are the dressors of God's humor.
My folk folks, if all the corners of the country are celebrated somewhere as a square square sweetheart.
When the Grandfather speaks about the square, it's a natural thing to talk about the festival celebrated in the society.
This tradition was made 125 years ago by Logamanya Dilkar, the Bird Sanctuary.
For the past 125 years, before independence, it has been describing the freedom struggle, and after independence, it has also become the subject of social education, social awareness.
Grandfather square dress is celebrated for 10 days .
This is considered to be a symbol of time, abnormality, equality, satisfaction.
For all the folks, the male square lives.
Now the festival of comfort is celebrated in Kerala .
In the colorful pavilions of India the tourism of Kerala becomes the first instance .
This is known for the social, cultural significance of the day.
At the time of Oran festival the whole of Kerala 's cultural heritage also shows light .
During this time, the community spreads the news of sensitivity, and people raise a new enthusiasm, new neighbourhood, a new hope.
Nowadays our plans are the factors of attraction, tourism.
I would like to tell the folk people about the development of modernity in Gujarat , the festival of Durga in Bengal , which is a kind of tourism attraction .
Our other plans have also made foreign nations an opportunity to attract.
In this direction we have to imagine what else we can do.
It's going to be here for a few more days in this festival.
All the people of the country live for Italy suha.
Conceptions are the factors that make us believe, disappointment.
In the same way, in the new India, the plans should be a pure factor.
In the family life, the festivals and sanctities are also connected.
It's just to pay attention to the purity of the honour.
If it's not a new thing all of us, it's essential that it's a social natural change.
Ordinarily, how should our purifying eyes be, satisfaction is not only in our homes, but in all our cities, in all our states, it must be transformed into a joint organ of our country.
A condition that changes me being modern, folks.
Nowadays there has been a new sequence, a new level - even though you are so citizen, how modern it is to know how modern your sympathy is now used, that it is how you are awake about environment.
Looks like you're acting naturally in the environment, not the environment.
If you're acting against the environment, you'll be considered bad.
I see the effects of this mirror change - in the square square roots of the Grandfather idols of nature , the result of a big movement .
If you saw you going to the U tube, you can see the children of the house roasting from the outside, creating the idols of the kid.
They pour colors, someone blossoms vegetables, someone puts a piece of paper in it.
Several types of projects are done by every family.
The biggest exercise of environmental awareness in a way has been found in this genesis for the first time.
Communications also train people in creating familiar idols, encouraging, guiding, creating familiar figures in large quantities.
Look how big it has changed.
Our country is a country full of millions of intelligence.
I'm enjoying your mind, when you're supposed to be new.
The dragon is specially accumulated by a soil, a mixture by which people have been trained to create a male idol, and in a small edge, the idol of the kid is swallowed, putting it in the water immediately passes away.
And he didn't stop, and Tulsich planted one of them.
We started purifying three years ago, three years have been completed on the 2nd day of October.
Its creative effects come out.
There are only 39 percent to 67 percent of the rest households .
More than 2 lakh 30,000 villages have been declared free from the habit of excreting in the open.
In the past days there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
The guys died, but after the flood was flooded, it was the same skull.
In such a situation, in the Banaskanda district of Gujarat (Tanera), residents of Jamiyat Ulema A Hindu composition, 22 temples suffering from flood and 3 mosques have been cleaned.
You worked, everyone engaged in it.
A special example of satisfaction, synthesis, is not enjoying anybody, but it is a sympathy, Jamiyat Ulema, who lives in the Hindu fashion.
If the efforts of the sacred supremacy, the effort to imagine, change our sustainable nature, we can't afford any shrink to our country
My folks, I'm gonna have a choice for all of you - from 15-20 days before the date of 2 October of Gandhi Jayanti, a kind of campaign called 'Silence Service'.
The whole country can create a climate of sanitation.
When we get the chance, we'll find out where we get the chance.
But in it we all need to be integrated.
It's a kind of product before Deepavali, that we believe that the production of Durga Puja was produced before Navaratri.
Get your physical service.
In the holidays, in the early days of Sunday, we'll work together.
Go to the surrounding towns, go to nearby villages, but we can do all this in a drive.
I have followed all the government structures, schools, colleges, social colleges, government officials, district rulers, Panchayat leaders, Gandhians born every day on October 2, 15 days before the day of birth, we will have a circumstance of sanitation, which should be actually an October 2 dream of Gandhians.
Drinking water and sanitation, MyGov.
There's a portion in.
After setting up the toilet, your name, toilet can be booked in the name of someone you helped.
My social friends can finish some creative operations, and you can predict you as ensuring jobs in the conflict.
Conceptual competitors will be conducted by the determination of pessimism, success in sanctification.
Competitions, competitiveness, painting, etc. are organized by the Drinking Water and Sanitation Development Committee.
You can write books in many languages, there's no age.
You can make a coincidence, make it in your cellbase.
2-3 minutes can be made synchronized, it must be a hygiene.
In any language, there may be no living.
The best three compositions will be selected for the participants.
The crowns will be selected in the district level
Likewise, awards will be given to the shrine in the state.
I'll invite all of you that you all agree with this sacred act.
This way we have to celebrate Gandhiji's birthday on the 2nd day of October, purely October 2, for which the month of September starts 15th, we must include this mantra called 'Stuise Service' at home.
We have to try something for the sake of sanitation.
We can get partialized in it, by working.
If you do this then you will see how Gandhiji will shine on the date of October 2 , the birthday of the birthday .
When we celebrate the 2nd day of October, after the 15th day of the sanitation of the sacred service, see how pure joy will be available in the sights we have given to deserted Gandhians.
My folks, I want to tell you my thanks to all of you today.
I want to show you my thanks from the deepest of my mind.
Not only this, but you've been bringing your mind together for a long time, but I'm trying to see my thanks to see lakhs of people connected to me every corner of the country through the voice program.
If there are many lakhs of people participating in the cheeks of the mind , those who listen to it are in crores .
Lacs of letters are written, reports, many people are sending messages through phones, it's a big joy on me.
This is the biggest opportunity to understand the minds of the folks.
More than what amount you're waiting for for the horse of the mind, I'm waiting for the news you're giving.
I'm thirsty, because you're giving me the opportunity to learn every thing.
It's the conversation I'm talking about the activity.
See many things in a new sequence, you're also helpful to share small things with me, so I'm showing my favorites to all of you for this partition, and I'm thankful to you, and you have to see things, listen, learn, understand, all my efforts are.
This phone calls you can feel sorry.
Yeah, we're doing this kind of fault.
Sometimes some things don't even talk to us that we're wrong if we change the amount of ourselves.
They're the Prime Minister, I'm speaking from Pune to Aparna.
I'd like to talk to you about my dog
She's always trying to help everyone, but she's making me a move.
Once I went to the business premises to buy things with her.
Buying a butterfly spent Rs 2000 without paying any fault, then he spent 450 rupees and bought Beetsa.
But with the auto driver used to come to the premises, he was very busy at a price of 5 rupees.
While buying vegetables on the way back, the fee for each vegetable was mixed 4-5 rupees.
I'm very hard.
We're buying things without asking any questions at large places, fighting for money from our sisters who work hard.
They're sorry about them.
"You must say it in your mind's hole."
After asking for this phone call, I'm sure you might be surprised, why don't you finish the hate, you might have made sure that I'm not going to walk like this.
Whether we're selling things in our house, having small shops, vegetable shopkeepers, sometimes there are auto drivers... or you're not interested in this price, you're talking about two rupees, you're less than five rupees.
We don't even notice what we're writing in the rope when we eat food in big restaurants.
I'm gonna give you the money.
Not only this, if we buy worms in big shops, we don't even have any addresses.
In the same way, we can't be in a hurry, without talking to the bus.
Have you ever seen what's going on in that creepy mind
The question is not about 2 rupees, 5 rupees.
His heart wounds that you've been humiliated on his coin, because he's crazy.
2 Rupees, 5 rupees, everything doesn't make any changes in your life, but how big pain will you have in the mind of that treachery
Madam, I'm gonna swear to you, you're delivering a message through a phone call that touches your mind.
I believe the folks and the folks will surely handle the habit of speaking with their luxury.
My young friends , on the 29th of August , the whole country celebrates all the games everyday .
This is Hawky sports valor, Major Tyan Chand, who is considered to be a majestician in the world of Hawky.
Hawky's unaware of his participant.
That's why I remember this thing that our country's younger community should join you with games.
Sports should turn into the organ of our life.
We're gonna have to compete with these young sports fields, because the youngest country in the world.
The sports of hygiene , rigid mentality , hostility etc . tell them what else .
Sports are kind of a favour to connect minds.
I'd like to say that our country's younger guys should emerge in the game world, that's more important than today's computer world, playground, computer sports equipment.
FIFA can play all in the computer, but I'm gonna see the calibration in the field.
You can play cricket in the computer, but play under the wind in the field, the joy of that.
Sometimes when the kids all went out at home, the mother heard when she came back.
Nowadays, how it has changed, when children come home, sitting in one corner, start watching cartoon pictures or get covered in mobile camps.
Mothers have to tear to see them when you go out and play.
It's the time of the time, when the mothers asked you to come back home,
My son, this time you have to listen to your mother's son that you'll go out and play outside.
Small friends, sports teachers, sports capabilities, and smooth Sports Tallent Search Portal, and portals looking for sports capabilities.
Here in the field of sports, if any child in the country, is capable of them, they can give you details or videos about yourself in this port.
The elected, growing sportsmen, training the Sports Minister, is the beginning of this port tomorrow.
In India, from 6th to 28th October, FIFA has been organised for the World Calcutta Crown for 17 years of age.
24 dresses from all over the world are playing in India.
Come to the small community residents coming from many countries to come through sports.
Let's experience the sports, make such an environment in the country.
If you talk about sports, there was a possibility of touching my mind in the past weeks, I'd like to comfort you about it.
I got the chance to meet young ladies, some of them were born in the Himalayas.
They won't see the seas in their lives.
Six such women work on the trunk.
Their feelings, their inclination, are enjoying us all.
These 6 women's gatherings are also busy traveling in a small boating INS TARINI, trying to cross the seas.
Navika Sagar Purkrama, the name given for this process, is the seashore of female malmis.
They'll turn back to India after spending months around the world.
Sometimes you spend only 40 days of water.
Sometimes you have to spend only 30 days continuously in the water.
Between the waves of the ocean, our six females travel with luxury, this is the first time in the world.
It's only for any drunken dweller in the country.
I'm listening to these women's feelings, I'm asking them to take your experiences away from the people of the country.
We've made a way out of their experiences in the Narendramodi app, you're planning to study.
You must read it, because it's a kind of fabricated story, self-concerned story, I'm very happy to share the experiences of this woman's gain with you.
Live my heart for these ladies, lovely good wishes.
My folks, on the 5th of September, we celebrate teacher's day.
The former President of our country, Dr.
It's his birthday.
Even though he was president of the state, he predicted himself an architect throughout his life.
He always wanted to live an architect.
He was with a sense of devotion in education.
A lawyer, a monarchy, was the president of the President of India, and every penny he lived in a life-style.
I remember him.
Famous scientist Albert Einstein once said : It is the true experiment and knowledge of the teacher in the teacher of the Supreme Cart . Its meaning is an important quality of an editor .
This way, if we celebrate teacher's day, we're gonna make a decision together
Can we run a drive by targeting one
Teach to Transform, Educate to Empower, Learn to Lead - Let's give authority extensive education, lead education.
Can't we take this thing forward with this sure
Everyone composes with some surety for five years, show a way to reach it, that level they reach in five years, feel the joy of success in life - this kind of environment should be our schools, colleges, our teachers, our educational institutions, when we talk about changes in the country, how do you remember the mother in the family, the teachers come to memorize as a community.
The teacher has a great role in making changes.
Because of his efforts, the events that were successful in changing his life will certainly be in every teacher's life.
If we try socially, we can change ourselves in the country, we can get the biggest participant.
Come on, let's go ahead with this mantra, learn to see the change.
"He's the Prime Minister.
My name is Da.
Anonymous labour.
I'm staying in Mumbai city, working for the Indian Research Centre of Howard University.
As a researcher, financial inclusion, that is, I have special interest in social plans related to economic clearance.
I'd like to ask you the question that you started your plan in 2014.
In today's three years of age, whether India is more secure than the economy, whether the power increases, the concessions, the facilities, our women, the farmers, the workers, the villages, the villages, all the way out, tell me what the data is.
Thank you."
My folks have heard about "Pradesh Mantra Jan."
Regional clearance: It is not only in India but also from the objective of economic world scholars.
On the 28th of August of 2014, I started this plan with a dream in my heart.
With the 28th day of August, this Prime Minister John has started his plan, which has been completed for 3 years.
30 million new families are connected to it, bank deposits are opened.
It's more than many countries of the world than mucked population.
Today, I am supposed to be the biggest thing that, within 3 years, my poor brother, who is under the community, joins the main waterfalls of the economic structure of the country, whose habit has changed, he starts coming to the bank, starts collecting money, starts feeling the security of money.
In some cases, if the money slipped in hand, if it was in the bag, it was in the house, it would be encouraged to spend the sweat.
He's also beginning to feel that the money is profitable for the children's expenses, now has been built in a finished environment.
It starts thinking that this money will be helpful for some good work in the future.
Not just this, when a fool sees the Rupay layer in his bag, thinks he's a vanguard.
They're the corpse in the bags, thinking that there is a Rupay corpse in me, feeling the pride of self.
Prime Minister Jan through his plan, the money deposited in the bank by our harvests is 6,5,000 crores.
In a way this confession of harvests, it will be their strength in future.
The Prime Minister, John, who opens the bank's debt through his plan, gets the benefit of the copies.
Prime Minister Jews Jodi's co-operation, Prime Minister's Department of Conflict Cooperation Scheme - A very easy fee of Rs. 30, today is a new belief in the lives of those hardships.
In many families, due to this one rupee fee, if there is a confrontation, the family's head will die, the family gets 2 lakh rupees.
Prime Minister Mutra Yojana, Startup Plan, Stand Up Plan - In these , tribes , tribes , women , celebrities , young men who slaughter in their own legs , such crores of young people as Prime Minister Mutra Yojana , without any kind of bondage from the bank, have been provided.
They're not only in their own legs but also in the successful attempts to work for one or two people.
In the past, some people of the bank department, when they came to meet me, said a study about how good people have been benefitted by Jane's plans, cooperative plans, Rupay cards, Prime Minister Mutra plans, etc.
It's not too late today, but such things are definitely myGov.
I'm asking the bank employees that I'm gonna lay down in the gallery.
People will read it and enjoy it.
How a plan makes a change in the lives of a person, how new energy fills, which creates a new hope, is kept in front of me.
Bring them to your vision, I'll carry out all the efforts.
People of publicity also have the potential to fully use them.
They're also looking forward to such people, can make new predictions for the new prediction.
My folks, once again the Michame for all of you.
Thank you very much.
.
