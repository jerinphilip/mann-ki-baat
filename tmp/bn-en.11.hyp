My favourite countrymen, Namaskar, March, 2017
Today's 'Ramnavami'.
In this sacred day of Ramnavmi, I'm very happy to know the countrymen
The greatness of Ramanama in the life of worshipper Bapuji, we have seen it at every moment of his life.
On January 26, the representatives of the countries of the Asian clan came here and brought together various cultural groups.
It is very proud that most of the countries set up 'Ramana' in front of us.
That is, not only in India, but also the inspiration and influence of Ram and Ramayan in the Asian clan countries of this land.
I'm telling you all the glad news of Ramnamy once more
My dear countrymen, like every time I received a lot of letters, e-mails, phone calls and opinions from you.
I read what I wrote in the mygov about the launch of the 'Online Course' of Komal Chukkar Sanskrit.
I'm very nice to see your feelings about Sanskrit as a familiar worker.
I told the Department of Congress to give you information about this.
I'm also requesting them to think about how this proposal of Komal Chukkar can be taken forward.
Shri Ghanshyam Kumar of Barakar village of Nalanda district of Bihar has received the opinion of 'Narendramodi Ape'.
It's really important that the concern you have expressed in the geologically low water level.
Sri Shakal Shastri of Karnataka wrote in a very beautiful language, "Ayushman Bharat" is possible only when there will be a land of humans.
And the 'Ayushman Land' can only be when we take care of every animal living in this land.
You've requested to keep water arrangements for animals in the summer.
Shakal-ji, you don't think I've reached all the listener friends.
Mr. Yogesh Bhadresha's statement, I would like to say something in the health of the young people this time.
According to him, young people of our country are physically weak compared to other Asian countries.
Yogesh-ji, I thought I'd talk to everyone about health now, "Fit I
I'm gonna talk about "ndia", and the newborns like you are "Fit I"
Andia can take the work list forward.
A few days ago, the honorable president of France went to Kashi.
Shri Pacific Kumar of Varanasi wrote, all the scenes of that journey touched his heart, inspired him.
He showed interest that all those pictures, videos should be broadcast in the social media.
Pacific ji, the Indian government shared all the pictures in the Sosal Media and the Norendramodi App.
You're gonna lick them, re-tweet and spread them in your known palace.
The Gratitude Cards that have been given at the end of the book "Ekjam Warrior" from Chennai and jaysh and many children have sent them to me in writing what they think.
All the kids like a jaysh want to say that when all these letters are sent to them, my whole day's drift, hard work is very funny.
All these letters, so many phone calls, opinions, all that I read, and all of these things that I have touched my heart.
If I'm just talking about them, I guess, I'm gonna have to talk about it all the month.
Most of these letters have been received from the children.
They wrote about their tests, shared vacation plans, thinking about animals and birds in this summer.
Farmers' brothers and sisters sent letters to me about the activity that is going on throughout the country with 'Kishan Mela' and farming.
Some conscious citizens have advised me about water supply.
Since we're broadcasting this popular festival through the skyscrapers, I've been aiming, there are more letters about this summer and summer complex.
Before the test, I'm getting a tired letter from the examiner friends.
There's a lot of letters about our many festivals, our culture and traditions.
I mean, this "Man Walt" is changing immediately with the change of monsoon, if this "Man What Walt" is changing the lives of anybody.
Besides, it will not change or why, in the ceiling of this letter sent to you, your feelings, your inspiration, your people's language, and that's the obligation to your land.
And all this thought is the power of the country's valuable change.
When I read letters sent to you, I can know that Ahmed Ali, a Rexachalak from Karimganj in Assam, filled with his will and built nine schools for poor children, then this country can be identified with immense will.
When I heard Kanpur's doctor, Ajit Mohammad Mohammad Sadhej, who used to treat the physicians of the footpath and gave them abundant medicines, he was proud of the compassion and humanity of the country.
Calcutta Taxichalk Seedul Laskar's sister died due to lack of timely treatment.
Sydol took oaths at the hospital, so that no poor people die due to lack of treatment.
For this pledge, Saidol discovered the pride of his house, collected donations from John to man, and taxi climbers also financially helped him.
An engineer's young man gave Sadul to his first mine.
Thus, by collecting the meaning of sesame twelve years, it was possible to build a thirty-wheeler hospital in Punri village in the upper part of Calcutta.
That's the New I
The person of 'Ndia'.
When a woman in Uttar Pradesh fought her fight, she tried to build a hundred and fifty toilets, the other women in the neighborhood are also very excited.
This is the light of new motherhood.
That's how many inspirations are involved in my country.
Today, the whole world sees India in another eye.
Today, when the name of India is highly respected, then the satisfaction of the children and saints of this country hides behind it.
Today, in all the communities of the country, women, backward men, poor and middle classes, this belief was born that yes, we can move forward on the path of progress.
My country can move forward in progress.
Today, there has been a positive atmosphere of self-confidence full of hope.
This self-confidence, this predictive psychology 'New I
The Sankalp of the Ndia will realize, the dream will be meaningful.
My dear countrymen, for the next few months farmers will become very important for their brothers and sisters.
Because there's a lot of letters related to farming.
This time I saw the video of the event that I discussed with the farmers friends in the DD Kishan channel of Doordarshan, and I think this DD Kishan channel of Doordars should be seen by all the farmers.
So farming suggestions should be used in their own fields.
If Mahatma Gandhi's word is true, or the Shastriji, whether Lohiaji or Charan Singh or Siddhist Devi Lal Ji, everyone considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of this country and an important part of life.
Mahatma Gandhi's feelings about soil, fields and farmers' brothers were very bright in his speech.
He said, "To forget how to dig the earth and to tend the soil, is to forget ourselves" means to attract the world and take care of death, if we forget, it will be like forgetting ourselves.
Sri Lal Bahadur always gave importance to the conservation of sacrificial trees, plants, forests etc. and the need for improved agricultural practice.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had spoken of the Sarvik public awareness for our farmers to ensure better productivity, improved settlement and all these matters and to increase food and milk production.
In 1979, Christian Charan Singh urged the farmers to use and explore new technology in his speech, emphasized its need.
I went to the farming fair organized in Delhi a few days ago.
I'm talking to farmers and scientists there.
Know many agricultural experiences, understanding, knowing about the new discovery of agriculture, all this was a joyful feeling for me, but the thing that affected me most is the farmers of Meghalaya's labor.
This kingdom of low land has done a great job.
Our cloudy farmers produced records in the last five years in the year 2015-16.
They've shown that if the target is stable, there is complete confidence, there is a promise in mind, then it's possible.
Today, technologies have been combined with the workers' hard work.
The agricultural producers have a lot of power.
I saw the letters that came to me, many farmer friends wrote about MSP and they wanted me to discuss this with them.
Brothers and sisters, this year's budget has taken a big decision to pay the farmers the cost of the crop.
It's fixed that MSP for fixed crops, at least one and a half times of luggage.
If I tell you extensively, the luggage for MSP will be done, the other workers who work hard and work, their labor, the cost of household animals, the cost of machines, the cost of animals, the cost of seeds, all types of costs, the cost of sets, the state government's royalty, if the land is taken on the basis, then their fare.
And not only this, the farmer who works on himself, if any of his family works in agriculture, his price will also be added to the products.
Besides, there is a detailed work on the 'Agricultural Marketing Reform' in the country for the farmers to pay the cost of the crop.
The local market in the village, the Pikari Bazar, which is connected to the world market, is trying.
Farmers will be upgraded to APMC and DE-NAM Platform with the necessary circuits of twenty thousand rural houses of the country to sell their products so that they don't go far.
That means, such arrangements are being made to connect with any market in the country from a specific field.
My dear patriot, E-year Mahatma Gandhi's Sardhasan Year celebrations are going on.
It's a historic moment.
How will the country celebrate this festival
"Clear India" is our skepticism, how can 125 crore countrymen call Gandhiji the best admirer of this
Can you create a new program
Can you think of a new way
You're requested to share your thoughts with everyone through mygov.
What could be the Logo of "Gandhi 150"
What Slogan could be, tell me what you're suggesting about.
We'll all together organize a memorable reverence of Bapooji, and take our country to the peak of development with inspiration from Bapooji.
(Phone) Namsker, honorable Prime Minister
I'm calling Preeti Chaturvedi from Gurgaon.
You made the 'Swachh Bharat' campaign a successful mission.
It's time now that we're gonna make the 'sick India' campaign the same way.
Tell us something about how people, government, institutions are jealous for this mission, thank you
Thank you
You're right.
I believe that both 'Swachh Bharat' and 'Sool India' are supplementary to each other.
In the health of today, the country has left behind the popular method of conventional expression.
All the work related to health was in charge of the Health Minister.
Now all the departments and spellmen, whether they are clean chanters or mantras, chemists and serpents or consumer spells, women and childbirth spells or various state governments are working together for 'Good India'.
There is also a lot of emphasis on 'Afordable Health' along with 'Preventive Health'.
Preventive Health Care is cheap and simple.
We're aware of the pre-entive Health Care, it'll be beneficial for all individuals, family and society.
The first condition of keeping life healthy is cleanness.
We're all bound to do this.
Consequently, in the last four years, the 'Swaching Campaign' has been doubled by 80 percent of the work.
Besides, there is a lot of work to build the Health Welfare Center across the country.
Yoga as 'Preventive Health Care' has created a new identity in the world.
Yoga promises to be both healthy and capable.
It was the result of our obligation that Yoga was formed today as a coalition movement and reached home.
This year 'International Yoga Day' is 21st June and 100 days is not left.
In the last three 'International Yoga Days' everywhere in the country and abroad all the people participated with great enthusiasm.
Now, we have to ensure that we will join ourselves and encourage family members to join everyone.
In the form of new and integral, children, young and adults, men or women, you have to popularize yoga.
The country's TV and Electronic Media are performing different programs.
But from now on to 'Yoga Day', can you create awareness about yoga as an expedition
My dear countrymen, I'm not a teacher of Yogasan, but I'm "Yogavyasi".
Some people have made me a teacher of Yogasan through their own thoughts.
And my Yogavas has created an animated video.
I want to share this video with you so that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Increase health services, everybody's evening, cheap and accessible for the people.
Today, more than three thousand people's medicine centers have been opened in the entire country, where more than 800 drugs have been sold at low prices.
The new center is opening.
My request to the audience of the "Man Ki Vaat" program, reach the people's drug center, their costs will be very low.
They'll be very useful.
Heart Stent's price has been reduced to 85 percent for heart patients.
The cost of artificial knee has also been reduced to 50 to 70.
Under the 'Ayushman Bharat' scheme, about 10 crore families, that is, for the treatment of nearly 50 crore people, the expenditure of 5 lakh rupees in one year will be taken by the Government of India and the Beema Company.
The MBBS of the present 479 medical college of the country has increased to about 68 thousand.
New AI in different states to get better treatment and health care for the citizens of the whole country.
I
MSL is being set up.
A new medical college will be opened in every three districts.
In the year 2025, the country was targeted to free the tuberculosis.
It's a tough job.
Everyone needs your help to reach this consciousness.
We all have to try together to get rid of the tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Amedkar on 14th April.
Many years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambadkar spoke of artillery in India.
In his thinking, the artistry is such a powerful medium, which will result in the supply of poorest human income from the country's poverty.
Today, when the 'Make in India' project is going on with success all over the country, that dreamer is our inspiration.
India's position in the world is like a bright star.
The most foreign investment is the FDI
It's happening in India.
The worldwide is now looking at India.
Because we're becoming the center of investment and new innovation.
Dr. Ambassador felt that this joy of industrialization would rise from the city.
And that's why he was particularly dependent on the country's city.
The 'Smart City Mission' and 'Araban Mission' project in the country has been started by defeating his dream.
My dear citizens, the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Amedkar, April 14th.
Many years ago, Dr. Ambedkar spoke of India's artillery.
In his thinking, the Artsman is a powerful medium, which will lead to poor human income from the country's poverty.
Dr. Ambedkar dreamed: India would once be a powerful center of workshop.
Today, when the Macinindia project is going on with success all over the country, its dream vision is our inspiration.
India's position in World Grade is like a bright star, and the most foreign investment is FDI.
It's happening in India.
The world is now looking at India because we are now becoming the center of investment and new tradition.
This joyer of industrialization would rise from the city, Dr. Amvedikar and hence trusted the citizenship of the country.
This dream of his dream has begun in the country 'Smart City Mission' and City Plan.
Not only big cities, today, efforts are being made to bring small people of the country under all modern opportunities: clear drinking water, health and education, digital connections, etc.
Dr. Amedak was deeply faithful in self-reliance and self-reliance.
Even a man in the country is not living in poverty, like this, Dr. Ambedicor.
The poverty that cannot be trampled by the donations of the poor also believed in it.
Today projects like 'Mudra Yojana ' , ' Start-up India ' , ' Stand-up India ' are creating youth and youth in our country .
During the decades of 1930 and 1940, when only the roads, highways and rail discharges were planned, Dr. Ambedkar said to build the port and waterways.
Babasaheb thought of a hypocrisy of power and power of the Centre.
The country will grow when the water will be used properly.
Like him, the visionary people said at the same time, the rivers and the valleys are supposed to be supposed to be.
I imagined that there will be several working committees for water surroundings and use.
Today, the historical activity of waterways and ports has started in the country.
The construction of new ports and old ports is also being built on different seashores of India.
In the 1940s, when the world's second world, the cold war between the two powers and the tension of the territory, Dr. Ambadkar imagined the 'Team India' or the spirit of India.
He understood the importance of Federalism or Matriculation and so thought that for the development of the country, the Center and the States must work together.
Today, we have been convinced by the United States of cooperative U.S. or Cooperative Federalism at every level of the country and the United States with a comprehensive counterpart cooperation.
The most important thing is, Dr. Ambedkar's inspiration to a number of people like me in the sect behind the country.
He is the specimen of a poor family that can realize his dream.
Once Dr. Ambadkar had to hear the light, he's taken a lot of coolness.
Perhaps trying to do many times, so that a poor family could succeed in life.
But "New I"
The Koran of the Nedia is quite different: this is an Indian year of Amedakara, a poor man who lies behind.
Surrounded by Dr. Ambedkar's birth anniversary, the 'Gram Swaraj Mission' is being organized throughout the country on 14th April from 5th May.
This campaign will be organized in the country, a variety of programmes of rural, poverty and social justice.
My request for yourself is to take part in this national campaign.
My dear countrymen, in a few days, many celebrations are coming: Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Estar and Vaishakhi.
Let the Mahavir celebrate the sacrifice and penance of Lord Mahavira.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavira, the propagator of Ahingsa, is inspired by us.
I'm telling all the patriots to celebrate Mahavir Jayanti.
Yes, Jesus Christ, who wanted to listen to the peace of humanity, the goodness, the righteousness, the mercy and the sacrifice.
In the month of April, the festival of Vaishakhi will be run away from Panjab and western India, at that time in Bihar, Judshital and Satwin, Bihu in Assam and Payla Vaishakh in West Bengal.
All these obsessions are somehow connected with our agriculture and grains.
Through these festivals, we thank nature for the priceless gifts found in the form of crops.
Once again, I'll give you all the good news of all the events
Thank you very much
.
