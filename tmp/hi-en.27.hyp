Talking to the mind, November 2016, my dear countrymen, Namaskar
Last month we were all enjoying Diwali .
Like every year this time on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went on the border of China, to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers
I
TBP jawans, army personnel - with them all celebrate Diwali in the Himalayan heights
I go every time, but this Diwali experience was something else
In the unique style of the country's hundreds of millions of countrymen dedicated to the soldiers of the Diwali army, dedicated to the security forces, its effect was expressed on the faces of every soldier there .
They looked full of emotions and not only this, the countrymen who sent good wishes and messages included the security forces of the country in their happiness, was a wonderful response
And people sent messages, not so, they were connected to the mind
Someone wrote poems, someone made pictures, someone made cartoons, someone made videos, that is, every house had become a post like fighters
And whenever I saw these letters, I was also surprising how many imaginations are, how many emotions are filled and MyGov thought of taking out some select things and making a Loe Table Book
Work is going on, with all your contribution, the feelings of the soldiers of the country's army will be compiled in this book, with all your imagination, your emotion towards the security forces of the country.
A soldier's army wrote to me - Prime Minister ji, we are on Holi, Diwali for the soldiers, every festival is on the border, every time they are immersed in the protection of the country
Yes, yet at the time of festivals, the house is remembered
But tell the truth, this time it did not look like
It didn ' t happen that there was a festival and I am not home .
It felt as if we were celebrating Diwali with millions of Indians
My dear countrymen, who realize this Diwali, the feeling that is between the security forces of our country, among the soldiers, should they be limited only on some occasions
I appoint you that we, as a society, make your nature, make our nature
Any festival, festival, an atmosphere of happiness, we must remember the soldiers of our country in some form
When the whole nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases 125 million times
Some time ago I had come to meet all the heads of the village from Jammu and Kashmir .
These were the people of Jammu-Kashmir Panchayat Conference
We had come from different villages from the Kashmir Valley .
There were about 40-50 principals
I had a chance to talk to him for a while .
They came with some things about the development of their village, came with some demands, but when the talk was going on, it was natural, the situation of the valley, the law system, the future of the children, it was very natural to get out of all these things
And with so much love, with so much openness, these heads of the village talked, everything was going to touch my heart
In the talk, the schools which were burnt in Kashmir were discussed and I saw that as much as we suffer from the countrymen, these heads also suffered so much and they also believed that not the school, the future of the children has been burnt
I urged him to focus on the future of these children .
Today, I am happy that all these leaders who came from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise given to me.
He awakened all the remote people in the village .
Just a few days ago when Board's Yeam happened, the sons and daughters of Kashmir possibly took part in the examination of the Board, 95, students of Pachnabe Fishdi Kashmir.
In the Board examinations of such a large number of students, it points out that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are determined to achieve new heights of development for the bright future.
For this enthusiasm, I congratulate the students, but congratulate their parents, their families, their teachers and all the village heads with great heart
Dear brothers and sisters, this time when I asked people's suggestions for "mind", I can say that everyone's suggestions are one-sided"
Everyone used to say that talk more on 500-and 1000 notes in detail
By the way, on November 8, at 8 pm, addressing the name of the nation, I had discussed the introduction of a Mahabhiyan to improve the country.
Even when I made this decision, I had presented before you, I had said in front of everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties
But as important as the decision is to implement that decision
And I was also guessing that a variety of new difficulties would be faced in our normal life .
And yet I said that the decision is so big, it will take 50 days to get out of its influence.
And then we ' ll be able to move to the normal state
The campaign of liberation from diseases that we have been suffering for 70 years can not be easy .
I can understand your difficulties well
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation
Even though many attempts are being made to confuse you, despite the incidents that sometimes distract the mind, you have understood this path of truth well, you have accepted this fact of the country.
Five hundred notes and so many big countries, so many billions of currency notes and these decisions - the whole world is very closely watching, every economist is doing it very analysis, is evaluating
The whole world is seeing that even hundreds of millions of Indian nationals will achieve success by facing difficulties .
Maybe there may be question marks in the mind of the world
India is only revered to the hundreds of millions of Indian nationals, believe that hundreds of millions of countrymen will continue to fulfill their resolve.
And our country, like gold, will come out in every way, and its cause is citizen of this country, the reason for which you are, the path of this success has also been possible due to you
All the units of central government, state government, local Swaraj institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than one and a half lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank-friends - day and night are engaged in this work, dedicated are engaged.
In the midst of tension, all these people are very peacefully working by treating it as a sacrifice of the country and the service, as an attempt to make a great change.
Start in the morning, when the night will be completed, you do not even know, but all are
And that is why India will succeed in it, it is clearly visible
And I've seen that all the people of the post office are working in the midst of such difficulties
And when the point of humanity comes, they see two steps ahead
Someone told me that a person in Khandwa became accident .
Suddenly money was needed .
There came to the attention of the employee of the local bank and I was happy to know that they went to their home, that elderly, so that they could get help in treatment
Innumerable stories come out in the conversation every day in T . . . . , media , newspapers .
I thank all these companions who work in this great prince
The identity of power happens when they cross the criterion
I remember equally when the campaign of Jan Dhan Yojana was going on by the Prime Minister and the way the employees of the bank raised it on their shoulders and what was not done in 70 years, they did it.
His strength was introduced .
Today, once again, he has taken that challenge and I am confident that the resolution of hundreds of millions of countrymen, the collective selfishness of all, will paving this nation as a new force
But the evils are so spread that even today some people have no habit of evil .
Still some people feel that these money of corruption, these black money, these unaccounted money, these anonymous money, find some way and bring it back to the system
They're looking for illegal ways to save their money
Sadly , even in this they prefer to choose the way to use the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by misleading poor, talking about greed or temptation, by putting money in their accounts or by doing any work to them
I want to say to such people today - improving, not improving your will, following laws, not doing your will, what will he see
But, please don't play with the lives of the poor
Do not do anything that the name of the poor will come on record and later when you are checked, my dear poor get into trouble due to your sin
And there is such a harsh law of anonymity, which is being implemented in it, how much trouble will come
And the Government does not want our countrymen to have any difficulty .
A war that has been fought against corruption and black money through this five hundred and thousand of Madhya Pradesh has praised me: - Sar Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare
I am a common citizen of village Tirali, Tehsil Tirali, District Harda, Madhya Pradesh
It is very commendable that the currency notes of thousands and five hundred have been closed by you
I want to tell people many examples in the matter of mind that despite being tolerated by the people, they have welcomed this hard step for nation's advancement, from which people will be encouraged in a way and the cashless system is very important for nation building and I am with the whole country and I am very happy that you closed thousands of hundred notes
Just like this, I have come from a phone from Sriman Yelappa Velankar ji of Karnataka: - Modiji Namaste, I am talking to Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal District of Karnataka
I want to thank you, because you said that good days will come, but no one thought you would raise such a big step
Five hundred and thousand notes, seeing all this, taught a lesson to black money and corrupt people
Every citizen of India will never have good days .
That ' s why I want to thank you .
Some things through media, through people, through government sources, the enthusiasm of working increases too much
It is so happy, so proud that what is the wonderful power of the common man in my country
National Highway N-6 in Akola of Maharashtra is there a restaurant .
He has put a big bord that if you have old notes in your pocket and you want to eat, do not worry about money, do not go hungry from here, go to eat food and then once you come to pass through this path, then you must give money to go
And people go there, eat food and after 2-4-6 days when they pass there again, then return the money again
This is the strength of my country, which also has service, sacrifice and authenticity.
I used to discuss tea in the election and it had reached the world .
People from many countries of the world learnt to speak the words on tea .
But I don't know that tea is discussed, marriage is also done
I came to know that on 17th November in Surat, there was a marriage that happened with discussion on tea
In Gujarat, a daughter who came here in Surat, got tea and did not do any water, no food program, nothing - because there was some difficulty due to the ban on money
The Baratis considered him so respectful .
Bharat Maru and Deksha Parmar of Surat - They have contributed to corruption through their marriage, against black money, the fight that is going on, it is inspiring in itself
I also give blessings to newly married Bharat and Daksha and also congratulate the occasion of marriage in this great sacrifice and give a lot of congratulations to revert it in a new occasion .
And when such a crisis comes, people also find ways better
I once saw in TV news, night came late, so I was watching
There is a small village in Assam .
Tea-workers live and Tea-worker get money weekly
Now got a note of 2000 rupees, what did they do
The women of four neighbors gathered and the four went together and paid a note of 2000 rupees, they did not need a small currency, because the four together bought and decided that they would meet the next week, then we will sit down and we will count it
People are looking for their own way
And look at the change
The government has a message, people of Tea Garden of Assam are saying that we have an ATM
See how the life of the village is also changing
Some people have got immediate benefit from this campaign
The country will get the benefit in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefits
Asked a little calculation, what happened, I found a little information about the small towns there
About 40-50 cities, which I got information that due to the closure of this note, people did not pay the money, not the water ta, not the electricity, and you did not give the money and you know well - The poor people used to go 2 days ago to pay the pie-pai squared
These are big people, not those who reach, who know that they are never going to ask anyone, they do not pay the same money
And sufficiently owed to it
Each municipality is hardly 50 of the ta
But this time , because of the 8th decision , all the people ran to deposit their old notes .
In 47 urban units last year, at least three-and-a-half-year-old rupees came to the ta.
You will be surprised to know, pleasure will also be - in this one week they have deposited 13 thousand crore rupees
Said three and a half thousand and said 13 thousand
And that too came from the front .
Now if these money comes 4 times in those municipalities, it is natural, there will be gutter arrangements in poor settlements, water will be arranged, Anganwadi will be arranged.
There are many examples in which its direct benefit is also visible .
Bhaiyo-Bahno, our village, our farmers are a strong axis of our country's economy
On one hand, due to this new change of economy, among the difficulties, every citizen is adjust himself
But I want to specially congratulate the farmers of my country today
Now I was taking the figures of this crop sowing
I am happy, whether it is wheat, pulses, whether oilseeds
By the 20th of November, I had an account, sowing has increased in sufficient quantity compared to last year.
In the midst of difficulties, the farmer has searched the way
The government has also made several important decisions, in which farmers have given priority to other villages
There are difficulties even after that, but I believe that the farmer who is suffering from all our difficulties, natural difficulties, still stands stunned, at this time he is still standing
Small traders of our country, they also employ, increase economic activity
In the previous budget, we had made an important decision that small shopkeepers of the village like big mall can now do business for twenty four hours, no law will stop them
Because I thought, if the big mall gets 24 hours, why should not the poor shopkeeper of the village be found
From money plan to give them lots of initiatives
Millions of crores of rupees gave money to such small people because they do small business, millions of people and speed up the trade of billions of rupees.
But due to this decision , it was natural for them to be difficult .
But I have seen that now our small businessmen are also serving customers through technology, through mobile app, through mobile bank, through credit card, on the basis of trust
And I want to tell my little businessman brothers that there is a chance, you also enter the digital world
You also have to download banks on your mobile phone
You also have PSL machines for credit cards
Learn how you can trade without a note
You see, the way you increase your business through large mall technology, a small businessman can also increase his business with this normal user friendly technology
There is no question of deteriorating, there is an opportunity to increase
I invite you that you can contribute a lot to making cashless society, you can build a full banking system on your business, mobile phone and today there are many ways except notes, so that we can run business
There are texchnological paths, sae, secure and uick
I would like you to help just succeed this campaign, not so, you also lead change and I believe you can lead change
You can work on the whole village business on the basis of texchnology, I believe
I
I want to tell the lazy brothers and sisters too, you have been very exploited
There is a pagger on the paper and when it is given in hand, then it's another
Sometimes the salary gets complete, then someone stands out, he has to cut and the labor force makes this exploitation a part of life
With this new arrangement, we want your bank to have an account, your salary money should be deposited in your bank so that Minimum Wags are followed
You get the full money, don't do any cut
Don ' t exploit you
And once you get money in your bank account, you can also pay money on a small mobile phone - no big smart phone, nowadays your mobile phone also works e-batuway - you can buy whatever you want to buy in the small shop from the same mobile phone.
That's why I urge the lazy brothers and sisters to become partners in this scheme, because finally so big I decided for the poor of the country, for the farmer, for the deprived, for the victim, his benefit should be met
Today , I want to talk to young friends .
We say in the world that India is a country with 65 people, below 35 years of age
You young and young men of my country, I know, my decision has come to you
I also know that you support this decision
I also know that you also contribute a lot to pursue this point positively
But friends, you're my true soldier, you're my true companion
A wonderful opportunity to serve Ma Bharati has come to us, there has been an opportunity to take the country to economic heights
My young men, can you help me
Give me a hand, so much talk is not going to happen
As much as you have the experience of today's world, the old generation is not
Maybe the elder brother in your family will not even know and parents, uncle and uncle, maternal uncle will probably not know
You know what happens to App, what happens, Conline Banking, know how Conline Ticket Booking happens, you know
Things are very common for you and you use it
But today is our dream of the great work that country wants to do
It is okay that hundreds of cashless society is not possible .
But why not India launches Less-Cash society
Once we start the less-cash society today, the cashless society will not be far away
And I need your physical help in it, the time of God, the will of God
And you will never disappoint me, I believe, because we are all people who want to change the poor life of India
You know how many opportunities are for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking today
Every bank provides online facility
Every bank in India has its own mobile app
Every bank has its own wallet
Wallet's straightforward means e-batuwa
Many types of cards are available
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have Rupayard and after 8th, the Rupay Card which was used very little, the poor started using Rupay Card and almost 300 has increased .
As there comes prepaid card in mobile phone, there is also a prepaid card to spend money in banks
There's a good platform, PIC to do business
By which you can buy, you can send money, you can also take money
And these works are so simple as you send the WhatsApp
Nothing will be a read-written person, how to send him to WhatsApp today, he comes, How to Forward, comes
Not only this, Technology is becoming so simple that there is no big smart phone for this work
The simple feature phone can also be a cash transer
Dhobi, vegetable seller, seller of milk, seller of newspaper, seller of tea, seller of gram, everyone can use it comfortably
And I ' ve also made this system more simplified
All the banks are engaged on this, doing it
And now we used to spend this online surgery too, that too cancel
In the last 2-4 days, you must have seen the expenditure of this type of card and so on, all the expenses were executed in newspapers so that the cashless society's movement was strengthened.
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation that is unfamiliar with it
And all of you, I know well, are active in this great work
The kind of creative message you give on WhatsApp - slogan, poems, stories, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter and joke - everything I see and between the challenges, this young generation which is the creation power of our youth, it seems as if this is the feature of the land that the song was born in the battlefield, just as we are passing through such a big change today, then you are also getting original creative.
But my dear young friends, I once again say, I need your help in this work
G-G-G, I repeat, I need your help and you, you believe me, millions of young people of my country will do this work
You do a job, from today you will be a part of yourself for cashless society
The more texchnology is to spend on your mobile phone, all that exists
Not only this, every day half an hour, an hour, two hours and at least 10 families, how do you use this tachnology, how do your banks app download
How can money be spent in your account
How can the shopkeeper be given
Teach the shopkeeper how to trade
You voluntarily get this cashless society out of the rounds of these notes, campaign to free the country from corruption, campaign to get rid of black money, campaign to free people from difficulties and problems - You have to lead it
Once you use people Rupay Card, you will teach them, then poor will bless you
If you teach these systems to the general citizen, then he will probably get rid of all the concerns and if all the young people of India get this work, I do not believe it will take longer
Within a month we can stand in the world as a new modern Hindustan and you can do this through your mobile phone, you can go to 10 homes everyday, add 10 homes to it
I invite you - Come, not just support, we will be a fighter of this change and will continue with change
We will carry forward this fight to free the country from corruption and black money and there are many countries in the world, where the youth have changed the life of that nation and this will have to be accepted, the change that brings, revolutionizes, it makes youth
Kenya, she picked up, M-PSA created such a mobile system, used Technology, named M-PSA and today the entire business in Kenya has been preparing to shit on this area.
This country has a great revolution .
My young men, I once again, once again ask you to proceed this campaign
Every school, collage, university, N, NSS, collectively, personally, I invite you to do this work
We move this thing forward
We have the opportunity to serve the best of the country, not to lose the opportunity
Dear brother-in-law, a great poet of our country - Shriman Harivansh Rai Bachchan ji is the day of birth-jyanti today and today on the birthday of Harivansh Rai ji, Shriman Amitabh Bachchan has given a slogan for ' Swachhta Abhiyan ' .
You must have seen, Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this century, is pursuing the campaign of cleanliness very much.
It seems that the subject of cleanliness has spread in his vein and only then he remembered the work of cleanliness even on his father's birth anniversary.
He has written that Harivansh Rai ji has a poem and one of his lines he has written "Mitty's body, the mind of fun, life for a moment, my introduction"
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce himself through I .
"Mitty's body, fun of fun, life for a moment, my introduction, his son, Shreeman Amitabh ji, whose rugs are running cleanliness, has sent me to write using the poem of Harivansh Rai - "Clean mind, clean India, my introduction"
I bow down to Harivansh Rai .
Mr . Amitabh also thanks Amitabhji for joining the mind in this way and pursuing the work of cleanliness .
My dear countrymen, now your thoughts, your emotions, through your letters, on myGov, keep me constantly adding you to NarendramodiApp
Now at 11 o'clock, it is a matter of "mind", but in regional languages it is going to start immediately after completing it"
I'm grateful to the AIR, these new ones who I
nitified, so that where Hindi language is not popular, my countrymen will definitely get an opportunity to join it
Thank you very much for all
.
