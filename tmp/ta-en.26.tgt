Mann Ki Baat, December 2016 My fellow countrymen, Namaskar, many felicitations and season’s greetings to you on the occasion of Christmas.
Today is the day to give importance in our lives to service, sacrifice and compassion.
Jesus had said - “The poor do not need our favours but our acceptance with affection.
” In the Gospel According to Saint Luke, it is written that – “Jesus not only served the poor but also praised the service done by the poor,” and this is what real empowerment is.
A tale associated with this incident is also very popular.
It has been mentioned in that story that Jesus was standing near the treasury of a temple;
many rich people came and donated bountifully;
then a poor widow came and parted with only two copper coins.
Now just two copper coins really do not amount to much.
Thus it was natural that there was a lot of curiosity in the minds of the disciples gathered there.
Then, Jesus declared that the widow was the greatest of those donors because while the others had donated substantially, that widow had given away all she possessed.
Today, 25th December, is also the birth anniversary of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviyaji, who kindled resolve and self confidence in the psyche of the Indian people and gave a new direction to modern education.
My most sincere and heartfelt tributes to Malviyaji on his birth anniversary.
About two days ago, I had the opportunity to launch many a developmental work in Banaras, the sacred workplace of Malviyaji.
I also laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre in BHU at Varanasi.
This Cancer Centre is going to be a boon for the people of not only eastern Uttar Pradesh but for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar also.
Today is also the birthday of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Venerable Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji.
This country can never forget Atalji’s contributions.
Under his leadership, the country proudly grew in stature in the field of nuclear power also.
Whether in the role of a party leader, Member of Parliament, a minister or the Prime Minister, Atalji always established an ideal.
I salute Atalji on his birthday and pray to God for his good health.
As a party worker I had the privilege of working with Atalji.
Many memories emerge before my eyes.
This morning when I tweeted, I shared a video, in which you can see for yourself how as a small party worker one had the fortune of having affection showered upon him by Atalji.
Today, on Christmas Day, as a gift the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes.
In a way it is the beginning of two new schemes.
Throughout the entire country, be it villages or towns, the educated or the illiterate, there is an atmosphere of curiosity as to what is cashless, how cashless business can take place, how can one make purchases without using cash!
Everybody wants to understand and learn from each other.
To encourage this trend, to strengthen mobile banking and to inculcate the habit of making e-payments, the Government of India is launching from today encouragement schemes for consumers as well as traders.
To encourage customers, the scheme is ‘Lucky Grahak Yojana’ and to encourage traders the scheme is ‘Digi Dhan Vyapaar Yojana’.
Today, on 25th December, as a Christmas gift, fifteen thousand people will get rewards through a draw system, whereby each of the fifteen thousand winners will have one thousand rupees into their accounts and this will be not for today only;
starting today this scheme will continue for the next 100 days.
Everyday fifteen thousand people are going to receive rewards of one thousand rupees each.
In the next 100 days, lakhs of families are going to receive crores of rupees as gift, but you will be entitled to this gift only if you make use of mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay Card, UPI, USSD - such means and methods of digital payment.
The draw for rewards will be done based on your use of such digital payment methods.
In addition, there would be a grand draw once every week for such customers in which the prize money will be in lakhs of rupees and three months later on April 14th, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar, there would be a mega bumper draw where rewards would be in crores of rupees.
‘Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana’ is mainly for traders and businessmen.
Traders should adopt this scheme themselves and should encourage their customers too in order to make their business cashless.
Such traders will also be rewarded separately and there would be thousands of these rewards.
The traders will run their business activities smoothly and will also have an opportunity to win rewards.
This scheme has been designed keeping all sections of society in mind, with a special focus on the poor and the lower middle class segments.
Therefore only those will get its benefits who make a purchase worth more than 50 rupees but less than three thousand rupees.
Those who make purchases of more than three thousand rupees will not be entitled to rewards under this scheme.
Even the poor people can use USSD on simple feature or ordinary mobile phones to buy and sell goods as well as make payments and thus all of them can also become prospective beneficiaries of this reward scheme.
In rural areas too, people can buy or sell through AEPS and they can also win rewards.
Many will be surprised to know that now there are about 30 Crore, i.
e.
300 million RuPay Cards in India, out of which 200 million RuPay Cards belong to poor families which have ‘Jan Dhan’ accounts.
These 300 million people can immediately become part of this rewards scheme.
I have confidence that the countrymen will evince interest in this system and if you enquire from the young people around you, they would surely be aware of these things and on your asking will tell you about these.
Come on, if there is a child studying in 10th or 12th standard in your family, he or she will also be able to teach you well about this.
It is as simple as sending WhatsApp messages on the mobile.
My dear countrymen, I feel delighted to learn that the awareness about how to use technology, making e-payments, making online payments is spreading very fast.
During the past few days, the cashless transactions, or cashless trading has increased by 200 to 300%.
To give cashless trading a big impetus, Government of India has taken a very major decision.
The business community, our traders can well comprehend how momentous this decision is.
Those businessmen who adopt digital transactions, who develop online payment process instead of cash transactions in their trade activities will get Income Tax rebate.
I congratulate all the states and union territories, who have promoted this campaign in their own way.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Mr.
Chandrababu Naidu is the head of a committee which is considering various schemes under this.
However, I have seen that the governments also have initiated and implemented many schemes.
I’ve been told that Assam Government has decided to grant a 10% discount on property tax and business license fee if payments are made through digital transaction.
The branches of Grameen, that is, Rural Banks there getting 75% of their customers to make at least two digital transactions between January and March will get 50 thousands rupees rewards from the government.
They have announced that under the ‘Uttam Panchayat for Digi-Transaction’, rewards of 5 lakh rupees will be given to villages doing 100% digital transaction till 31st March, 2017.
Assam Government has decided to reward 5 thousand rupees to the first 10 farmers as ‘Digital Krishak Shiromani’, who will buy seeds and fertilizers entirely through digital payments.
I congratulate Assam Government and also all those state governments who have taken such initiatives.
A number of organisations have also successfully carried out many experiments to promote digital transactions amongst the rural folk and poor farmers.
I have been told that GNFC or Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited, which primarily manufactures fertilizers, has installed a thousand PoS machines for sale of fertilizers for the convenience of farmers and in just a few days 35 thousand farmers were sold 5 lakh sacs of fertilizers on digital payment and this was accomplished in only two weeks!
And the interesting fact is that compared to last year the fertilizer sales of GNFC have gone up by 27 percent.
Brothers and sisters, the informal sector occupies a major segment in our economy and in our pattern of life and mostly these people are paid wages for their labour and hard work in cash.
They are paid their salaries in cash and we know that due to this, they are exploited also.
If they are to receive 100 rupees, they get only 80 rupees, if they are to be paid 80 rupees, they are given only 50 rupees.
They are deprived of facilities like insurance and those associated with health sector.
But now the practice of cashless payment is being adopted;
the money is being directly deposited into banks.
In a way, the informal sector is getting converted into the formal sector, exploitation is coming to an end, the cut, which had to be paid earlier, has stopped now and it has become possible for the worker, the artisan, such poor persons to get their full amount of money.
In addition, they are also becoming entitled to the other benefits due to them.
Our country is blessed with the maximum number of young people.
Thus, we are favourably placed for using technology.
A country like India should be ahead of everybody else in this field.
Our youth have benefitted quite a lot from ‘Start-Ups’.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity for our youth.
They should impart to this as much strength as they can with their new ideas, technology and processes.
But we must also connect with the drive to rid the country of black money and corruption with all our might.
My dear countrymen, I request every month before ‘Mann Ki Baat’ that you please give your suggestions, share your thoughts;
and of the thousands of such suggestions received this time on MyGov, on NarendraModiApp, I can definitely say that 80 to 90% suggestions were pertaining to the war against corruption and black money, there was mention of demonetization.
After I examined all the suggestions, I can say that these can macroscopically be roughly divided into three categories.
Some have written in detail about people facing difficulties and encountering inconveniences.
The other group of correspondents have stressed that this is such a good work being carried out for the welfare of the country, such a sacred task but they have also noted that in spite of this there are many scams being committed and new avenues of dishonesty are being explored.
The third group is the one which has, while wholeheartedly supporting the action being taken, clearly stressed that this fight must be carried forward;
corruption and black money must be completely destroyed and if this requires even more tough steps to be taken, those must be taken.
We have many people writing this most emphatically.
I am thankful to the countrymen for helping me by writing these innumerable letters to me.
Shriman Gurumani Kewal has written on MyGov - “This step of reigning in black money is praiseworthy.
We citizens are facing some difficulties, but we are all fighting against corruption and we are happy that we are making a contribution in this fight.
We are battling corruption, black money etc on the lines of Military Forces.
” The sentiment behind Gurumani Kewalji’s text is being echoed in every nook and corner of the country.
All of us are experiencing it.
When the people face problems, undergo hardships, rare will be a fellow human being who will not empathise.
I feel as much pain as you do.
But when a task is taken up with a noble objective, to realise a lofty intent, with a clear conscience, the countrymen stay firm courageously amidst all these trials and tribulations.
These people are the real Agents of Change, pioneers of transformation.
I thank people for one more reason.
They have not only braved hardships, but have also powerfully given a retort to those limited few who have been trying to mislead them.
So many rumours were spread, even the fight against corruption and black money was sought to be tainted with shades of communalism.
Somebody spread a rumour that the spelling on the currency note was faulty, someone said salt prices had spiraled, someone proclaimed that the 2000 rupee note would also be withdrawn, even 500 and 100 rupee denominations notes were rumoured to be on their way out.
But I have seen that despite rampant rumour mongering, citizens have stood firm with their faith intact.
And not just that, many people came to the fore and through their creativity and intelligence, exposed the rumour mongers, brought out the falsity of the rumours and established the truth.
I salute this great ability of the people also from the core of my heart.
My dear countrymen, I am experiencing one thing every moment.
When a hundred and twenty five crore countrymen are standing by you, nothing is impossible.
The people represent the will of the Almighty and their blessings become His blessings.
I thank the people of this country and salute them for participating in this Mahayagya against black money and corruption with utmost zeal.
It was my earnest wish that the ongoing campaign against corruption and black money, including the realm of political parties and political funding, be discussed extensively in the Parliament.
Had the House functioned properly, there would have been comprehensive deliberation.
Some people are spreading rumours that political parties enjoy all kinds of concessions.
These people are absolutely in the wrong.
The law applies equally to all.
Whether it is an individual, an organisation or a political party, everyone has to abide by law and one will have to.
People, who cannot endorse corruption and black money openly, resort to searching for faults of the government relentlessly.
Another issue which comes up is this.
Why are rules changed time and again?
This government is for the sake of the people.
The government continuously endeavours to take a feedback from them.
What are the areas of difficulty for the people?
What are the rules that are creating hindrances?
And what are the possible solutions?
The government, being a sensitive government, amends rules as required, keeping the convenience of the people as its foremost consideration, so that citizens are not subjected to hardships.
On the other hand, as I’d said earlier, on the 8th to be precise, this drive, this war is an extraordinary one.
For the past 70 years, what kind of forces are involved in this murky enterprise of perfidy and corruption?
How mighty are they?
When I have resolved to wage battle against them, they too come up with new tactics everyday to thwart the government’s efforts.
To counter these new offensives, we too have to devise appropriate new responses and antidotes.
When the opponents keep on trying out new tactics, we have to counteract decisively, since we have resolved to eradicate the corrupt, shady businesses and black money.
On the other hand, many people have mentioned in their letters all kinds of wrongdoing which are going on;
how newer wily ways and means are being devised.
In this context, I offer my heartiest salutations to my dear countrymen for one very remarkable thing.
These days you must be seeing on T.
V.
and newspapers, everyday many new people are being taken into custody, currency notes are being seized, raids are being carried out.
Influential persons are being caught.
How has all this been made possible?
Should I let out the secret?
The secret is that my sources of such information are people themselves.
Information being received from common citizens is many times higher than that being obtained through government machinery.
And we are by and large being successful in our operations on account of the awareness and alertness that the people have displayed.
Can anyone imagine the level of risk, which the aware citizen of my country is taking to expose such elements!
The information received has largely proved to be fruitful.
For those of you wanting to share such information, you can send it on an e-mail address set up by the government for this purpose.
You can also provide it on MyGov.
The government is committed to fight all such wrongdoings and maladies.
And when we have your active support, this fight becomes much easier.
Thirdly, there is another group of letter writers, also existing in large numbers.
They say - Modiji, do not feel exhausted, do not stop and take the most stringent measures that you can.
Now that you have chosen this path, the journey should culminate at its intended and logical destination.
I specially thank writers of such letters, since their writing exudes a certain confidence, fortified with blessings.
I sincerely assure you that this is in no way going to be a full stop.
This is just the beginning.
We have to win this battle and the question of feeling exhausted or stopping simply does not arise.
Armed with the good wishes of a hundred and twenty five crore countrymen, there is no question of a retreat.
You are possibly aware of a Law about Benami Property in our country which came into being in 1988, but neither were its rules ever framed, nor was it notified.
It just lay dormant gathering dust.
We have retrieved it and turned it into an incisive law against ‘Benami Property’.
In the coming days, this law will also become operational.
For the benefit of the Nation, for the benefit of the people, whatever needs to be done will be accorded our top priority.
My dear countrymen, I had mentioned in last month’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ that even amidst these hardships our farmers toiled tirelessly and broke last year’s record in sowing.
It is a sign of good times for the agricultural sector.
The diligent hard work by this country’s workers, and farmers, and youth has scripted a new chapter of success with flying colours.
Recently India proudly inscribed her name in various sectors of the global economic scenario.
It is solely on account of the tireless exertions of our countrymen that on myriad indicators, India has charted an upward trajectory in global rankings.
India’s ranking has gone up in the Doing Business Report of the World Bank.
We are trying our best to raise the level of the business practices in India to match the best practices in the world on equal footing.
And we are succeeding in that.
In the World Investment Report released by UNCTAD, India’s position has risen to third in the Top Prospective Host Economies for 2016-18.
In the Global Competitive Report of the World Economic Forum, India has made a big leap upwards by 32 ranks.
In the Global Innovation Index 2016, we have moved up 16 rungs and in the Logistics Performance Index 2016 of the World Bank, we have risen by 19 ranks.
There are many reports whose evaluation indicate that India is taking rapid strides ahead.
My dear countrymen, this time the session of Parliament became the object of ire of our countrymen.
Indignation was expressed everywhere about the activities in the Parliament.
The President and Vice President also explicitly expressed their displeasure.
But even in such a situation, sometimes good things also take place which create a sense of satisfaction in the mind.
Amid the din in Parliament, an excellent task was accomplished, which has not attracted due attention of the country.
Brothers and sisters, today with pride and joy I would like to mention that a bill in connection with my government’s mission on Divyangjan, that is, differently or specially abled people was passed in Parliament.
For this, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.
On behalf of millions of Divyangjan of the country I express my thanks.
Our government is committed to the welfare of Divyaangs.
Personally too, I have strived to lend momentum to this campaign.
My intention was to ensure that the Divyangjan secure their due rights and also the honour and dignity that they are entitled to.
Our efforts and our trust were fortified by our Divyaang brothers and sisters when they returned with 4 medals from the Paralympics.
With their triumph, not only did they do the Nation proud, they pleasantly surprised many people through their capabilities and prowess.
Our Divyaang brothers and sisters are an invaluable heritage, a precious endowment, just as every citizen of the country is.
Today I am immensely delighted that the passing of this Law for the welfare of the Divyaangjan will open up additional avenues of employment for them.
In government jobs, the extent of reservation for them has been enhanced to 4%.
Special provisions have been provided for in this Law for their education, facilities and also for grievances.
The extent of sensitivity of the government towards the Divyaangs can be assessed by the fact that during the last two years, the central government set up 4350 camps for Divyaangs, spent 352 crore rupees for distributing implements to 5,80,000 Divyaang brothers and sisters.
The government has passed the new law in consonance with the spirit expressed by the United Nations.
Earlier there were seven Divyaang categories;
now adding fourteen new categories this has been expanded to twenty-one categories.
Many such new categories of Divyaangs have been included thereby providing them for the first time justice and opportunities.
For example, categories like Thalassemia, Parkinson’s, or for that matter Dwarfism have been included.
My young friends, during the last few weeks, news items coming in from the world of sports have made all of us proud.
Being Indians, it is but natural for us to feel elated.
In the cricket series against England, India has triumphed 4-0.
In this, the performance of some of the younger players deserves a special word of praise.
The young Karun Nair scored a triple century and K.
L.
Rahul played a brilliant 199 run innings.
Test captain Virat Kohli batted extremely well and also provided inspiring leadership.
Indian Cricket team’s off-spin bowler R.
Ashwin has been declared ‘Cricketer of the Year’ as well as ‘Best Test Cricketer’ by the ICC for the year 2016.
My heartiest congratulations and many good wishes go to all of them.
After a gap of 15 years, there was good news, in fact grand news from the hockey arena too.
The Junior Hockey Team lifted the World Cup.
This festive occasion came to us after fifteen years as the Junior Hockey team won the World Cup.
Heartiest congratulations to these young players for this grand feat.
This achievement is a very good omen for the future of our Hockey team.
Last month our Women players too won laurels.
Indian Women’s Hockey Team won the Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days ago in the under-18 Asia Cup, Indian Women’s Hockey Team secured the Bronze Medal.
I congratulate all our Cricket and Hockey team players from the core of my heart.
My dear countrymen, may 2017 be a year full of joy and enthusiasm;
may all your resolves be crowned with success;
let us scale newer heights of progress;
may the poorest of the poor get an opportunity to lead a better and fuller life of happiness and contentment;
may 2017 be like this for all of us.
For the year 2017, my best and brightest wishes to all my countrymen.
Many, many thanks.
