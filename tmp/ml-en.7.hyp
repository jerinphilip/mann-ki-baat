Man Kee Bath, 2018 July (Mans say: 47 million people, Namaskar.
There are reports of high rains somewhere here.
Sometimes there are reports that there are more rains, sometimes people are still waiting for rain.
The geography and diversity of India sometimes shows the fun of rain.
But why do we blame the rain
Man chose the path of conflict with nature.
Its result is sometimes the nature envys us.
Therefore, it is our responsibility to love nature, to protect nature, to nurture nature.
By doing so, there will be balance in natural things.
Last day the news of a natural disaster has attracted attention all over the world.
He caught human minds.
You and T.
V.
I'll see you in.
In Thailand, the Football players took 12 children to the cave while dragging their coaches.
It'll take some hours to go inside and get out of the cave.
But on that day the decision of the fate was something else.
When they crossed a little inside the cave, suddenly heavy rains caused a lot of water near the cave.
They closed the way out.
Because they didn't get any other way, they searched for shelter on a small rock inside the cave. That's not a day or two, a few days.
If the kids see death in front of them, you'll think how long they'll be when they have to do it every second.
On one side, they were straightening the danger, on the other side, the humans of the world were mixed together with human roots.
People from all over the world were praying to get these children safely.
Children were trying all kinds of things to know where they could get them out.
If you don't save time, it'll be impossible to extract them for a few months in the monsoon season.
But when the last news came, it was peaceful to the world, happy.
But I think this event is another way.
How did the rescue happen
It was surprising that all the heads were responsible.
Everyone, the government, the parents of these children, their relatives, the media, the people of the country... all have been waiting for peace and forgiveness.
Everyone participated in the mission for a team.
I think it's a matter of understanding and understanding the behavior of everyone's comfort.
The parents weren't sorry, they weren't crying, but their forgiveness, restraint, society's peaceful behavior are all our lessons.
In this operation, a young man of the Navy of Thailand had to be sacrificed.
The world is surprising that they did not expect so much courage and sorry in a dark cave full of water in such a tough environment.
It shows that miracles happen when humanity is together.
I don't want to work for that with a calm and sustainable mind.
Last day our country's favourite poet Suraj ji left us.
Expectation, faith, vision and self-confidence were the specialty of the poems of Jews.
We are very powerful and inspiring to say to the Indians.
He wrote, "If you're supposed to be a bit of a bit of a bitch, you'll smell the blankets, and you'll smell the blade."
It must be dark.
Suraj ji pays attention to respect.
"Namasthe Prime Minister, my name is true.
I have been administered this year as a first year student at Delhi University.
During our school board exams, he talked about the stress and education of the exam.
What's your message for students like me now
July, August months are very important in terms of farmers and youth.
Because it's called the Peak season of colleges.
It's time for millions of young people to go from school to college like truth.
It's time for April-May to play holidays and to wait for the results and to decide the directions ahead of life and to choose a carriage.
Julai month youngsters retreat to new heads of life, attention moves from questions to cut off.
Children come from the daddy's cool to the professor's cool.
I believe my young friends will be very excited from the beginning of the circular life.
For the first time he went out of the house and went out of the village and got out of a safe environment.
So many youngsters leave their homes for the first time to give a new sense of life.
Many students have joined their colleges.
Some will be ready to join.
I want to tell you to calm down, enjoy life, enjoy the last person in life.
There's no way out of books, learning, but there must be a habit of finding new things.
The cost of old friends is very big.
Children's friends are not foolish, but finding new friends, creating and maintaining their own kind of consciousness.
Learning something new, gaining new new naives, learning new languages.
Those who went out to study outside their homes, know about that place, know the people there, language, culture, where there will be tourist centers, know about it.
New innings are starting, all my good wishes for the youth.
Now, when talking about the curriculum season, a student of a very poor family of Madhya Pradesh, Asharam Chaudhari, was witnessing how to survive the hardening challenges of life.
He won the first attempt in the MBBS exam of Jodhpur Ims.
His father drove his family with snakes.
I'm glad to his success.
In such a poor family, there are many students who have been inspired by self-service and dedication.
Father DDC's driver, Prince Kumar, and Abhay Gupta, who studied under the street light in the footpath of Kolkata, is the daughter of Afrien Shaikh of Ahmedabad, Afreen Shaikh.
Dad, daughter Khushi of Nagpur, a school bus driver, and a cartridge in Hariyana, a father who works in the bricks of Rashtriya Saheb of Jarkhand.
The sports were sold at Rashtriya festival sites.
My daughter Anushka Panda, who was suffering from a genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy by birth, and many of her visions and enthusiasm have brought the world's gains to watch all the obstacles.
If we look around, we can see many examples like this.
Any good event in any corners of the country gives me energy, inspiration.
When I tell you the story of these young men, I remember that sweat is the goal of life.
Suraj ji said : The landlord Gita wants to invite the swords to shine the sword with floral magnificence to the mountains.
My dear guys, a news came in my eyes a few days ago.
It was like that.
Two young men witnessed Moti's dream.
When we read more, our youngsters try to change the life of the common people with technological sermons.
It was possible that I was discussing Indian youths once in Sanjoz city known as the technology hub in America.
I told them how they could use their skills for India, and the time has come and do something.
I've requested Brian Drain to make it brain gene.
Two IT professionals of Raiberli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Wazpaiji took a different initiative by accepting my challenge.
With his professional skin, Yogeshji and Rajneeshji together prepared a smart gow app.
This app is not only connecting the people of the village to the world, but they know any information on their own mobile.
The villagers of Taudhpur village of Rai Baraili and the district magistrate and CDO inspired people to use this app.
This app is a way of bringing digital revolution in the village.
Recording, tracking, monitoring all the developments in the village are easy through this app.
In this app, the village's phone director, news station, waiting list, health center, information center.
This app is very beneficial for the farmers.
Ap's villager feature, the fact rates between the farmers are useful in a way as a ratio for their production.
If you take care of this incident, the young man will be living in America, where the lifestyle and thoughts.
Several years ago, India will leave, but the corner of its village knows, understands challenges, has a vital relationship with the village.
Because of this, he probably could make the village in a necessity.
It is natural in the minds of all Indians that they want to do anything for their own village, their relationship with their roots and their birthplace.
But sometimes due to lack of time, sometimes due to the distance, sometimes due to the surroundings, the thin layer of the spark is covered on it.
But if a small canal touches it, then everything appears once more, it takes it to the finished times.
Let's see if the situation, the circumstances, the surroundings, the skirmishes have taken us away, and we'll see if we're dead.
Certainly think...
"Adarnia Prime Minister, Namaskar, I speak to Happy Kakde in Kolhapur, Maharashtra.
The Parpur pilgrimage known as Pumarpur Wari is the old tradition of Maharashtra.
Every year it is celebrated with great enthusiasm and happiness.
The pilgrimages known as approximately 7-8 lakh weekends participate in this.
To know the rest of the people of the country about this different event, you have to tell about this sword.
Santoshji, thank you very much for your phone call.
Of course, Pumpur Vari is a miraculous pilgrimage.
Friends, Asha Ekadashi, this time is celebrated on July 23.
Panpur is a pious city of Solapur district of Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before Asha Ekadashi , i . . the pilgrimages leave on foot for the journey of Panpur with teeth .
Lacs of warriors are participating in this journey known as Wari.
Like Santa Gyaneshwar, Saint Tukaram, the singing of the feet of the gentlemen in the teeth is called Veddhal Vethal.
This verse is a triple synonym of practice, culture and respect.
The pilgrimages reach there for Vithoba's vision of Lord Veddhal, called Veedthoba and Panduran.
God loves the poor and the oppressed.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana etc. have immense respect and devotion.
To go to Veddhoba temple in Pampur and its magnificence, beauty, spiritual joy are different .
If I get the opportunity to tell Manki Bath's listeners, I'm sure you want to attend Parpur Wari once.
Gyaneshwar, Namadev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram, etc., innumerable punishments, in Maharashtra, even today, the common people are aware of it.
To fight against blind respect, this sanyasi tradition will be inspired on all the corners of the Hindustan.
The message of affection, affection, courage, etc. is received from all aspects related.
There is a wisdom to fight the society with respect to blind respect.
They have tried to stop the society from time to time, to fight, to avoid the old misconceptions of glasses and to create compassion and conscience among the people.
Our motherland is a terrible descendant.
Like a great tradition of saints in our country, the great men dedicated to India have dedicated their lives to this land.
And that's a great prince, the world's artist.
He was deep in the mind of many Indians.
On 23 July, we remember him on the day of his victory and August 01.
The world-wide guy was daring and self-confidence.
He had the power to demonstrate his fault to British rulers.
Twenty-two years, the Englishmen were afraid of treason treason.
It's not a little matter.
I would like to present a funny incident in front of you about the world-wide sculpture and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When Ahmadabad arrived in October 1916, more than 40,000 people came here to welcome him about a hundred years ago.
During this journey, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patil got the opportunity to talk to him.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was very impressed by the world-class basket.
In 1920 August 01, the world's legend became devoted.
It was decided that he would make a memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected as the Mayor of Ahmedabad Corporation.
He quickly chose Victoria Garden for world-class memorial.
Yes, yes.
It's the Garden in the name of the British ueen.
The British naturally became unconstitutional, the Collector continued to deny it.
But Sardar Saheb Sardar was Saheb.
He's firmly convinced that if he had to quit himself, he would have established the idol of the Word of Witness.
The statue was finally built.
On February 28, 1929, no one else, Mahatmagandhi inaugurated it.
The priest said, "Ahmadabad corporation was not only received by a person after coming to Sardar City, but also the courage, and that's why the statue of Tilakji was built."
My dear people, Tilakji is a very rare idol in a chair.
It's written below Tilakji, Swaraj is our birth rights.
I'm talking about the period of the British ruled.
Ganeshotsav was started as a result of the World Warrior's efforts.
With the celebration of the Ganesh festival in traditional honors and festivals, social enlightenment, social sentiment, people have become a strong medium to raise equality and equality.
It was a time for the British to fight.
Those festivals united everyone without caste and religious infections.
These festivals were being celebrated for the time.
It is clear from this that our ancient heritage and our heroes of history are interested in our young generation even today.
Today you can see the Ganesh Mandap on all the streets in many cities.
All the families of the street together arrange it.
A team works.
It's a good opportunity for our youth to learn leadership and organizational awareness, to develop their ability.
My dear people, I told you last time to take care of the environment's friendly Ganeshotsav, to enjoy generosity and enjoy this time.
This time, from the idol of Ganeshji, all the ornaments should be environmentally friendly.
In all cities, there must be competition for environmental friendly Ganesh festival.
Give them a gift...
My Geovi and Narendramodi Apple have a widespread publicity about environmental friendly Ganeshot festivals.
I'll sure get these things in the middle of people.
The world's aristocracy has made people self-confidence, and a pride, the kingdom is our birth rights, and it will be achieved.
It's time to say that Swaraj is our birth rights.
All Indians should have good results for development and resources.
This is to build a new India.
50 years after the birth of Tilak, that is, another son of Bharatamba was born on July 23.
He sacrificed our lives to breathe the wind of freedom.
I'm talking about Chandrasekhar Azad.
A young man who doesn't inspire these lines to be in India.
Sarfaroshi K. Tamana Ab Hamare Dil, Haidakhana High Geor Kitna, Majoo-e-Kate, has been inspired by many youths like Ashfaq Unah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azad's courage, his enthusiasm for freedom became a motivation for many youths.
Azad's life was homied, but he never bowed down to the foreign rule.
I got the luck of going to Alirajpur, Chandrasekhar Azad's village in Madhya Pradesh.
In Allahabad, Chandrashekhar got an opportunity to give honor to Azad Park.
Chandrashekhar Azad was unwilling to kill foreigners.
If you live, fight and die for freedom, you will die freely.
.
This was his distinction.
Once again, Bharatamba's valorous folk artist and Chandrashekhar Azad are honored.
A few days ago, Junior Under 20 World Autolitic Championships held in Finland created history by gathering India's brave female, farmer, Himadas golden medal in 400 meter hot competition.
My second daughter responded to fear of being alone and I'm e-mailed to know that there was a plan for Asian Games from Indonesia.
E-mails loneliness: "The most important moment in the life of an ablet is the moment of the triple flag.
I'm proud of what I've done.
"Ekta, we're all proud of it.
The name of the solitary country has been excited.
World Para Athletic Grand Pri 2018 got gold, Venkala Medals in Tunisia.
The success of unity is to make the challenge itself a medium of skill.
It's the only fear that in 2003, it's a terrible child who has fallen into the road accident.
But the boy didn't dare, and he aimed at empowering himself.
Another Divyaman Yogesh Kathuniaji Berlin established World Recade by gaining gold medal in Para Athletics Grand Priyal in Discus Tro.
Besides, Sundar Singh Gurjar got gold medal in Jawlin Troy.
The only fear and the Yogeshi fox and the Sundarsing are greeted with your adventure.
You're gonna be moving, playing, picking up more profits.
Dear people, August is full of many events and festivals in history.
But due to the weather, sometimes the disease will come home.
In this August month, which enjoys you to be healthy and patriotic, celebrates many festivals that have been going on for centuries.
I'll once again get together in Man Key Bay.
Thank you very much.
