What's the mind, June 2017, the weather is changing.
It was too hot now.
But fortunately, the rainy season is following its footprints.
The rain has started in some parts of the country.
After the rains, it feels comfortable in the cold winds last day.
We all saw the excitement or emotion in personal life or public life, the arrival of rain but our mental state.
Today the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath Dev in the different parts of the country is very enjoying and enjoying.
Today, in some other places of the world, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath Dev is celebrated.
The poor people of the country are specially accumulated with Lord Jagannath.
They studied Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, they must have seen that he praised Lord Jagannatha's temple and his traditions, because it has social justice and equality.
Lord Jagannath is the god of poor humans.
Very few people know that there is a word in English language uggernut, which means a beautiful chariot that cannot stop.
It is found that this word has come from Jagannatha's name.
From this it can be understood that the people of the world have accepted the importance of this journey of Jagannatha in their own way.
On the occasion of the journey of Lord Jagannath Dev, I am greeting all the natives and praying for Lord Jagannath.
The diversity of India is the specialty of India.
The diversity of India is the power of India.
Ramzan's holy month has escaped with a devotee.
This is the celebration of Christ.
I'm sure I'm having a lot of luck on my side.
The months of the month of the month of Ramadan, the months of the gladly distributed and the happiness of those who grew the same increase.
Come on, we'll all mix up with the inspiration from the festival of Epvitra and bring the country forward.
I knew a very inspirational incident in the Mubarakpur village of Bijnor of Uttar Pradesh in the month of Ramjan's Ipvitra.
He's almost half a hundred Muslim brothers and sisters in this small village.
To say most of the residents here belong to the Muslim family.
Everyone in the month of Ramadan decided to make a toilet.
17 lakhs of rupees have been given as a help from the help given to make a personal toilet.
You will be happy to hear and wonder at the same time that the Muslim brothers and sisters of Ramzan returned 17 lakh rupees to the government.
They said, our toilet will be made in our labor, our money.
This 17 million grams should be spent for other services.
I am thanking all the villagers of Mubarakpur at this holy time of the month of Ramadan for this change in social development.
Everything of them is very inspirational.
The biggest thing is that they made Mubarakpur a "free place of defecation".
We know that three states of our country - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared defecation free in unfree land.
In this week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared "defecation-free" in unfree place.
I'm specially grateful to the administration and the people of this prince to complete this work.
We know very well that we have to work hard to do some good personal life or social life.
If my hand says bad, it's gonna be careful for a long time.
That's how the physical and mental condition changes.
That's how it is.
Some bad habits have become our nature.
We have to make an effort to get rid of this.
Everyone has to focus.
Inspiring events will be remembered again and again.
I'm glad that cleverness is no longer a government program.
It's taking the form of an ordinary movement in society.
When people associated with the administration take this task forward with the participation of the people, the power normally increases a lot.
I remember a good event of the last day that I want to tell you.
This incident is the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
With the help of the people, the administration has taken a big job.
A restless campaign at 100 hours from 6:00 a.m. to 14th March morning 10:00 a.m.
Their aim was to make 71,000 families in Panchayat in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to hear that the people and local administration together have completed the work of making ten thousand toilets in 100 hours.
71,000 villages have been freed from defecation.
I am thanking the government officials and others associated with the administration and the villagers of Vijayanagaram district, who have created an invisible example of their hard work.
Nowadays, I have a lot of advice from the people for the 'Man Kiwat' program.
'Norendramodi app-A, mygov.in-A, through letters, all these suggestions are available in the sky.
Remembering the emergency, Mr. Prakash Tripathy wrote that on 25th June, a black day in the history of our democracy.
This glorious vision of Tripathy is not just a system of democracy, it is a culture.
"Eternal vigilance is the priceof liberty."
It is important to be aware of democracy and to remind the events that hurt democracy and encourage the goodwills for democracy.
On June 25, 1975, a black day that cannot forget any Indian lover of democracy.
The whole country was converted into a specific jail.
The voices of the opponents were stolen.
The countless leaders of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were defended.
The judgement didn't get rid of the worrisome situation.
The newspaper was completely unpredictable.
Students in today's press world, people working on democracy also recall black day and are constantly trying to increase awareness of democracy and should continue this effort.
Atal Bihari Bajpayee was also jailed at that time.
Atalji wrote a poem in the year of emergency.
He describes the psychological condition of that poem.
Flittering jewellery month, swimming joys of winter, bright joys of winter, blossoming sermons, rick halls, cut off for a year, cut off for a year.
.
The prisoner is a prisoner but a life-saving world, a prisoner, but a life-saving world, from the earth to the sky, from the sky to the sky, the song of the liberation is sounded, a year has been cut, a year has passed.
.
The way goes straight, sweethearts, days and days, or days and days, the Kumboo will come back, the Kumboo will come back, the sweet goddamn shrimp, cut off a year.
.
Democratic lovers fought a lot and in a country like India, in such a big country, when the opportunity came, how much of every citizen of India is spreading in the veins of the country, they displayed it through the elections.
Our immortal heritage is the idea of this democracies spread across every citizenship.
We have to make this heritage more powerful.
My dear patriots, every Indian is feeling proud of their heads in the world today.
On June 21, the entire world has become united.
From the sea to the mountain, people welcomed the ray of sun through morning and evening yoga.
Is there any Indian who's not proud of it
It wasn't that there was no longer observation, but today, when yoga was tied up, yoga became the cause of the world.
Almost all the countries in the world have observed this yoga.
On the one hand, where the Great Wall of China in China has observed human attention, on the other hand, people enjoyed the World Heritage site of Peru at a height of two thousand and a half hundred meters above the sea level.
The IFL Tower in France has taken the shadow.
More than four thousand people have gathered in the Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Amir Shahi.
The Indian-Afghan Friendship Dam in Herat of Afghanistan has given India a new gift of friendship .
There was a seventy-seven ceremony in a small country like Singapore and they carried out a campaign all weeks.
The Nation has published ten calls on International Yoga Day.
They published the ten mail tickets.
In the headquarters of the Rashtriya Sangam, the yoga system has been operated in the presence of experts.
Employees of the Community, everybody in the world.
Once again, the Yoga World Record has created.
In Gujarat, about 50,000 people united together and created a world record.
I have a chance to participate in the occasion of Laxmano.
But I'm lucky to join the rain for the first time.
Our soldiers have done yoga in Siachen where menus is twenty, fifty, forty-five degrees.
Our armed forces, the BSF, the I-T-B-P Hock, the C-R-P-Fhock, the C-IS-F, have participated together with each of their duty.
On this day, I said that three generations, since it was the third 'International Yoga Day', I said that the three generations of the family join together and join their photo shares.
Some TV channels have taken this thing further.
I've got a lot of photographs about this, some of them are snapped by a few selected photographs in the Narendermodi app.
The way yoga is going on all over the world, it is a matter of fact that with the help of yoga, today's healthcare society, they are keeping foot on Fitnessthe to Wilness and they feel that fitness has been important but Yoga is an excellent way for Waynes.
"Good Prime Minister sir, I'm telling Dr. Anil Sonar Amedabad, Gujarat.
Sir, I have a question that we heard from your face in Kerala that in different places we should give us good books as a memorial.
You've done this in Gujarat at your own time, sir.
But we don't see it today.
Can we do anything about this
Can't we do anything about it, sir
"A few days ago, I had a chance to go very dear one.
Better celebrations have been held in Kerala for a few days, P Enpanickur Foundation industry has created the habit of studying in humans, people are encouraging to read books, so 'reading day', 'reading mind' is being celebrated.
I had a chance to go early.
And there, I was told that we didn't bury flowers, I'd book.
My beloved.
Now I also remembered the thing that went away from the center of my focus.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I made a ritual in the government that we wouldn't break, that's what I'd give and or else welcome with a handkerchief.
He's gonna be a dagger so that Khadi's glory.
As long as I was in Gujarat, it was the habit of everyone, but after coming here, my habit went away.
But the habit of going to Kerala again is Jagethal.
And I've started giving notes to the government again.
We can smoothly create a nature.
Flowers are very low.
Once you have to take it from your hand.
But if I give you the book, it's part of the house, it's a family member.
Welcome to Khadi's handkerchief, how many poor people help.
The cost is also low and he's used as well.
When I'm talking about it, you know how fascinating it is.
When I got UK last year, London, Britain's queen, ueen Elizabeth invited me.
Mother's touch was there.
He did his very gift, but later he was very comfortable, in a sweet sweet sword on the khadi and said in an emotional voice, Mahatma Gandhi gave this romance to my wedding pleasure.
How many years have passed since the queen Elizabeth took care of Mahatma Gandhi's handkerchief.
And I saw him very happy to go.
I don't know when I was watching if she wanted me to touch.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi has become part of his life and has become a part of his history.
My belief that these habits don't change tonight and sometimes it's a critic.
But in spite of this, it should be highlighted, it should be tried.
Now I can't tell you wherever I went and somebody came down with flowers, then I wouldn't tell him, I can't do that.
But whatever it is, it must be compromised, but let's talk, it will change slowly.
My dear patriots have a lot of work to be the chief minister.
I have to drown in the file, but I have created my own habit.
I read a letter from all the letters I found and thus have a chance to protect connectivity with the common man.
Different types of people wrote letters.
Well, I'm supposed to have a letter.
Arulomazhi Sarwanan wrote a letter from a remote southern Tamil Nadu.
What are you writing in that letter - I'm talking about dealing with my world, trying to handle children's education so that there's some economic improvement in the world.
Likewise, I started obtaining some money from the bank in the 'Mudra Yojana' and buying some goods from the market.
I'm sure the government has started some arrangements with the name of Government E-Marketplace.
So I registered myself with the search.
I also want to tell the natives if we visit the EG-e-M site at the Cuckinternet.
This is a new system.
Whoever wants to supplement any material to the government, can be electric bulbs, can supplies the dostbin, brooms, chairs, maybe tables.
Whether his qualities, how much you want to live in, can write on that site and the government will make all that vigilant.
They're gonna see who's supposed to be supplied with a very low cost.
And orders accordingly.
The intermediate Dalal's day ended.
I mean, it's okay for everything.
I
The nterface will not do anything, with the help of technology, all the work will be done.
Remember, E-GEM will be a journalist, each of their proposals will be seen regularly.
Sometimes it's cheap for not being a broker.
This Arulomozhi Madam has registered all the resources to the government in the website and he has sent me a letter, that's very important interesting.
He wrote, I first met the "Mudra Yojana" and started my business.
Then I registurbed all my sales in E-GEM, then I got orders from the Chief Minister's PMO.
It was an unknown news to me too.
I wanted to know what the PMO wanted to buy
He told me he bought the dress Thermos and got 1600 pamphlets.
Yes, this is Empowerment.
At the time of the Entrepreneurship, if the opportunity didn't tell me, I didn't even understand this e-GEM arrangement, the villagers of the far-flung villages are doing some small business and buying PMOs from him.
This is the real power of the country.
It has transparency, empowerment, an interpreneurship.
GovernmentE-Marketplace-GEM.
I'm going to want the government to sell something like this.
I understand this is an incomparable example of Minimum Governance and Maximum Governance and its aim is MinimumPrice and Maximumese, Defense and Transparency.
My favorites, on the one hand, we can proud of yoga, and I'm proud of the success of the Space Science.
This is the specialty of India.
Jog has tied up on the ground of our country and we have a far-flung space campaign.
Before that, in the game, India has achieved a lot of success in science.
Today, India is not only in the earth, but also in the interior, bringing its success.
This trick has already launched 30 nanosatalites with ISRO Cartosat-2 series satellites.
In these satellites, apart from India, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America have contributed almost 14 such countries.
And from these Nano satellites of India, there will be a lot of useful information in the field of agriculture, in the eastern part of the natural illusion of the farmers.
A few days ago, all of us must have remembered the successful launch of ISRO GSAT-19.
It must be remembered as long as satellite has been launched, the biggest and the heavy satellite among them.
Our communications call this satellite a bigger one.
Consider how big architecture our scientists achieved in space research.
A thousand days of Mars Mission on 19th June.
All of you remember, for this Marse mission, we had to set up in Forbit with success and for six months.
It's been 6 months.
But what's the unusual skill of our scientists that crossed a thousand days after six months.
He's still sending a regular picture, sending information, sending scientific data.
It's over, but it's still working with success.
This one thousand days of our scientific journey is making great success in our space research.
Now I see our youths are moving faster in Sports.
Even in the field of sports with studies, our younger generations have glowed the country's name in their skills, their physical abilities.
That's why in India and Spain, India's badminton player Kidambi Champion has increased the honor of the country.
I'm congratulating Mr. Srikanth and his coach.
A few days ago, I gave PT Usha's opportunity to stay at the synthetic turf celebrations.
The success we achieve in the field, the sports, the Sportsman Spirit will continue to grow.
Sports play a special role in the development of personality.
Sports in the development of public personalities are important.
There's no dearth in the country.
If the family's kids have a swing to play, they should be decreed.
It's okay to drag the game out of the field and make it compulsory to study.
Studies may grow up, but if you are interested in sports, school-college-paid neighbors should inspire him.
Agami Olympics have to start dreaming newly.
Once again, the people of the country, the rainy season, the joy of celebrating festivals give speciality to this time.
I'm finishing all of you waiting to tell me something else in the "Man What Wall" tomorrow.
Namaskar
