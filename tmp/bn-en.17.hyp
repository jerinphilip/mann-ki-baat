What's the mind, September 2017, my dear countrymen, greeting all of you
Three years have passed through the airplane to do "Man Ki Wat".
Today it's the 36th festival.
The 'Man What Walt' is the kind of positive power in India, in the corner of the country, there is a desire, there is hope, there is a destruction somewhere - people think that the feeling is awakening, 'What or what' has given me a chance to connect with that thought, and I never say it is my "Man Ki With".
This 'Man What Wat' is connected to the mind of the countrymen, connected with their emotions, connected with their hopes.
And when I talk about "Man Ki Walt", then send me the people in every corner of the country their words, maybe I can talk very little, but I've got a lot of things.
E-mail, television, portal, through the Narendra Modi app, so much thing can be reached to me.
Most of them encourage me.
Many are for government reforms, sometimes there is a personal tuberculosis, and sometimes attention is attracted to the problem.
And I took you half an hour in a month, but humans keep on reaching their words for 30 days 'Man Ki Walt'.
And what happened to him is, the government has a simple idea of focusing on how far and wide the power of society is.
And that's why this journey of three years of 'Man Ki Walt' is a journey of patriots- their thoughts, their experience.
And perhaps I'm very grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity I had to know about the emotions of the common people of the country.
I often remind you of "Man Ki Walt".
Acharya Binoba often said, non-surkari, effective.
I've tried to concentrate the people of this country in the "Man Ki Wat".
I've been far away from politics.
The excitement, the excitement begins to shrink and I've tried to be connected with you with a steady mind.
I must admit, now three years later, sociologists, universities, researchers, geneticians must analyze it.
Take the plus-minus of every thing, and I believe that this judgement will be very useful in the future, a new consciousness, a new gesture.
And when I once said in "Man What Walt", we should think about how much we need, we don't destroy it.
But then I saw that there has been so many letters from every corner of the country, many social organizations, many newborns have been doing this long ago.
I'm very nice to enjoy my attention, and I'm enjoying what's left in the lunch.
Once I spoke of Chandrakant Kulkarni, a retired teacher of Maharashtra in 'Man Ki Wat', who had received six thousand rupees in his pension, earned five thousand rupees for cleaning through 51 post-date checks.
And then I saw how many people have come forward to do this kind of work for cleanness.
Once I see the Selfie With Dutter of a Panchayat head in Haryana and I put it in front of everyone in the "Man What Wire".
Not only from India, but also a big mission starts across the world.
It's not just a matter of social media, every girl has a new self-confidence, a new pride.
Every mother-in-law thinks shelfy with her daughter.
Every girl feels that I have no jewelry, there's no significance.
I was sitting with the tourist office of the Government of India a few days ago.
When I tell the tourists that you are me
ncredible I
Send a photo where you're on the ndia.
Lacs of photographs from every corner of India have worked in a tourist area, and they have become a very big treasure.
How big the small events make the movement, I felt in the "Man What Wat".
Today's willing, because when I think it's been three years, how many events have happened in my mind for the last three years.
The country has moved every moment to the right path.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the betterment of society, for the betterment of society.
On my trip to three years of 'Man Ki Walt', I learned it from the countrymen, I learned it.
It's a filthy rich treasure for any country, a filthy power.
I'm supposed to condemn the countrymen from the end.
I once talked about Khadi in 'Mon What Watt'.
And Khadi is not just a cloth, a heritage.
And I saw a lot of attraction for the Idaning Khadi increased and I normally said that nobody has to read the khadi.
But there's a lot of fabrics, why isn't it empty
There may be room sheets, may be romantic, maybe the screen.
And it seems that the attraction of Khadi has grown in youth.
Khadi's sales have increased and he has a direct connection with poor employment.
Two o'clock in the edge of October, there's a lot left.
I'm gonna say once more, we're gonna take the mission that's going on for Khadi, and we're gonna go further.
We're gonna buy khadi and burn the lights of Deepawali in the poor house, and we work with this idea.
The poor of our country will get one power from this work, and we should do it.
And to increase the interest of this khadi, the workers of the Khadi region, the people associated with the Indian government's Khadi have increased the enthusiasm of thinking in a new way.
How to bring new technology, how to increase production capacity, how to bring solar power and handicraft
The old heritage, which had been closed for almost 20, 25, 30 years, could be resurrected.
In Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi's Sevapur - A Khadi Ashram of Sevapur was closed for 26 years, but today it has been resurrected.
A lot of methods have been linked.
A lot of people have new opportunities for employment.
Khadi and rural training centers, which are closed in the Pumpore of Kashmir, have been resumed and Kashmir has a lot to be given in this area.
Now this training center has been able to work modernly for the new generation to start, to make new things, to make new things, and I like to give gifts at the time of the big corporate house Deepawali, they have started giving.
People are giving one another a gift.
We're all feeling how something moves easily.
My dear countrymen, in the last month, we all imagined a vision in "Man Ki Walt" and we decided that Gandhi would celebrate cleanliness throughout the country for 15 days before Jayanti.
I'm gonna connect people with cleanliness.
In our respect, the President started this work and the country was connected to it.
Embarrassed, male and female, city-village-everyone today becomes part of the cleaning campaign.
When I speak of composition, then we can see how this voluntary mission is going on in a way of imagination.
Everyone acknowledges it, helps and helps somehow for its success.
I'm grateful to the Honorable President, but at the same time, all the people of the country have accepted this cleaning campaign as their own work.
It's all connected to itself.
People in the world of sports-hone or the people of the film world, the people of the world of education, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, woollen, officers, kerani, cops, soldiers.
People used to use such a place as dirty, nowadays people express irritation, because they worked in all these places to look after them.
I think it's a good signal.
I am glad that more than 75 lakh people have joined this program with more than 40 thousand industries in the first four days of the 'Sensitivity Service' campaign.
I'm supposed to be doing some people's job.
They've been working until they get the suitable results.
This time I saw another thing - Firstly, one thing can be that we can clean a place, secondly, it may be that we cannot disintegrate any place in a conscious manner, but if the cleverness is to be made, then we need a negotiating change in our ideologies.
This time, a lot of competitions were organized in the "Sensitivity Service" campaign.
More than two and a half million children took part in the formulation of cleanliness.
Thousands of children have painted.
A picture of their own imagination about hygiene.
Many wrote poems, my little friends, the small boys who sent all the pictures I've been posting them to the social media today.
I'm writing their glory.
Whenever it comes, I never forget to express my gratitude to the people of publicity.
They took this movement in a holy manner.
They joined it as their own and helped in creating a positive environment.
They are still leading the Swachhta movement in their own way.
Our country's electronic media, print media can do so much service in the country, we're looking at the "Service Service" movement.
A few days ago, somebody attracted my attention to the 18-year-old Bilal Dar in Srinagar.
You're glad to hear that the Srinagar Municipal Corporation made the Brand Ambassador for cleaning Bilal Dar.
Whenever you talk about Brand Ambassador, you think he may be a hero in the world of film artists or sports, but that's not true.
Since 12-13 years of age, Bilal has been working with cleanliness for the last 5-6 years.
The largest lake in Asia near Sri Nagar also cleans plastic, polythene, used bottles, dirt dirt.
It's supposed to do something.
He died in his father's cancer at a young age.
The biography connected with the absorption.
According to an estimate, Bilal cleared more than 12 thousand kilograms of garbage every year.
I thank the Sri Nagar Palace Corporation for their vision of cleanliness and Brand Ambassador's election campaign.
Srinagar is a tourist center and all citizens of India have a desire to go to Srinagar, where it is really surprising to offer such importance to cleanliness.
I'm glad you didn't make the ancient Brand Ambassador, they gave Bilal the car now, the uniform.
Bilal is also educating people from other areas about the cleanliness, inspiring them and not leaving the hall until they get the results.
Bilal Dar is young but interested in cleanliness, they are inspiring.
I'm congratulating Billal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must admit that the history of the future is born in the pregnancy of history.
And when we talk about history, it's normal to remember the great men.
Months to remind us of many great men in October.
From Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patil was born in October this year, which led us in 20th century and one century, showed us the path of walking and suffered many hardships for our country.
The birthday of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, October 11, Jayaprakash Narayan and Puzi Deshmukh.
And the birthday of Pandit Dindayal on 25th September.
This year, the centuries of the birth of pirates and gentlemen.
There was a center of all these great men - what is that
For all of them, one thing was normal, that is to save the country, to do something for the country and not to give advice, to follow that advice in life.
Gandhiji, Jayaprakashji, Dindayalji were such great men who lived far away from the power, but every moment used to live with ordinary people, struggled, in the interests of all people, in everybody's satisfaction.
Puzzi left the country's front politics and focused on village development.
Today, when we celebrate her centuries, it is very natural to respect her village development work.
When the former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalamji, spoke to the young people, he often talked about the rural development of Puji Deshmukh.
In deep intimate, he mentioned the work list and he himself went to the village to showcase this work of pigeon.
Like Dindayal Media, Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the following people of the society.
Dindayalji talked about the poor, suffering, absorbing, changing the lives of a descendants of society.
He talked about how he could change through education and authority.
If you remember these great men, they don't have any advantage, we remember them, so that they can find the way forward, so that the right direction for the future.
I'm sure I'll tell you about the next "Man Ki Walt".
Probably 31 October, the Uniti program for run across the country is being run by an India's best India.
In every city of the country, it needs to be very big in the city for the run-Unity.
Now the weather is such that it looks nice to run - it is necessary to get iron power like a serpent.
Mr. Sahdev united the country, we need to take the unity mantra to run for unity.
We're saying very simple. It's the same specialty of India between diversity.
We're proud of diversity, but we're proud of the specificity, do we ever try to feel that diverse characteristic
I want to repeat all my natives in Hindustan, especially my youth, that we're in a waking situation.
Feel the disappearance of this country, touch her, enjoy her glory.
For the development of your inner personality, this variety of our country plays the role of a large school.
There's an instinct to get out of our country somewhere or somewhere on the holiday or the festival of Deepawali.
Everyone's out as a tourist.
But sometimes it seems, we don't see our country in that way, we don't try to know or understand its diversity, but on the contrary of foreign chocolate, we have started making foreigners more choice for Iran tourism.
You go abroad, I don't have any objection, but you'll ever see your house
People of North India don't know what is in South India
Doesn't the West India know what's in East India
Our country is very different.
When Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalamji - Everyone visited India, there was a new inspiration for the country to see, understand, save and live for the country.
All these great men have seen the country round.
At the beginning of their work, they tried to understand and understand India.
Trying to make India self-reliant.
Do we not even have different states of our country, different communities or clans, traditions, dresses, foodmakers, learning, learning, creating a lifestyle
Value addition in tourism will only happen when we are not just as audience, but will be able to accept, understand and commit the characteristics of that place like a student.
I have a chance to go to more than five hundred districts of my own Hindustan.
In more than four and a half hundred districts, there was an experience of nightmare.
Today, when I take care of the country, the experience of that tour is very useful.
That's why I have special advantage to understand many things.
My request to yourself is not only to see it as a slogan, but also to observe the store of our superpower.
The dream of an India's best India is in it.
How many types of food is there
Every day, if one kind of new food is eaten, it will not be repeated.
This is a great power of our tourism.
I'd like you to go out of the house on this holiday, just for a little change.
You need to know something, understand, have to be selfish - go around with such a promise.
Take India in yourself.
Take the variations of millions of countrymen.
This achievement will enrich your life.
Your thoughts will be huge.
What could be more than a teacher
Generally, the time from October to February is ready for tourism.
It's time for everyone to roam.
Believe me, if you're going to travel now, you're gonna take my mission further.
Wherever you go, share your experience and pictures, "Hash tag incredible I
I'm sure send your picture to the ndia.
If you meet the people there, send them a picture.
Not just the code or architecture there, but not only the natural beauty, but also the life of the people there.
Please send you all the excellent ways to Migov, send it to the narendramodi app.
I have seen a thing that, for the development of the tourism industry of India, if you can be the seven best tourist destinations in your own state, every Indian must know about these seven things in its own state.
If possible, it's seven places to go.
Can you give any information about this
Can you keep them in the narendramodiap
"Hash Tag I
ncredible I
Can you keep it in 'ndia'
If you see, if you send all this information to the same kingdom, I will tell the government to scrutiny them, and any seven common matters come from every state, make publicity about them.
I mean, how can the tourist destination be improved from a man's motive.
Likewise, the seven things you've seen in the entire country, you want no one to see it, you need to go there, know about it, then you're like seven places in MyGov, send it to the NarendramodiAp.
The Government of India will work on this.
It's a good place to see, to make films, to create video, to make publicity literature, to give it - the government will accept the decisions you make.
Come on, join me.
From October to March this month, you can also be a bigger confrontation in the development of tourism.
I'm inviting you.
My favourite countrymen, for being a man, touching my mind too, shaking my mind.
My mind has a serious effect.
Because I'm a man like you.
A few days ago, maybe your vision has attracted you - a surprising example of women's strength and patriotism.
The Indian army has found two virgins in the name of Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi, they're excellent heroes.
Excellently, Swati and Nidhi's husband were martyred to serve Ma-Bharat.
Can we imagine what will happen if the world is destructive at this young age
But Shaheed Colonel Santosh Mahadek, wife Swati Mahadik, fought against this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
For 11 months, he worked hard and trained and surrendered his life to fulfill his husband's dream.
Likewise, the Nidhi, his husband Mukesh, used to work as a hero in the army and when he died for his motherland, decided to remember his wife and he was also admitted to the army.
It's very natural for every countrymen to show respect to these Veeranganas on our women's strength.
I congratulate these two sisters a lot.
They awakened a new inspiration to millions of people in the country.
A lot of congratulations to those two sisters.
Between my dear countrymen, Navratri festivals and Diwali, there is a great opportunity for our country's youth.
FI
The World Cup of FA Under-17 is coming here.
I believe the buzz of footballs will be heard on four sides.
Each generation will attract football.
There will be no school-class fields in India, where our youngsters will not be seen playing footballs.
Come, when the whole world is playing on the ground of India, we have also taken this game into part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
Mother Durga's time.
The entire environment is full of pure fragrance.
Everywhere, a spiritual environment, a festival environment, a devotional environment, all this runs as a celebration of the worship of power.
We know this as a saradiya-navratri.
The winter season begins from now on.
On the occasion of this auspicious festival of Navratri, I give a lot of congratulations to the countrymen, pray to mother Shakti, to reach our country on the new peak of success in the direction of fulfilling the hopes of the common people of the country.
The ability to deal with each challenge will come to the country.
The country will grow rapidly, and in 2022, 75 years of India's independence - the effort to fulfill the dreams of freedom fighters, 125 crore countrymen's skeletons, oper labor, five years of road maps to fulfill many Purusha and Sankalp. We started our journey, motherpower give us blessings.
It's not very good for you all.
Please celebrate, enjoy the zeal.
Thank you very much.
