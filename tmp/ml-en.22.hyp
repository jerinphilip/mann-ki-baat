Prime Minister Mr.
On the 30th of April, 2017, the Tamilnadu language of the special launch conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population at 11 in the morning.
Namaskar for my dear countrymen.
From all parts of the country, before all Man Keeba, there is a lot of opinion related to Man Keebat from all the old people.
The sky is available, the Narendramodi gets the app, the My Gov gets through the phone, the message recorded.
I'm very happy to take care of it all.
There are many diversified information.
The power is lying in every part of the country.
The numerous contributions of the people living for the society, like the compatriots, are seen on the other side of the government's eye problems.
Perhaps it's the habit of our system, or the people are habitual.
Children's curiosity, young men's glory, and the experience of adults...
The government details all the opinions that come to Man Keeba every time.
Confession is, what's the complaint, what's the experience of people.
Everything.
It's the nature of people that advise others.
On the train, when someone's cough comes at the bus, he says he's close, do it, do it.
It's our nature to say, advise.
At first, when Man Ki Bath's instructions were received, he heard advisory voice and had something to learn.
Whenever its team felt it would be a habit for a lot of people, that's why it was sending it.
But when we tried to deteriorate it, it was really funny.
More than those who say these opinions, they're actually trying to bring me something.
To do good, they try according to their intellectual, power, right and environment.
When I noticed this, these suggestions are unusual.
It's an accident.
Some say that sometimes if this elementary thinking is heard by other people, it's a vast form, it will benefit a lot of people.
So they naturally want to indicate that in Man Key Bay.
These things are in my vision.
There are more opinions from the people who do anything for the community.
I show them gratitude.
Not just this, it's very pleased to be careful when there's something to talk about.
I'm sorry about eating food in Man Key Bay last time.
Continuously, Narendramodi Apple and My Gave moved so many new ideas to avoid losing food from many parts of the country.
I've never thought that our country is particularly young, it's been doing for a long time.
I know that some social organisations have been done for many years.
But now I understand that the young people of the country are engaged in it.
Many have sent me video.
There are many places in Chapati Bank.
In the Chapati Bank, people deposit the papa from their homes and deposit the kari, the needy buy it from there.
Those who give joy and buy don't shout their heads.
This is the example of how things are going on with the cooperation of the society.
Today is the month of April.
The last day.
May 1 is the establishment day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
On this occasion, I have many good hopes for people from both the states.
There was a period of seminars in the environmental environment.
And then, in our daily life, we are straightforward and surprised.
Nature has changed all the rules of the game.
The heat that occurred in May-June in our country has to be experienced in March this time only in April.
Many have sent suggestions about what to do during this summer when people accept their propaganda for Man Keeba.
Everything is prevalent, not new.
But it will be very useful to read about it right now.
Mr.
Prashant Kumar Mishra, T.
S.
There are many friends in Karti about birds.
They said, I want to put water in the balcony and terrace.
Small children in the family are very excited about this.
If they pay attention to how to keep water, they'll go 10 times a day if they have a plate, if there's water.
I'm sure the birds are coming.
We think it's a game.
But in reality, it is a good experience to wake up in the minds of the children.
You'll see a little bit of enjoyment with the birds.
Mr. from Gujarat.
Jagat Bhai sent me a book.
Save the Sparrows.
There are signs of the decreasing number of pimples.
And there's a very good description in the book that tried to protect them as a mission.
We're in our country with birds, animals, nature, and life together.
However, it is necessary to give importance to such things in a social way.
When I was Chief Minister in Gujarat, Daudi Bohra Samaj's Guru Syedna Saheb was hundred years old.
He lived up to 103 years.
The Bohra Samaj Burhani Foundation made a huge campaign to save the worms by his hundredth birthday.
I got the chance to start it.
They distributed about 50,000 crystals to the world.
Ginn's book of the World Records found its place.
Sometimes the newspapers, the milkman, the vegetables, the postman, etc. are forgotten to ask us if we want water or summer.
It's so busy.
Young friends, I'd like to tell you some things.
Many of our young generations are happy to live in a very comfortable condition.
Parents are very carefully enhancing them.
It's very different, but it's very comfortable.
Now the exams are over.
You'll have plans to enjoy holidays.
It's a pleasure to be hot in summer.
But I'd like to tell you a friend how to be your holiday.
I'm sure somebody's gonna tell me about it.
It's very good if I'm gonna use the three suggestions I'm going ahead.
But try to do something.
Be a new experience.
Let's have a chance to get a new nipunum.
I want to go to the unknown, unconscious, unconscious, unknowing.
New places, new experiences, new skills...
Sometimes see things in TV, or read in book, or listen to the experienced...
And feel the same thing yourself.
There's a difference between the Earth and the sky.
I'll tell you you try to know the interesting thing during this holiday, do a new experiment.
Experiments should be social, just a little out of comfort.
If we're from a middle family, we're from a happy family.
Those who take tickets at the second class of the railway without reservation, travel at least 24 hours.
It'll be a good experience.
Keep in mind what the travelers are doing at the stations.
Perhaps more experiences than the experiences that have been achieved throughout the year can get rid of these 24 hours without a reservoir, not even sleeping in a busy train.
You've experienced it once.
I don't want to repeat, I'll do it once.
In the evening, with football, or with volleyball, go to a very poor ghetto to something for the game.
Play with the poor children there.
You'll never see the joy of sports in your life.
Do you think the children who lead such a life in the society get a chance to play with you, how big a change in their lives.
Once upon a time, I believe I'm going again.
This experience will teach you a lot of things.
Several self-service organizations serve.
You're introducing the Google Guru, look into it.
Stay in touch with any such organization for fifteen-eight days.
Go to the forests.
Sometimes the summers will be organized, the personality development chambers will run.
There will be many developmental issues.
Cooperate with that.
Maybe you've been involved in the summer chains, individuality development courses.
Teach people who don't have the opportunity to learn what you're learning.
Technical science has come to minimize the disability.
The technologies came to shut down.
It's terrifying today.
It's a mischief.
Six of the same houses are in the same room, but they can't imagine.
Why
Everyone will be busy in their world on the strength of technology.
Social life is a culture, it's a power.
The other thing I said is about Nipunya.
You don't want to learn something new.
Today's the time of competition.
I have to drown in the exam.
It's hard to buy the highest marks.
Any coaching class in the holidays will be in danger of the next exam.
Sometimes it feels fear that our youngest epidemic is like humans.
They're leading a life like a machine.
Friends, it's good to be something in life.
It's good to do anything, do it.
But keep in mind if there is no humanity inside.
Be careful if you're away from human qualities.
Couldn't you make a little more attention in the Naipuran development
Please spend some time with you from technology.
Study some musical instruments, learn 5-50 words of any new language.
Tamil, Telung, Assamese, Bengali, Tamil Nadu, Gujarati, Marathia, Punjabio.
How many diversified countries.
Let's find someone who teaches this to us.
If you don't know swimming, you can learn swimming, but I don't know how to draw a picture.
If something comes, it will be a beginning to appear in your genius.
There are small things to say that you can learn with your mind.
You don't think you're driving.
Did you like to learn auto rickshaw driving
Did the cycles try to drive the cycles that people travel
It's not only how new things can be learned, but it's possible to get out of life within the limits.
Do something different, friends.
It's a chance to build a life.
After all the exams, if you think you're going to study in a new job area, the chance will be lost.
And there will be other problems.
So tell you, if you want to study magic, learn the magic of cheetahs.
Teach the magic to the next friend.
Try to learn something you don't know, you must have some good.
You'll have the peculiar talents inside.
We'll get a good chance to grow.
I'm telling you through my own experience, we can't imagine how much learning and learning the world is.
New places, new cities, new villages...
But if you go anywhere, look like a curiosity, see, discuss people, ask them...
It'll give you a different joy to see it.
Try and determine yourself.
Don't lose time for a long journey.
Go there and spend three-four days.
Then go to the other side and stay there for three days.
You can learn a lot of things through this.
Share me the pictures you're going.
What's new, where's it
Hash Tag Incredible Share your experiences with India.
Friends, this time the Government of India has made you a good opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from designs.
They don't need money.
They're starting to believe in digital deals.
Have you thought you could do this and wealth
There's a plan for the Government of India.
You must have downloaded Bheem App.
It'll be useful.
Also, teach someone else to use it, connect the new man with it.
If the new man makes three financial transactions, you will be able to earn ten rupees.
Ten rupees will be deposited from the government to your account.
One day you're gonna mix 20 of them, we'll get 200 rupees in the evening.
Merchants and students can compensate with this.
This plan is till October 14th.
You have a share in forming a digital India.
You'll be a guardian of Newഭാരy.
The holidays for the holidays, the opportunity for wealth.
Introduce the digital.
Our country usually has an atmosphere of hate for VIP culture.
But I realized it was so deep.
The government has decided not to walk on a red light in the vehicle, though it is a big person in the country.
It turned into a sign of VIP culture in a way.
It seems from the experience that the red light was on the carriage, but it rolled into people's brain and became a wizardly VIP culture.
Now the red light has gone, so no one can claim the red light on his head.
I got a very funny phone call.
People are worried about red lights.
Ordinary man doesn't like it, and feels straying through it.
Good morning, Prime Minister.
I'm talking to Shiva Chaube.
From Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
The government wants to talk about restricting the Red Beacon light.
I read in the paper, every Indian is VIP on the line.
I felt very proud of that.
To understand my time is too expensive.
I don't want to sleep in the traffic, don't wait for anyone.
In one of these decisions, you're very fond of heart.
With this voluntary program, our country is not only changing the VIP genius from our road.
Thank you for that.
The government's decision is a part of the legal arrangement without red lights.
But it must be changed from the mind.
If we work together, it'll change.
It's a newly-envisaged idea that IPI should be given importance instead of VIP.
Every personal essence impartant is important for everyone when he says IPI instead of VIP.
Everyone is important.
We can accept the importance of hundred and fifty million nationals.
That's how the greatest dreams possess...
Let's work together.
My dear countrymen, I always want our history to remind our culture and our tradition again.
We'll get energy through it, get inspiration.
This year we celebrate the thousandth victory of the hundred and fifty Indians of Ramanujacharya.
We're finished in other things just remember the centuries.
Shatabdi may be very important for other countries of the world.
But India is an ancient nation to celebrate thousands of years and more old memories.
How a society has been for thousands of years.
How would the thoughts be
Just imagine.
Even today, how difficult is it to dissolve social practices.
How could it be done thousands of years ago
Some people know that the evils in the Ramanujacharyan community, the luxurious sympathies, the greatest fight against the race.
He turned away from the people who believed that the society didn't touch itself.
Hundreds of years ago, he attacked to enter the temple and successfully completed the temple.
How lucky we were born in our society to avoid the evils of our society in all ages.
When Ramanujacharya celebrates the thousandth birthday, we will inspire to wake up the thinking of power in confronting social unity.
The Central Government for reminding Swami Ramanujacharya is launching a stamp on May 1 tomorrow.
Swami Ramanujacharya is honored and dedicated to honor.
My dear countrymen, there's another significance on May 1 tomorrow.
Fishermen are celebrated every day in many parts of the world.
When talking about the workers' day, it is natural to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar when talking about workers.
Lots of people know that we are entitled to Baba Saheb for the benefits and respects of the workers today.
Baba Saheb's contributions are remarkable for the welfare of the workers.
Today Baba Saheb and Ramanujacharya, the great Karnataka Sanyasi of the 12th century, remembers Jagat Guru Basaveshar, a social practitioner.
Yesterday I got a chance to attend a festival.
He had a chance to illuminate his poems.
In the twelveth century, he is deeply thinking about teaching and teaching in Kannada language.
In Kannada, he said, Kaya Kave Kailas.
It means that you can reach Lord Shiva's luxurious Kailasa through the study.
I mean that heaven can be achieved through work.
In other words, it is Shiva...
.
I often say I'm trying to win.
Regarding the importance of the job, the Dignity of Labor.
I am often remembered by Dattopant Tangdiji, the founder and thinker of the Indian Masthur group.
He was very worried about those who were slaughtering.
Inspired by the inspiration from the Mavod that the world workers should fight on one side.
But Dattopant Tengadi used to say, workers come and unite the world.
On one hand, while calling the Workers of the World Youth, Tengadiji said, "Workers are United the Wald."
Today, it's natural to remember Dattopant Tengadi when talking about workers.
My dear countrymen, after a few days, we will celebrate Buddhist Poornami.
The people of the world associated with Lord Buddha will be disappointed.
Buddha's thinking seems to be very confusing when the world faces problems, violence, war, destruction and weapons.
In India, Ashok's life is an excellent example of the journey to Buddha from war.
I'm so lucky to celebrate the U.N. President Vesak Dey in this great mountain of Buddhist Purnima.
This time it's going to Sri Lanka.
In this sacred occasion, I will get a chance to honor Buddha in Sri Lanka.
He'll have a chance to refine his memories.
Dear countrymen, everyday in India, efforts have been made to move with the Wizard of Sub Ka Sath-Subka Vikas.
Subka Sath-Subka Vicas is not only in India but also in the global background.
Especially for our neighboring countries.
With our neighboring countries, they must be developed.
There are many things.
India's South Asia planet will be launched on May 5.
The potential of this planet will help in fulfiling the economic and developmental advancements of South Asia.
Though tele-medication is designed, it is not in the field of education, it can be helpful even if it is in the context of the technological powers of the people and the people.
This is an important retreat of India for promoting cooperation with all South Asia.
A priceless gift.
This is the great example of our commitment to South Asia.
Welcome to South Asian countries related to the South Asian Satellite as their great effort and foolishness.
My dear countrymen are too hot.
Take care of your people, take care of yourself.
A lot of good luck.
Thank you.
