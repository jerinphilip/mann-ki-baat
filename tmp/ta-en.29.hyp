On September 25, 2016, in the All India Radical Radicals, the Prime Minister's complimentary composition through the Man Geepat (Mandi's voice) program, call me the people of the country, for all of you.
In the past, in the Uri area of Jammu-Kashmeer, the arguing attack was built, we lost 18 military warriors of our country.
Living, dressed military fighters are all trying to meet my uncles.
This evil potential is also a supposed to be a confession.
In the nerves of the people of the country, the sorrow increases, the anger boils.
This loss is not only the families of those soldiers who lost their kids, lost brothers, lost their husbands.
This loss is enjoying the entire country.
So the people of the country, I'm telling you before you on the day.
The culprits will be punished, they can't escape the sentence.
My favorite folks, we have immense faith in our military.
They will foil every environment with their success, in the way of comfortable, peaceful living, peaceful life of 125 crores of people in the country.
We're taking a lot of emphasis on our military.
We're citizens, political leaders, have many chances and opportunities to express our views, and we're talking.
But the military doesn't speak words.
Military shows his valor.
Today, specially, I'd like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir.
The citizens of Kashmir have begun to understand the enemy powers of the country very well.
In this case, they're starting to understand the truth, they're starting to travel on a peaceful path by removing such nervous powers from you.
Every mother father has the desire to start working in schools and colleges in a very fast way .
Farmers and their fruits like fruits want to go to the markets of India, want business to work well.
For the past few days business has also started functioning well.
Peace, compassion, goodness, etc. can be the end of our problems, we can be our progressive path, we can be the path of our development.
We have to hold the new peaks of development with our future opportunities.
I'm sure that if we dispose of the path to every problem by quietly losing, I'm sure the future Chief Minister of Kashmir can make our way to ourselves.
The responsibility of the security administration of the Kashmiri citizens.
The administration has to take some action to finish the law and order.
We have the power, law, law, law, all the use of law, which will ensure the peaceful life of the common people of Kashmir, and the security forces of the country are asking us to follow them properly.
Sometimes those who think different from our ideas prefer new ideas.
I've always got a lot of things to learn in social museums.
It enhances the power of the democratic system.
The 11th grade studying Sharshvarthan has preserved a difference in my attention.
"After the attack of your gruesome, I had a lot of concern in my mind, that something should be done, but I didn't know the way to do it.
Anyway, what a simple student like me can do with greatness - then I got up in my mind about how my action should be for the country's health.
I'll read more than 3 hours every day, I've been supposed to be a giant who's kind of something to do for the country.
In this enjoyable environment, at such a young age, you're making fun, this gives me the pleasure.
But Harshavartha is one of the greatest values for the anger that is drinking in the minds of the people of the country.
This is the exposition of the feelings of the people of the country.
This religious anger filled with the psychology of something to be slaughtered.
Yeah, you're gonna predict a manufacturing nucleus.
But you know that during the war of 1965, Lal Bhagdur Sastri was headed by the folk, this feeling was melongic all over the country.
There was a dream of patriotism.
There was a vision that every dweller would have done something in mind.
Then Lal Bahadur Sastri tried to give years to these feelings of the country in a very nice manner.
He gave the words of the Mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, the instruction of how the common people of the country should accommodate the merchandise of the country.
In the mirror of the storms, the patriotism propagates and an effort, every dweller must be appreciated.
This is what Lal Bhadur Sastri had done before.
When the Gandhians were guiding the freedom struggle, while the freedom struggle was rigidly dreaming, when they needed another threshold, they worked successfully as encouraging social works.
We and our military are responsible for our commitments, those who are responsible for administration, encouraging our customs, our people, every dweller, give us some organisational participant with this patriotic emotion, then the country will certainly take new peaks.
Carthik has confessed to the success of human emotion that our sports fighters who have participated in the Bara playback games.
Varun Viswanath has recorded our sportsmen in the Narender Mody Activity.
And it's also asking you to tell your mind on the hole.
Not only both of you, but every dweller in the country has had a feeling-free joint with the players participating in Para Twin.
Thank you sports, these para ollympic competitions and our tricks of sportsmen, humanitarian miracles, we've completely replaced the vision of the visualists.
Successors, our sister Deepa Malik, I've never forgotten the words I said after they were confused.
He said, "With winning this tragedy, I succeeded my body deficiency."
This line has a lot of power.
This time 19 sports fighters participated in three women of our country in Para Twelve.
In comparison to other sports, when the changing capabilities play, their ability, their potential in the game, the big thing - the mind, the determination.
You'll be surprised that our sportsmen have won 4 pieces of royalty till now.
Two gold dresses, one silver silver, one silver drizzle are included in them.
The golden brother has won gold for the second time in the competition to pick up the Davinder Jajaria Eat.
Twelve years later, it's been two times.
12 years older.
Once you've won gold, you've lost your illusion, but they have proved that the condition of the body, the age increase, has not boiled any kind of psychological obligation, after 12 years, they have come back to bed.
He's not the ability to change his life.
He had to lose a hand when the electric was blown.
Sympatheticly, the man who won his first goldstream at the age of 23, if he returns his second goldstream at the age of 35, how much he should be trained
Maryappan's stay, they've won a lot of gold in the high treasure.
He's lost his right leg in five years of age.
Depth couldn't even stop his mind.
He's not living in a big city, not a middle-class family, not a family.
At the age of 21, suffering life, not having bodily duties, only helping psychiatricity, has been confused.
Sports valorites are associated with the name of Diba Malik .
Varun Sea.
Bahti has won the White White Friendship in the heightening campaign.
There's an important significance of terror in our country, our community, our surroundings.
Our change-powered brother-brothers are our biggest focus towards them.
In the same way, when they're burying our feelings, we've changed the visions that we see.
This time, the Para-Tommere Magnificents knew about the excellent activity of the competitive brother-in-law who had changed us.
A few days ago, the matches were held in this place.
Can anybody imagine that the capabilities can change the replies of watchful matches
This time it happened.
The answer to the 1500-meter drive of the French match, the ambassador of Alzheimeria in the conversion team, Ladhip side.
Seven minutes less time.
It's a new answer to 1500 meters of drive.
Not only this, but I was surprised that the sprint for the changing powers didn't get any trouble in the frequency, but he had passed that distance shorter than he was hungry in a normal game.
I once again describe our greetings to these sportsmans, for the development of India Para ATA, to travel in the direction of a magnificent plan.
My folks, I had a very different experience in the Navasari of Gujarat last week.
It smelled me as a very emotional moment.
A Mega camp was organised by the Indian government for the change capabilities, in which many world சாதனைs were confronted.
I'd like to meet a little girl without an eyeball.
Gauri Shartul Shell Name - She's little child coming from the long forest area of Nang district.
Her heart is full of Rama.
When she told me some parts of it, I said that people were surprised to compare before the assembly.
There was a chance to publish a book on the day.
That book is a collection of success stories of some change powerful people.
There were many chances of hygiene in it.
The Indian government has found a world சாதனை in Navasari, which I believe is one of the greatest.
The procedure of the instruments to hear 600 change capabilities without the capability of the cartbut was displayed within an hour.
It's a place in the world's adventure book, Kinnas.
It is a matter of great grave for our folks that three world சாதனைs are being made by the revolutionaries on the same day.
On the 2nd day of October, on the date of 2nd October, we started the campaign of Gandhians on the birthday of the pure India.
I'm sure that cleaning is ourselves must be transformed, every drunken guy must be watched as a fucking asshole.
Now, on the 2nd day of October, I am sure that there has been awareness about cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore people of the country.
Likewise, everybody's been trying to take a step in order to say we'll take a step towards cleaning.
That is, 125 crore feet of the country are also advanced towards cleanliness .
If it's the right direction, it's complicated that it'll be good enough.
Well, government offices, roads, buses or railway stations, school or colleges, worshipped places, hospitals, kidnappers, village laborers, women, women all have embraced their share of sanctity.
Communication friends have also made a work of creation.
This progress, we still have to see progress.
But the beginning is very well, the whole thing has been done, the hope that we'll be able to win is shining in my mind.
It's very important.
That's why 2 crore 48 lakhs have been built so far that only 22 crores of toilets are built in the year and 212 crores of consumption are confirmed.
For health, the civilians should be avoided, the habit of excreting in the open.
That is why the open external excavation started to be freed from excretion .
There is a healthy competition between the state governments, among the districts, among the villages.
In Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala and other states, the habit of external excavation will soon come to an end.
When I went to the warfare of the birthplace of Gandhiji in Gujarat, the authorities had conveyed to me about the date of October 2 to come to the conclusion of the practice of excretion in the open open.
My lives are trying to slave it.
I'm asking the people of the country to get away from this problem for the safety of mothers and sisters, health of young children.
Come on, people, let's see the progress of the garlic.
Especially my younger brothers are using technology today, they want me to prepare a plan before.
How is the position of pure India movement in your city
It has the right to know that the Government of India has arranged a phone call 1969 to know about it.
The birth anniversary of Gandhiji is 1869.
We celebrated the centenary of Gandhiji in 1969.
The 150th anniversary of Gandhiji is celebrated in 2019.
In this 1969 approximately, you can also observe that you're not only aware of the situation of arbitrariness in your city but also to set up toilets.
You must get the benefit of this.
Not only this, you've started a clean ap to know about the consequences of sanitation, and their solutions.
You use it completely, especially young people use it properly.
The Corporate wants the Indian government to the world that you've got your partnership before.
The young technologists who want to behave for satisfaction support the industry.
We can use them as the clean India collaborators of the districts, the Swachh Bharat Fellows.
If this pure India campaign stands with the government, the progress cannot be seen.
Please don't fulfil with the nature.
In the same way, revenue model is also important to connect with clean health in today's era.
It's important to go from the toilet.
That's why along with cleaning, we have to travel from the toilet to the direction of Urma.
We're gonna beat sweethearts, the compound must work to change it.
For this, there has been a communication of the principle in government level.
They have been asked to buy compounds made from the toilet .
The farmers who want to be engaged in natural trading have to see the way they can get this salt.
Whoever imagines the development of your land, is in the health of the land, the land which has a negative effect on the chemical lions, should be given to them even if they need a little bit of this hell.
Amithap Bachan is coming to give his part in this work as a business dog.
I'm inviting youngsters to make Stard-up leads in the direction of going from the toilet.
Enhance these related machines, improve technology.
Enjoy a lot of products at cheap prices.
It's the job to do.
This is the job to make the largest level work possible.
The greatest economic activity can be triggered.
Trying to contribute from the toilet.
This year from 25th September to 2nd October a special program of Indian Health Ministry has been organized .
All over the country, the ministers, the predecessors, the town fairs, the soldiers, have been doing deep complications only about the sanitation of all together.
What can slave by technology
What kind of finance can be
How can people be shared
How can the workers grow through it
I've been discussing all the things.
I've been watching the latest news about continuous cleanliness.
I read in the news that the students of Gujarat Technical University were engaged in the work of making awareness about spending houses in 107 villages .
A dress under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramvir Singh started the Devprayag in Ganga till Gangsagar , 2800 .
Me.
We might have been questioning in the past that swimmers have brought about the message of sanitation.
The Government of India has prepared a year full of papers in its own departments.
Every area has to show a point about 15 days of special sanitation.
From 1 to 15 October, the Department of Water Supplies and Health, Punjab State Department, Development Department, etc. are being implemented jointly by formulating a sanctified scheme in the borders of the state government.
In the last two weeks of the month of October, from 16th to 31th of October and the provisions of three state-of-the-art farming and agriculture, food-food industries, subsidiaries, etc. will be pursued in their respective administrative limits.
If your work is related to these areas, I'm asking citizens that you should join it.
Now you might have noticed the conduct of pure research.
First research was conducted how cleanliness is in 73 cities.
It was placed before the people of the country.
There are more than 500 cities with more than a million population, now their way, every city, we're staying behind, we have to see progress next time.
There's a combination of sanitation.
Citizens, we have to give them how much we can share for this operation.
On the date of October 2, Gandhiji, the birthday of Lord Bhadur Sastri.
It's been 2 years since the pure India's operation.
I've been asking Gandhiji to start Deepawali, to buy some traitors.
I'm asking you a couple of times that every family buys a trail.
That's when the Deepa's light is burnt in the streets.
On the 2nd of October, Sunday, in the form of a dweller, don't we have any action related to sanctity
2 hours, 4 hours, you're asking you to join you in purifying yourself, share your smoking with me in the Narendra Modi Activity.
If you have a video, take that video away.
With our endeavor, the whole country will once again get strength for this operation, create a new pace.
Gandhians, Loll Bahadur, reassumed the Shastri sympathies, we'd be foolish to do something for the folk.
My favorite folks, who enjoy or not, the joy that gives me is incomplete in life.
The joy of giving is marvellous.
My wish is to wipe out the jewelry in the past days, the rewards given to the folks of the country are one of the most encouraging the life of the country.
Many youths of the country , small structures , carpet worker in the world , worker in schools , some government offices , all together are celebrating the week of enjoyment available in other cities from October 2 to October 8 .
It's the process of collecting food items, clothes etc. in need of money.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers came down to the streets, dragged the old game items in the family, brought them to the Anganwadi located in the camping area.
When the silver and silver enjoys the faces of those dreadful boys, you'll cheer up your mind.
Likewise, giving week of this joy is going on in cities, we need to enjoy the young people who operate it, to enjoy their enthusiasm, I want them to be helpful.
In a way it's a real excitement.
I read in the news that the students of Gujarat Technical University were engaged in the work of making awareness about spending houses in 107 villages .
They're supposed to share only 9,000 arbitrators.
I'm demonstrating my heartfelt life for the youngsters engaged in this work.
My beloved folks, today's 25th September, the birthday of Dean Dyal Upadiya,
Today his birthday starts centuries.
The millions of political activists like me, who demonstrate those political ideas, who are supposed to be supposed to be evil.
Political thoughts related to the roots of India, the idea of the tradition of the Indian culture, the singing of musical political ethics and humanitarian ethics begins today.
Sarvajan Hithai, Sarvajan Sukkai, everyone's health, everyone's happiness is his partition.
Gandhians also spoke about the health of the people living in the market.
How to accumulate the benefits of development in the market
Each bread work, every land, that water, in the same word, has already put forward the total economic plan.
The country has to celebrate his birth centenary harvest for health.
Social, government should keep the attention of everyone, how to bring the benefits of development to the poor.
From the time of the British the residence of the prime minister came to be called Race Course Road .
Pundit Din Tayal Upadiya has been converted to the Road Lock Kalyan Marg , a place of prime minister .
His centenary career Kalyan Versch, that's a symbol of the year of poor health.
I remember them very respectfully.
I started the chord of the mind for years before, on the day of victory, when you're in my heart.
It's two years long for this Vijaya Sami.
My endeavor must not be a program to pursue the voices of the government, but this mind shouldn't be a throne for the political upheavals of the mind.
In two years, many types of pressures have been triggered, sometimes there has been pressure to talk to some words in anger, even if there is a sense of hypocrisy, but you have been trying to communicate with the ordinary people not to swell in any kind of jewelry in the church of the mind.
What kind of instincts this monkey of the country gives me.
What are the applauses of the goods of this country
Records related to the values mentioned in my mind, etc. have come out in the cheek of the mind.
My idea is to recall the capacity of 125 crores of people in the country to recall the capacity of 125 crores of people, from which they should get inactive, this is the work of the program.
Today, this week is over, in this view of the New Year's fulfilment, how do you impatient, how Ashi Nalkins think, I'm enjoying, seeing my familiar taste.
I'm demonstrating my feelings, and trying to bring it into all languages, I'm demonstrating my heartfelt thanks to the sky.
They snatched the papers after the cheeks of the mind and gave instructions, snatching the government doors.
The government showed the disadvantages, the Academy prepared special events with such letters, took the representatives from the government level and set up a framework to solve the problems.
The voice of the mind has not stopped with any 15-20 minute conversation, it is a new context of social change.
What else can be the pleasure of this
That's why I'm supposed to see my thanks for all the participants in its success, I'm giving them my luck.
My native people, next week Navratri, Durga Puja, Vijaya Sami are coming, arrangements for Deepawali are going on, in a way different climate all over the country.
It's a power solution.
The unity of society is the power of the country.
It's going to be a Navaratriya, to worship Durga, to reflect this power worship, to make the path of social harmony.
That's the real power worship, when we do this, we can celebrate the trinity of victory together, and we will adhere to power.
We're gonna suppose the mantra of suppression.
Towards the new peaks of the confluence, peace, compassion, satisfaction, sacred days of purity, Navaratri, Durga Puja etc.
Let's celebrate the victory of Vijaya Dasamy.
Thank you very much.
.
