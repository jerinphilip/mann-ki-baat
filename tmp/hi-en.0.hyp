Talking to the mind, February 2019 my dear countrymen, greetings
It is full of mind today , starting talking about the mind .
10 days ago, Indo-Mata lost his heroic sons
These heroes, we spent themselves in the defense of hundreds of millions of Indians
The countrymen could sleep in peace, so, these our heroic sons, kept one by night and day
In the terrorist attack of Pulwama, after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, people across the country, and people have shock and resentment
The sensitivities towards the martyrs and their families are all around
The impulse that is in you and in my mind against this terrorist violence is the same in the interior of every countryman and is also among the humanitarian communities of the world who believe in humanity.
In protecting the Indo-Mata, I bow down to all the brave sons of our country
This martyrdom will constantly inspire us to destroy terror, strengthen our resolve
The challenge faced by the country, we all have to forget all the differences of casteism, communalism, regionalism and others so that our steps against terror are stronger than before, stronger and decisive
Our armed forces have always been introducing unique courage and power .
For the establishment of peace , where they have shown the magnificent capacity , the attackers have also worked to respond to their language .
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack
The army has resolved to destroy the terrorists and their helpers .
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational things of their families have come out through the media have further strengthened the whole country's enthusiasm.
Ramniranjan ji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, inspires us all the tongue that has introduced in this hour of sorrow
They said , Therefore they will send their other son to fight enemies , and if they are needed , they will be fought .
The whole country is saluting the indomitable courage of Meena ji , wife of Shaheed Prasanna Sahu , of Jagat Singh Pur in Odisha .
He has also tried to get his only son ROP Join
When the body of Shaheed Vijay Shoren wrapped in the Tricolor reached the Gumla of Jharkhand , the innocent son said that I would go to the army .
Today the tongue of this innocent expresses the feeling of children and children of India .
Similar emotions, our heroes, Parakrami martyrs are seen in the house
There is no exception in our single heroic martyr, his family is not exceptional
Whether it is the family of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya, the parents of the martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the son of Hemraj, the martyr of Kota, the story of every family of the martyrs, is full of inspiration
I will request the young woman to know, know the feelings that these families have shown, try to understand
What is patriotism, what is sacrifice and taste, for that we will not need to go towards the old events of history
In front of our eyes, these are living examples and this is the reason for the inspiration for the future of India.
My dear countrymen, for so long for freedom, all of us, the war memorial that was waiting is going to end now
The curiosity of the countrymen about this is very natural
Udupi on NarendramodiApp, Sri Omkar Shetty ji of Karnataka has expressed his happiness when the National War Memorial is ready
I was also surprised and there was no national war memorial in India .
A memorial where the bravery of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives to protect the nation can be kept alive
I decided that there must be such a memorial in the country
We decided to build National War Memorial and I am glad that this memorial has been prepared in such a short time .
Tomorrow, that is, on February 25, we will deliver millions of national soldiers to this national sailing monument, our army
The country will make a small effort to repay its debt
Delhi's heart i.e. the place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are present, just near it, this new monument has been built.
I am sure it would be like going to a national military memorial for the countrymen to visit a pilgrimage .
National Sainik Memorial is a symbol of gratitude of the nation towards the highest sacrifice of soldiers after Independence .
The design of the monument shows the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers
The concept of the National Sainik Memorial is centered on our Concentrical Eircles i.e. four cycles, where there is a picture of the journey from the birth of a soldier to martyrdom
Amar Chakra's flame, symbolizes martyr's immortality
The second is the circle of the bravery cycle which displays the courage and bravery of the soldiers
This is a gallery where the exploits of the bravery of the soldiers are carved on the walls .
After this, the sacrifice cycle shows the sacrifice of circle soldiers
The names of the soldiers who sacrificed the highest sacrifice for the country are written in golden letters .
After this the protector cycle displays safety
This circle has a row of dense trees
These trees are symbols of soldiers and convincing the citizens of the country that every guard is stationed on the border and the countrymen are safe .
Overall, the identity of the National Sainik Memorial will be built as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country, to reveal their thankfulness, to research them
Here is the story of the sacrifices who have enjoyed their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be safe and develop .
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the words of the country.
In October last year , I had the privilege of dedicating the country to the National Police Memorial .
That too was the reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be grateful to the men and women policemen who are constantly engaged in our security .
I hope you ' re going to see National Sainik Memorial and National Police Memorial
Whenever you go there definitely share your pictures taken on social media so that other people get inspiration from it and they are also eager to see this sacred place, this memorial
My dear countrymen, "Your thousands of letters and comments for the matter of mind, I continue to read through different means"
This time , when I was reading your comment , I noticed a very interesting remark of ' fire mukhopadhyay ' .
He has written that on March 3, 1900, British arrested Birsa Munda, then his age was only 25 years, it is a coincidence that Jamshedji Tata's birth anniversary is also on March 3.
And they write further these two personalities are completely two different family backgrounds which enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand .
In the matter of Man , Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata are like bowing down the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand .
Atish , I agree with you
These two great figures have enhanced the name of the entire country , not Jharkhand .
The whole country is grateful for their contribution
Today, if our youth needs any inspirational personality to guide, then it is God "Birsa Munda"
The British hid them very cleverly caught them when they were asleep
Do you know why they resorted to such a cowardly action
Because the British who created such a great empire were afraid of them .
Lord Birsa Munda had only shook the British rule equipped with guns and guns with his traditional arrows .
Actually, when people get an inspirational leadership, then the collective will of people on the power of arms is huge
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals .
He did all this in his little life .
In the dark life of the deprived and exploited , he scattered the sun .
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed himself at the young age of 25 .
Birsa Munda is the son of Bharat Maa, in every part of the country
Perhaps there will be a corner of India that no one has contributed in this war of freedom that lasted for centuries
But unfortunately the stories of their sacrifice, bravery and sacrifice did not reach the new generation
If, personality like Lord Birsa Munda gave us the identity of our existence, then a person like Jamshedji Tata gave big institutions to the country
Jamshedji Tata was truly a vision, who not only saw the future of India but also laid a strong foundation.
They knew well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry is necessary for the future
This was their own vision resulting in Tata I
Enstitute of Science was established now
Indian I
nstitute of Science is called
Not only this , he also established many world class institutions like Tata Steel and industries .
"Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekanand ji met during the US visit in Ship, then in the discussion of both of them, an important topic was associated with the spread of science and technology in India."
I say this discussion
Indian I
Enstitute of Science foundation .
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country, Morarji Bhai Desai was born on February 29
As you all know this day comes only once in 4 years
Easy, rich of peaceful personality, Morarji Bhai was among the most disciplined leaders of the country
Morarji Bhai Desai ' s name is the record of presenting the highest budget in Parliament in independent India .
Morarji Desai made India's efficient leadership in that difficult time when the country's democratic fabric was in danger
Our future generations will also be grateful for this .
Morarji Bhai Desai threw himself in the agitation against the Emergency to protect democracy .
For this , he had to pay a heavy price even in old age .
The government at that time arrested him and put him in jail .
But when the Janata Party won the elections in 1977 , he became the Prime Minister of the country .
During his tenure only 44th Constitution Amendment was brought .
This is important because the 42nd amendment brought during the Emergency, in which there were other provisions to reduce the powers of the Supreme Court which violated our democratic values - they were returned
As for the 44th Amendment , the proceedings of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies were made publication in newspapers .
Under this, some powers of the Supreme Court were restored
It was also made in this amendment that the fundamental authorities found under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution can not be abolished even during emergency .
For the first time, it was arranged that the President will announce emergency only on the written recommendation of the Cabinet, and it was also decided that the period of emergency can not be extended more than six months at a time.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the manner in which democracy was assassinated in 1975, it could not be repeated again in the future.
His priceless contribution in maintaining the greatness of Indian democracy will always remember the coming generations
Once again , I pay my tribute to such a great leader
My dear countrymen, like every year, this time too people were very curious about the Padma award
Today we are moving towards a New India
In this we want to respect those people who are doing their job at the grass-root level with a neutral sense
On the strength of your hard work different ways are bringing positive changes in the lives of others .
In fact, they are true karmayogi, who are engaged in selflessness in public service, social service and more than these national services.
You must have seen when the Padma Award is announced , people ask who is it
In a way I consider it a great success because these are those people who are not on the ront page of T., Magaine or newspapers
They are away from the world of glare, but they are people who do not care about their names, believe in working at the grassroots level.
Yoga : Karmasu Kaushalam has won the message of Gita in a way .
I want to tell you about some of the same people
You must have heard about the daitari hero of Odisha, he is not called the Man of the Disha, the daitari hero cut the mountain with his hands in his village and made a canal for three kilometers .
The problem of irrigation and water ended with your hard work forever
Take Abdul Gafoor Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job to revive Kutch's traditional romantic painting
They are doing great work to bring this rare painting to the new generation .
I gifted former US President Barack Obama , the Tree of Fie , created by Abdul Gafoor .
Among those who received Padma awards Shabbir Sayyid of Marathwada is known as the servant of cow - mother .
As they spent their entire life in the service of cow - slaughter , it is unique in themselves .
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who first tried to empower the victims and exploited by the Kalanjium movement in Tamil Nadu
At the same time , the community - based small financial system started
Listening to America's Tao Porchon-Ynch you will be filled with comfortable surprise .
Ynch has become the living institution of yoga today
Even at the age of 100 , he is training the people around the world and has made one and a half thousand people a yoga teacher .
Jamuna Tundu , known as Lady Taran in Jharkhand , boldly worked to take iron from Timber mafia and Naxalites , saved not only 50 hectares of jungle , but united ten thousand women to protect trees and wildlife .
It is the glory of Jamuna ji ' s hard work that today the villagers lay 10 trees on the marriage of 18 trees and girls on the birth of every child .
The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagli of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration, despite being himself Divya, it is difficult to get an example of what he did for the upliftment of Divya women.
By setting up an institution called Chakshu Mahila Sevakunj , they are engaged in the work of making blind children self - reliant .
Kisan Aunt of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, that is, the story of Princess Devi is very inspirational
He has presented an example in making women empowerment and farming profitable .
Kisan aunt linked 300 women in his area to Selp Group and inspired to make economically self - reliant
He trained the women of the village as well as other means of employment .
The special thing is that he worked to connect Technologi with agriculture and my countrymen, perhaps for the first time, 12 farmers have got Padma awards in the Padma award given this year.
Normally , very few people associated with agriculture and very few people doing direct farming have come to the list of Padma Shri .
This is the winning picture of changing India in itself
My dear countrymen, I want to talk to you today about a heart touching experience that I have been feeling for the past few days
Nowadays wherever I am going in the country, my endeavor is to meet some beneficiaries of "Ayushman India's plan PM-JA i.e. PM's health plan"
There is an opportunity to talk to some people
The mother alone was unable to treat her younger children in the absence of money .
He was treated with this scheme and he became healthy .
The head of the house, the caretaker of his family by working hard, became a victim of the accident, was unable to work - this scheme benefited him and he again got healthy, started living new life
In the last five months nearly twelve lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme .
I found how big is the change in the poor life
If you all know any poor person who is unable to get treatment without money
So let ' s tell him about this plan
This scheme is for every poor person
My dear countrymen, the time for examination in schools is about to begin
Different education boards across the country will start the process for testing the board of tenth and twelfth grade in the next few weeks .
All the students who take the exams, their parents and all the teachers have hearty best wishes from me
A few days ago , a big event of discussion on ' Warehousing ' in Delhi was held at the Format of Town al .
In this Town All program, I got an opportunity to talk, with millions of students of the country and abroad, with their parents, with teachers
It was one of the features of discussion on examination that the examination was openly discussed on various subjects .
There are many aspects that can certainly benefit students
All students, their teachers, parents can see the recording of this entire program on YouTube, then greet all my eam warriors for the upcoming examination
My dear countrymen, talk about India and do not talk about festivals
I can ' t do that
There is hardly no such day in our country, which is not important, which has no festival
because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture
After a few days the festival of Mahashivaratri is going to come and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday its special significance is covered in our mind temple .
On the holy festival of this Shivratri all of you have a lot of best wishes .
My dear countrymen, I was Kashi a few days ago
There I got the opportunity to spend time with Divya brothers and sisters .
He discussed many matters and his self - confidence was really inspiring .
When I was talking to a psychologist young man during the conversation , he said , I ' m a stage artist .
I am mimicry in entertainment programs, so I asked whom do you mimicry
So he told me that I am the prime minister ' s mimicry
So I told them to look at them and I had a very comfortable surprise, so they did the entire mimic of the way I talk about the mind, and "Mimicry of the matter of mind"
I am glad to hear that people not only listen to the mind but also recall it on many occasions .
I was really very impressed by the strength of that Divya youth .
My dear countrymen, "It's a unique experience for me to join you through the talk program of the mind"
Through radio , I am in a way to meet millions of families every month
Many times you talk to everyone, read your letters or hear the ideas sent on your phone, I feel like you have accepted me as part of my family.
It ' s a very pleasant feeling for me
Friends, elections are the biggest celebration of democracy
Next two months, we'll be busy in the gambling of all the elections
I myself will be a candidate in this election .
Respecting a healthy democratic tradition , the next ' mind ' will be on the last Sunday of May .
That is, all our feelings that are all three months of March, April and the whole month of May, I will start with the strength of your blessings with the strength of your blessings once again, through the talk of "Mann" and talk to you for years."
Then once I thank you very much of your heart
.
