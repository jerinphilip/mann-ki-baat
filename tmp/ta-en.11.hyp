On this sacred day, folks all live my heart.
We could see every moment of his life that the power of Ram Ram was in the life of a deserted man.
In the last days on 26th January , all the leaders of the countries of Asia had come here to bring you the Kalasarak group .
The most important thing is, most countries have given Ramayana before all of us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are not only in India but also in Asian countries of this region of the world, even today the same quantity of enthusiasm and affection.
I'll once again demonstrate Ram Nawami's life.

Shake them, I'm mixing your feelings with all the niers.
Do you know what Yogesh Batrasha has said

In the last days, the French country's guests had gone to Kazi when they came to our country.
Varanasi's Prasant Kumar has conveyed that the views of that journey were all touching, impressionable.

All these letters, so many phone calls, suggestions, if I can read from this, I can hear, there are many things in which my mind is touched.

Our festivals, our culture, our traditional subjects are dragging in the times of the festival.
That is, the things of the mind change the weather, the truth is that the voice of our mind has changed the weather of life.
Why don't you change
In these things of yours, in these experiences, in your specimens, such a prediction, such power, so much sympathy, something good for the country.
Among these the environment and change of the slopes of the slope country is present .
When I get the chance to read your letters, I knew how a rickshaw driver of the Karimganj district of Assam, Ahmed Ali, with the help of his deepest wishes, has built 9 schools to study poor children.
At that time, the vision of this country's unprecedented loyalty was expanded.
When asked about Dr. Ajith Mohan Sautri, a resident of Kanpur, who is treating the life-style, is giving free medicines, the feeling of the brotherhood of this country happens to me for years.
13 years ago, due to lack of treatment at the right time, the taxi driver of Golkata will die by the sister of Sethul Laskar.
He blossomed his mind to make a hospital that he didn't want to die because he couldn't get treatment.
Sethul sold the naves in his house to reach this planet, collected money as a donation.
Tourists traveling in his taxi have paid a lot of money.
A dragon's sister gave herself the first marriage ceremony.
In this way, collecting money, spending 12 years, finally the fucking tragedy of Cythol Lucker.
Today, due to his hard work, due to his tension, a hospital with 30 beds is ready in Bunary village near Kolkata.
This is the strength of the new India.
A woman in Uttar Pradesh, with a lot of struggles, to build 125 toilets, she enjoys the rights of other women.
My mother's power is snowing right there.
It's a sympathetic sympathy that makes the country aware, marked.
Today the vision of seeing India all over the world has changed.
Today, when the name of India is highly honoured, after this the unparalleled activities of this Etilas of Bharat Maa are obtained.
Today, all over the country, in the youth, in the women born, in the poor, in the middle of the people, everybody is born in this hope, yes
We can move forward, we can see progress from our country.
There has been a fascinating sympathy with motivation.
This is self-confidence, this creative feeling, relieving our dream of a new India, fascinating the tension.
My poor folks, the month of the month will be very important for agricultural brothers.
Because of this only archaeological letters have come to agriculture .
This time, when I see the analysis of the farmers in the Kisan wave of Dhurdharan, I feel that every farmer of Dhurdharan should join himself with the TD Kisan waveline, and see that the programs shown there should be dragged into their trees.
As Gandhians, Lal Bhagdur Sastri, they were, Lohia, they became Sautri Saran Singh, or Sautri Devi - all the farmers , agricultural workers have been embraced as a major part of the country's economic and the life of the people.
Her forget how deig the earth and the tend the soil, is to forget ourselves.
"It's the only thing that if we forget how to kiss the land, to recite the soil, it's ourselves unlikely to forget.
Like this, Lal Bhadur Sastri is also talking about the importance of trees, plants, vegetation, special agricultural structure.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia has said that we should be aware of the special income of our farmers, special waterfall facilities, ensure them all, increase the productivity of food, milk etc.
In his speech in 1979, Sautri Saran Singh asked the farmers to use new techniques and make new inventions, to argue about its needs.
In the last days I had gone to the farming fair held in Delhi .
While talking to farmers' brothers, scientists, colleagues, knowledge of many experiences related to farming, understanding, knowing about the observations related to the farming sector, etc., I had a very nice experience.
But I've had a lot of influence, Meghalaya, and there's only the business of the farmers.
This region, with a low land, has a great job.
In the year 2015-16, our farmers affiliated to Meghalaya have been successful in Mazoo, compared to the last five years.
If the target is determined, if you are full of jealousy, you can slave deeply, slave and slave.
Today technologies are also being handled for the work of the farmers, due to which agricultural producers are getting rich.
Many of the letters that came in me, the minimum support price for the farmers.
S.
B.
They're asking me that I should speak in a broad way about it.
Brothers, in the financial report this year, a major decision has been taken regarding the cost of agricultural produce.
I mean, there is no less support for the declared consequences, but it has been known as one-and-a-half portion.
If it is to be said in a broad way, what is the cost of at least support, the other workers who are involved in them, their serving employees, their professional legs, machinery or farming expenses, the cost of seeds, expenses of all kinds of vehicles used, the cost of water sanctuary, the land paid to the state government, the amount paid to the original property, not only for the cost, but also in the production of their own farmer or their families, their value is included in the cost of production.
Besides this, work on improvement of agricultural markets in the country is going on at the moment to get the right price for the agricultural producers.
The local markets in the village, the total markets, the efforts are being made to connect with the world market.
In the same way, the APMC, the e-NAM gallery will be coordinated to make 22,000 rural markets necessary for the farmers unnecessary distance to sell their consumptions.
That is , in a way , such a structure has been formed with any market of the country from the crops .

We'll also make sure that we're all yogic, folk and friends will enjoy yoga.
The new comfortable methods, the children, the youth, the senior citizens, all the old-fashioned citizens, have to be preserved further.
Moreover, the televisions in Nadeng, shields, which are present throughout the year, provide various programmes related to yoga art.
But now starting till yoga daily - can we have awareness about yoga .
My sweet folks, I'm not a yogician.
That's definitely a student of yoga.
But some people converted me into a yogic artist through your confrontation.
I've created immaculate panors like Yoga.
I'm gonna spare this knife with you
Through this we will fight the asana, the pranayama etc. together.
In order to keep the bodily conservative, the matrimonials expensive and smooth, and smooth, efforts are being made to facilitate.
Today more than 3000 people have opened medicine centers throughout the country, where more than 800 medicines are available at cheap prices.

To get rid of tuberculosis, we have to make efforts for our community.
My folks, on the 14th of April, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambethkar's birthday.
Many years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb had spoken about making India a professional knot.
It's a very effective means to make him dependently.
Its guess can make the workers work.
Today the campaign of Mac-In India - India is successful in the country .
And Dr. Ambethkar, he dreamed of being industrialized India, and his telescope is enjoying us all today.
Today India is growing a miraculous center of global economics, the world's largest direct investment-FDI has come to India.
The world has been looking for India as a center for investment, renewal, development.
Dr. Baba Saheb Ambethkar believed in the City of India that industrial development is only possible in the cities.
Her distance vision has begun today in Nadeng and Smart Cities and urban operations.
Through this all kinds of facilities are available in big cities and small towns of the country - they are providing good roads , drinking water organisation , health facilities , education or digital joints .
Baba Saheb was confident of self-sacrifice.
He doesn't want any man to spend his time in a long way.
And he doesn't think he's gonna get away if he's a little bit of compassion for evil.
Today, the Mudra Yojana, the Start of India, the Stand of India Fronts, the new conservatives of our small society, the industrialists and the youth.
In 1930 and 1940, Baba Saheb spoke about umbetkar ports and waterways when the roads and railways were discussed in India.
He is Dr. Baba Saheb, who sees the energy of the country.
For the development of the country, there was a gathering on the water supply.
Several legendary tribes, different armies of water- this is the distance of Baba Saheb Ambethagar.
Today historical efforts are being made regarding waterways and ports of the country .
There are new ports in different shores of India , construction of ancient ports has been strengthened .
Most of the differences in 40 were two world wars, the formation of snow, the division of the country.
During that time, Dr. Ambethkar, on one side, established a framework for the feeling of Tem India.
He spoke about the significance of the gathering, in order to promote the country, the Central and Matriculation governments have been involved.
Today, we accept all the documents of the administration as a cooperative federalism-competive federalism-competitor-competing sir congression.
It's a matter of great importance, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambethkar has been a preaching to millions of people like me.
He has shown us that there is no need to be born in a big family or a minor family, even in the poor families of India, he can dream of dreams of thrilling those dreams, in which he can see success.
Yeah, Dr. Baba Saheb took up the Ambethagar's guys and tried to put him back, not to slaughter anything, not to slaughter anything in life.
He dropped down trying to wear his dreams.
But the painting of the new India is completely opposite.
It's the dream of Ambethagar, India, the dwellers, the rest of the people.
Regarding Dr. Ambedkar's birthday, 14th April, till the 5th of May, the village self-reliants are being arranged.
Accordingly, various programs are being organized on Nadengum village development, poor health, social welfare.
