My favourite countrymen, Namaskar, July, 1981
There are good rains in many places today.
Somewhere more rain has become a cause of worry, some other places people are still waiting for rain.
Due to the vastness and diversity of India sometimes rain shows its choice.
But it's not okay to blame the rain.
Humans have moved on the path of resistance with nature, and as a result, nature sometimes distorted us.
That's why it is our responsibility that we love nature, protect nature, help in the development of nature.
Then there will be a natural balance.
In the last day, such a natural disaster has attracted the attention of the whole world.
Man's thoughts are overwhelming.
You must have seen in TV that a group of 12 teenagers in Thailand and their coaches went to a cave.
It takes usually hours to go to the cave and get out of there.
But that day, Bhagyadevi had a different desire.
When they entered a lot inside the cave, a lot of water accumulated in the mouth of the cave due to heavy rains.
Stop the way out of the players.
They were stuck on a little dune in the cave, not one day or two, 18 days
Can you imagine how long was that time when the youngsters were waiting to face death
On the one hand, when they were fighting the evils, on the other hand, people all over the world were united and praying to get these teenagers out safely.
All efforts are being made to know how they can be brought out where the girls are.
It wouldn't have been possible to bring them out for months due to monsoon if they weren't rescued.
Anyway, when good news came, the world got peace.
Happy.
But I'm supposed to see this whole incident in a bit different way.
It's really unprecedented how this entire operation was carried out.
The government there, the parents of the children, the family members, the generosity, the citizens of the country, has shown each integral conduct of peace and patience.
Everybody's got involved in this mission.
I think it's learning and self-confidence.
Mother and father didn't feel sorry or mother didn't water her eyes.
Everyone's patience, restraint, the calm behavior of the whole society is really academic.
A soldier from Thailand's navy was killed in this operation.
The whole world wondered that despite such a dangerous situation, the rescuers worked with courage and patience in the dark cave, did not hope.
This is what shows that when people get involved, there's a lot of wonderful things.
That's what we need to concentrate on our goal and work for it.
A few days ago, our country's popular poet Neeraj Prayat.
The poet Nier's specialty was hope, trust, determination and confidence.
The poet Nier's words can give us all the Indians a lot of strength and inspiration.
He wrote, "The darkness will be removed as soon as the light rises, the darkness will be removed when the light is burnt."
I'm supposed to tell the poet Nierz the inner reverence.
Prime Minister Namskar
My name is really.
I took admission this year in the first year of the University of Delhi.
You talked about exam stress and education during our school board-examination.
What are you talking about students like us now
July and August months are very important for farmers and young people.
Because this is the time when the pike session for colleges.
A million youngsters like the truth go out of school to college.
Examinations for February and March, question-answer.
With enjoyment in April and May holidays, it is spent in resolution, future lifestyle and 'Carier Chase'.
July is the month when young people move their lives in a nutritious way.
When the foucas moves from Koschen to Cut-off.
Students' attention goes from home to hostel.
Students enter the umbrella of the professor from the terrace of Parents.
I believe my young friends are very enjoying and happy about college life.
For the first time to get out of the house, get out of the village, get out of a safe environment and make yourself a guide.
All these young men left their homes and took their lives to a nuts.
Many students have joined colleges, many will join.
I'll tell you that, "Be Calm"
Enjoy Life
"Enjoy life completely.
There's no way out of books, you have to study.
But the desire to find neutral matters must continue.
Old friends are very precious.
Children's friendship is invaluable.
But it's very important to enjoy, friendly and run.
Learn something neutral.
Like new skills, learn new languages.
All the young men left their homes and went out somewhere else, they'd find that place.
You know about there, there's people, language, culture.
You know where there's all the exit sites.
My best wishes for new young men are starting the nude chapter.
When the college mortuary came up, the student of Madhya Pradesh had to talk about Asharam Seudhar.
I'm telling you, the very poor family's son has achieved success by passing the trouble of this hopeful life.
Jodhpur AI
I
He passed through the MBBS inspection.
Her dad's been slaughtering the slaves of his family forever.
In that situation, I congratulate hope for this success.
There are so many sad families who have shown their work and attention in the opposite situation that inspires us all.
Like Delhi's Prince Kumar, whose father D-T-C's habitual gupta, who studied under the light of the footpath road, is among them, Afrien Shakh, a daughter of Amedabad, whose father Auto, is the daughter of Nagpur school drive, Khushi, Kartik, the son of Hariyana Chowkidar, or Ramesh Sahu, son of a brick-brown mole.
Ramesh himself used to sell toys at the fair.
In the birth of Anushka Pand, the resistant girl of Gurgaon, who is a victim of a genetic disease called Spiinal Mascular Autopsy, has achieved success in showing the world by crossing all its determined imaginations and minds.
How many examples we're going to find around us.
Any good event in any territory of the country gives me strength, inspiration.
And all these young men remember my poet Niger's.
Neerz said about the purpose of life that I have to listen to the world, bring all the blind ones to win with the sword, and the mountains must wake up.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a news came to me, in which it was written, "Modi's dreams succeeded two young men.
After reading the news inside, I knew how our youth is trying to change the life of ordinary people with the help of technology smart and creative usage.
The incident was like this, once in the US's Technological Hab, San Jose, when I had requested them to discuss with Indian young men, they would think of how to use their talents for India and take out time.
I told Brain-dren to replace Brain-Gain.
Two I-T-Professional Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Bajpayee of Rae Bareli have confessed my challenge and tried a convincing effort.
Using their professional skills, Yogeshji and Rajneeshji made a 'smart village app' together.
This app isn't the only village people connected to the whole world, but now they'll get any information or news in their own mobile.
In the name of Taudhpur, the village head of Rae Bareli, District Magistrate, C-D has encouraged the common villagers to use this app together.
This app is acting as a single digital revolution in the village.
It's easier to track, monitor the number of developments in the village through this app.
The village's telephone directory, new search, event list, health center, naframation center.
This app is very useful for the farmers.
Ape's fitcher, the FACT rate in Kisans is working in the market for selling their best products.
On seeing this incident, you must think that these young people are living in the direction of the United States in the United States, perhaps leaving the country a few years ago, but still know the finest things of their village, understand the challenges and the village is connected to Emotionale.
That's why they probably made something according to what they need in the village.
This psychologicality is normal for all the Indians to see this yoga and for their own country with their village, their roots.
But sometimes for time, for distance, sometimes or for circumstances, a light screen falls on him.
But even if a small fire touches him, everything wakes up and brings us back to the days gone.
We didn't have anything to do with us, but we didn't distort our positions, situations or distances, so there was no significance.
Think of it.
Honorable Prime Minister, Namaskar
I'm saying satisfaction, Kolapur, Maharashtra.
Bari of Pundharpur means the punya Yatra is the old heritage of Maharashtra.
Every year this festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm and joy.
Approximately 7-8 million barkers attended.
Know the rest of the people of the country about this conclusive event, so tell me more about the "Bari" festival.
Thank you very much for your phone
Truly a miraculous festival in Pundharpur.
Friends, half a month's Ekadashi, which was on 23th July this year, the pious journey of Pundharpur escapes with jokes.
Pandharpur is the holy city of Kolapur district of Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before the half-month Academy, Barkari means pilgrims started the journey to Pandharpur with Paulki.
This journey, which is called "Bari", contributes millions of barriers.
Like Santa Gyaneshwar and Santa Tukaram, the saints were kept in the magic palanquin and were dancing in the name of Vithal Bhagwan.
This pilgrimage is the confluence of education, culture and devotion.
Lord Birthal, who is also called Vithoba or Pandurang, visited the devotees to visit him.
God defends the victims of poverty, helplessness.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana are very devotional and devotional to this God.
You go to the Vithova temple of Pundharpur, there is a different feeling of greatness, beauty and spiritual pleasure.
My request to the audience of the 'Man Ki Baat' program, if the opportunity comes, will definitely achieve the experience of the pious journey of Pundharpur.
Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram etc. are also teaching the common people in such a number of saints in Maharashtra.
They give strength to fight against blind faith.
All these territories of India have been inspiration for the sannctuary.
Shlo, like 'warood' or 'Abhang', we have the advice of goodness, love and brotherhood from them.
Society can fight with respect against blind faith, this spell we get from these.
They have shown the right path to the society at the right time and have ensured the old misconception of society.
I've come to men to think of compassion, compassion and purity.
Our landscapes are drenched in many gems.
There is a bright heritage like Sadhu-sannasis in our country, the great men of exact same worker have sacrificed their lives to protect the land of their mothers.
Likewise, he was a great man, Lokmanya Tilak, who made a deep impression in many Indians.
We remember him full of devotion in the birth anniversary of Tilkaji on 23rd July and 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was bold and self-confidence.
He had the power and intelligence of the British rulers.
The British were so scared that Tilk had filed a complaint against him for three or three times in twenty years.
It's not a simple thing
I'm telling you about a particular incident about the idols he has in Lokmanya Tilak and Amedabad.
In October 1916, when Lokmanya Tilakji came to Amedabad, 100 years ago, more than 40,000 people were gathered to welcome him.
At this time, there was a chance to talk to Lokmanya Tilakji with the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patil and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patil was very impressed by Lokmanya Tilakji.
As soon as the death of 1st August, 1920 Lokmanya Tilakji, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel decided to establish his memorial statue in Amedabad.
Afterwards, the city corporation's Mayor decided to establish the memorial of Mahamanya Tilak in Victoria Garden, named by the ueen of Brien.
Normally British rulers are very dissatisfied with this matter and the collector Bar Bar Bar used to offer the construction of a memorial named "Smaru Hela".
But sir, sir, sir.
He must resign, but folkly leave the memorial of Tilak.
Finally, after the construction of the Sardar Pattel statue, invited Mahatma Gandhi to inaugurate the statue on February 28, 1929.
In the Maha-Udghatan festival, worshipper father said, Amedabad did not find only one person as the Purashashashwara Mayor, with which he found such a power, by which the statue of Tilak could be established.
My dear countrymen, this idol that established the Sardar Pattel, has a special feature in the folk Tilkaji chair.
It's written under this idol, "Saraj is my birth right."
This written to the English was heard as God's instructions.
The first public Ganesh Festival was inaugurated in Lokmanya Tilak's industry.
Even after the civilian Ganesh festival became rich in traditional devotion and events, social awakening, unity, sympathy and harmony became an effective medium.
It was the claim that the countrymen were united to fight against the British.
Ganesh Festival helped to enforce the masses in the race and religion.
This festival began to grow with time.
It proves that our ancient heritage and the heroes are still crazy to the young society.
Ganesh Mandapa is now seen in the streets of any city.
Every family in that street organizes the Ganesha festival.
Works as a team.
It's a wonderful opportunity for our young men.
In this they can achieve special powers like organisation and leadership and develop them within themselves.
My dear patriot, I told you last time, today I recall Lokmanya Tilkaji and say again, you still celebrate Ganesh festival with Dumdham but celebrate the "experienced" festival.
His decoration from the idol of Ganeshji, should be all environmental.
I want to be a competition for Eco-Friendly Ganesh celebrations in every city, to be rewarded and to promote this environment-related Ganesh festival in 'MyGav' and 'Norendra Modi App'.
I must tell the people about you.
Lokmanya Tilokji invited the countrymen to be full of confidence.
He said, "Saraj will give up my birth right and he will acquire his right.
"Today we have time to say, "Source will give up our birth right and he will acquire the right."
"Goodness and development will have to be reached to every Indian.
This way new India will be created.
After the fifty years of Tilalji's birth, the same day, that is, on 23th July, India and a son were born.
Who surrendered his life so that the countrymen could breathe free India.
I'm talking about Chandrasekhar's pride.
In India, there are no obsessions who don't inspire to hear this folk, don't hesitate to Tanna Oh Hammer, yeah.
The lines of this poem were inspired by Ashfaq Nitin Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekhar.
Chandrasekhar had inspired many young men for the courage and freedom of the Ajas.
Ajad had lived his life, but he never lost his head before foreign rule.
It is my good luck that in Madhya Pradesh, Chandrasekhar Azad's village has a chance to go to Alirajpur.
Alahabad's Chandrasekhar Azad Park also got the opportunity to invoke honour and Chandrasekhar Azadji was the hero who did not want to die in foreigners, who would live to fight for freedom and die and gain freedom.
Once again, two great sons of India, Lokmanya Tilakji and Chandrasekhar Ajadji are honoured.
A few days ago, Journal Non-20, held in Finland, recorded history in the 400-meter race in the world athletics championship, India's brave daughter, Kishan Kanna Hima Das.
The country's and a daughter's unity e-mails me from Industries to my letter.
Now they're preparing for the Asian Games.
E-mail is writing the unity of any athlete's life, only when he's accumulated Teranga and I'm proud of it.
Ekta, all of us are proud of you.
You brightened the name of the country.
World Para-Athletics Grandpri, in Tunisia, won the golden and mine medals unity in 1918.
His success is worth mentioning that he has made his challenge a success.
In the road accident in 2003, the lower part of the body of unity is terrible.
But this girl didn't lose courage and made herself strong and reached her goal.
Another brave Yogesh Katuniaji.
He's won the golden treasurer by World Recording Discus Troying in Pera-Athletics Grain Pri.
A beautiful singer Gujjar also won golden in Javlin Throwing with him.
I am congratulating Ekta Bhayanji, Yogesh Katuniaji, a beautiful singer for his courage and struggle.
You guys go ahead, play, improve.
My dear countrymen, many events of August-Muslim history, full of events of celebrations.
But sometimes the disease enters the house for the weather.
I'm giving you a lot of pleasures for the good health of all of you, the inspiration of the patriots for the month of August and many celebrations that have passed since centuries.
We're gonna meet again in "Man What Want".
Thank you very much
.
