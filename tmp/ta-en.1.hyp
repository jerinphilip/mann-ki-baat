The voice of the mind, the folks of January 2019, desperate.
On the 21st day of this year, there was a deep temper.
Dr . Sri Sri Shivkumar Swamiji of Shri Chitkanga Monastery of Dumkur district of Karnataka has been appointed.
Shivakumar Swamiji dedicated his life to social service.
Lord Passeyswor, we've imagined Cailasse.
That is, by making hard endeavors, it will be equal to the renowned Kailash pilgrimage of Shiva.
Shiva kumar Swami is the one who is fighting this principle.
He served for his 111 year-old life, thousands of people for social, education, economic development.
Whatever extent his scholarship expanded, he had a very privilege in English, Samskrit, Kannada.
He's a social reformer.
He spent his entire life in food, imagination, education, spiritual knowledge.
Swamiji had come to the forefront of his life that all kinds of health should be received by the farmers .
Siddhanganga monastery is organised in a simple manner for greenery and farming fairs .
I've got many times to get swammies of swammy.
During the centenary celebrations of Shri Shri Shivakumar Swamiji in 2007 our former President Dr. A.
B.
J.
Maybe they went to Tumkur.
During this occasion, a poem written for swamiji was taught by Kalam Iya.
Some of its வரிs are my fellow citizens - in giving, you receive happines, in Body and Soul-You have everything.
If you have knowledge - share it if you have resources - share them with the needy.
You, your mind and heart to remove the pain of the sunfuring, And, see the dead hearts.
giving, you receive happiness allmighty will bless,all your actions.
This poem of Tagore Kalam Himalayas describes the sympathy of the life and symbolic monastery of Sri Sri Shivkumar Swamiji .
Once again, I'm gonna make such a man to see the pancreas with my sympathy.
My folk folks, our country's capital law was introduced on the 26th day of January of the year of 1990, on that day the nation was ruined, with great enthusiasm and happiness we celebrated our nation's day.
But today I want to talk about something else.
Our country has a very important structure.
It's our Jeanney's composition, more than our Jeanney-- I'm talking about the legislative executive of India.
On the 25th day of January, the organization day of the legislature committee, we celebrate it as a national vocal day.
When you see as much as the legislatures will be held in India, the world keeps the neck on the nose.
It's natural that the folks are humiliating everybody, looking at these specially held legislatures.
The country has ensured that every survivor who is booking the booking owner of India has to be given the right to earn.
In Himachal Pradesh at a height of 15 , 000 feet , argue centers are established in Andaman and Nicobar Islands as well .
You may have questioned about Gujarat.
In the Gir Wildlife, at a remote place, only one promise has been made for a single sword.
Friends, imagine...
.
Just a promise for a lawyer.
When we're questioning these things, it's natural to pretend over the legislative executive.
In order to make a promise to be used in the mind of a lawyer, the jurisdiction personnel of the legislature personnel also go to the remote areas to argue: That's the beauty of our genius.
I appreciate the legislative jurisdiction, which is constantly trying to strengthen the democratic system.
I appreciate the support of the other workers who are involved in the legislatures of all the states, all the security forces, freedom of the legislatures, and the people of India.
Conflicts are going on in our country this year.
In the 21st century, the newly born youths have been held in the Conventional Assembly for the first time.
The responsibility of the country is available to them only in their shoulders.
Now they are part of the country's decision-making process.
Your dreams were enjoyed to the dreams of the country.
I'm asking the young social friends that if you're eligible to win, surely record your name in the documentary list.
We all need to feel excitement in the country's guise, to make a promise, because this is an important study of the important achievements of life.
And there must be this feeling inside us that I'm sorry, too.
If you can't wait for something in life, we'll feel it sorry for us.
If we say something wrong in the country, we should be sorry inside.
Yes
I didn't promise, I didn't come to promise the day-- that's why we'd realize this responsibility that this country is going on today.
This activity must change ourselves.
It must be our culture.
I'm asking for the privileges of the country that we should make a warning on the day of the meeting, summoning the voluntary day.
I'm sure the young guys will record their names in a large number, and I'm sure your partners will be able to make our Jeanney's merchandise, strengthen it further.
My dearest folks, in this great land of India, many times glorifies glory, have been doing some magnificent, unforgettable acts for those great men, human society.
In our country the gems of these great human beings are hunted in immortality .
One of such great men is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.
His birthday was celebrated on the 23rd day of January in a new way.
On the birthday of Naitaji, the participants in the country's freedom struggle had come to me a great deal of opening a museum dedicated to the well-known fighters.
Inside the Red Fort many such rooms and memories are closed so far as the freedom of the Red Fort begins.
In this way , the ruins of the Red Fort have been converted into very magnificent museums , the museum named Naitaji Subhash Chandra Bose and the National Military of India .
The museum built in the memory of the first freedom fighter of India in 1857 has been dedicated to this melodious complex as Granti Mantra i . . revolutionary temple .
Every brick in this museum smells the glory of our glorious history.
Everywhere in the museum, the tales of our freedom fighters and ears are predicted by our salvation in history.
At this very moment the British government filed a trial on the warrior of Bharat Maa , Colonel Bream Saykal, Colonel Kurbhaksh Singh Tilllon, Major General Shanawas Khan.
When I came to see the memories associated with Netaji in the revolutionary temple of the Red Fort, one of the family of Netaji gave me a very special hat.
Netaji was wearing that hat once.
I've given that hat to the museum, through which people coming there can see it, they'll reach the patriotic thrill.
In fact, our brother-in-law's valor and patriotism requires our new headlines to be reinforced in different segments.
I went to Andaman - Nicobar Islands on the 30th day of December just a month ago .
Neethaji Subhash Chandra Bose had found me the chance to fly the silver flag at any place before 75 years .
Like this in the month of October 2018 I was surprised to fly the crown flag in the Red Fort .
Because on the 15th day of August there is a traditional snake snake .
On this occasion, the information related to Asad Hindu government was made 75 years ago.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier, a powerful administration.
Such a brave warrior has given an important part in the freedom struggle.
Delhi Salo, give me a salvation, and I give you freedom, such awareness, enjoyment and enjoyment, Naitaji plunges away from every Indian's mind.
For many years, there was a need to bring the secrets about him to the public.
I'm just enjoyed that we're reporting this work.
I didn't really think Netaji's family members came to my house one day.
We've talked about many things related to Netaji, and we've conveyed our concerns to Netaji Bose.
Efforts have been made to improve many places related to the great brothers of India in Delhi .
It's 26, Alipur Road, Sardar Boat Museum related to Baba Saheb Ambethak, and Granthi Mantra.
If you come to Delhi, definitely go to these places.
My folks filled in my mind, today when we're talking about Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, that too, I'd like to share with you a matter of life related to Naitaji's life.
I've always been absorbing the radiation of an important composition with the people.
Like this, Netaji also had a deep connection with the translation, he used to make communicating to the folk people through the radio.
In the year 1942, Subhash Baba started the Hindi translation, through the medium of drifting, in the Asian Hindu military warriors and in the public.
Goodbye, Papu will talk to you in the radio.
What he'd say before he starts the conversation is Subhash Chandra Bose speaking to you over the Azad Hand Radio, the Nairs will only hear these words a new thrill, a new energy.
This transmission station has conveyed to me that news has been swapping every week.
It has been sorted out in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjab, Pashto, Urdu.
In this restaurant administration, M lived in Gujarat.
Ar.
Vyas is the most important participant.
The programmes swinging in Asad Hindu Radio were very distinguished among the common people, whose events gave us a lot of strength to our freedom fighters.
A museum is built in this revolutionary temple .
Trying to demonstrate Indian art and culture in a more attractive manner of blackness.
There are four historical museums in the museum where there are more than 450 paintings and art works of 3 centuries old .
The most important compositions of great artists like Amruta Sherkill , Raja Ravi Varma , Avindranath Tathur , Kakendranath Tathur , Nandlal , Bose , Jamini Rai , Cylos Mugharji have been observed in the museum .
You all go there and see Gurudev Rabindranath Thaur, especially I'm asking all of you to see their creations.
Damn, maybe it's talking about art, but here you can understand that Gurudev Rabindranath is talking about the special compositions of Tagore.
You all know Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a artist, a musician.
But I'd like to tell you that Gurudev is also a painter.
He's putting paintings on many things.
He's finishing animals and birds, painting many beautiful scenes.
Not just this, he's locked up by human utensils, art.
The special thing is that Gurudev Thaur has not given any name to most of his creators.
He believed that the person who saw the picture himself should understand it, he should see the message given by that picture in his eyes.
His paintings are depicted in European countries, Russia, America.
I believe you must visit Granthi Mantra and see his paintings.
My sacred land is full of folk, India, pious.
Our pilgrimages have conveyed messages of goodness, equality and social authority through their thoughts and actions.
Such a shrine is Chand Ravitas.
Ravitas' birthday on the 19th of February.
The poems of the pilgrimage Ravitas are very famous .
Ravitas will give them a big message in some taxes.
Jadi-Jadi-Man Jati Hai, Joe Ketan K. Bath, Ritas Manush Na Jud Sake, Jap Tak Jati Na Jati.
It means that if the skin is dripped inside the skin, then the layer of the skin is swallowed again as a layer, then there is no sweetness in the end, no way the furnace goes to the whole tree, the same way if the man is divided into slaves, where the man doesn't go.
In fact, if God bursts all human beings, he wouldn't be very fond of seeing them divided into slaves, religions, divisions.
Guru Ravitas was born on the sacred land of Varanasi.
Pilgrimage Ravitas has been trying to understand the importance of his friendly life and worker through his messages.
It's not fair to say that he took the thrill of the world's importance.
Mon Sanga To Katraudi Man Ganga.
He'll tell you that.
It means that if your mind and heart are sacred, it is the meaning of God in your heart.
Devotees of Ravidas have influenced all the divisions of society .
It's the Citruor Maharaj, the Maharani, the Meerabai, the people who follow him.
I'm holding them in my memory once again, Holy Ravitas.
My dear folks, in MyGov, Kirna Siddar is asking them to talk to the mind about the future of the Indian planet.
And he's observing that the students should ask me about the interests of space, the survival, and the suppression of the wind.
Kirna, they're your ideas, that too, especially for our children, I'm demonstrating my appreciations to you.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmadabad, where Dr.
I got the chance to open the statue of Vikram Sarabai.
Dr.
Vikram Sarabai has given an important part of India's transport plan.
Our plan of transport is a part of the unprecedented young scientists of the country.
It's a matter of our heart shrinking the space, soundingrockets, efficient artifacts by our students.
On the 24th day of this month of January itself Kalamsad was made by our students .
Sounding rockets made by university students in Orissa are also popular .
The number of transportation machines taken by the country till the first year of 2014 has been undertaken in the last few years.
We're trying to transport 104 artificial plans in the same space.
We will soon record the location of India in Chandran by Chandrayaan-2.
Our country is doing the use of transport technology in a very special way for the protection of lifestyle .
In addition to sweeping, railing and road safety, transport technology is also helpful.
NAVIC instruments have been developed in our living brothers, which helps them safely, economically.
We are pursuing government services and responsibility by using space technology in a special way .
According to the program of householding for everyone, only 40 lakh households have been given geo-tech in 23 states.
Besides this , only Munnarik Kodich elements have been geo-decked according to the work plan of Mahatma Gandhi Development Department .
Our artifacts today mark the growing power of the country.
It's because of its partition that we have made special relations with many countries of the world.
It's a remarkable endeavor of technological artifacts, which gives us the evaporation of the development of the native countries in the hindrance.
Through its special competing airlines, India is not only enhancing the country but also the artificial principles of the developed countries.
Winds and winds have always come from the points of attracting children.
We have to think bigger, so far we've seen everything's unsuccessful, we'll plan our chances and chances to move forward to those limitations.
With our children being attracted by drills, looking for new stars and enjoying distances.
I've always told you that those who play my favorite folks, they grow, glorify.
This time the sportsmen gathered in Callo India are lightened.
In the month of January , only 6,000 sports fighters participated in 18 sports sports of Callo India youth .
If the local environment of our sports is strong, that if our footprints are strong, our youth can showcase your capabilities to the nation and the world.
If the local sportsman acts specially, he can understand the most important activity of the world as well.
This time in Callo India the sportsmen associated with all the states also showed their skills .
The life of many sportsmen who won the troubles is very enlightening.
Akash Korka, a young sportsman, won the silver drive.
I read that Akash's father, Ramesh, he's supposed to be a cousin in Pune.
He lives with his family in a car stopping treasure.
Like this, 21-year-old ladies live in Sadhara, the Captain Sonali Helvi of the Maharashtra group.
He lost his father at a young age, his brother and his own mother have been inspired by Sonali's trust.

But Tandi chose them all, specially worked.

My folk folks, you've always been questioned about many beautiful competitions.
But didn't you ask about the competition to shine the toilet

The name of this unique competition is a purely beautiful adventure.
Even if people keep their toilets clean, shining it, using some paintings.
