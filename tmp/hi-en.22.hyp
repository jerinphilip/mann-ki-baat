Talking about the mind, April 2017, my dear countrymen, greetings.
Prior to every "mind", from every corner of the country, people of every age group, "There are many suggestions by taking the matter of mind."
Comes on the sky, come to Narendra Modi app, come through MyGov, come by phone, come through recorded messages.
And whenever I find him out of time, I have a pleasant experience.
There are so many diversified information.
Every corner of the country has a lot of powers.
Like the seeker, innumerable contributions of people in society, on the other hand, perhaps the eyes of the government will not be seen, such problems also look at.
Perhaps the system may have become addicted, people too have become addicted.
And I have found that the curiosity of children, ambitions of youth, squeezing of elders' experience, things like that come out.
Every time the inputs come to talk about the mind, it has detail analysis in the government.
What kind of suggestions are, what are the complaints, what are people's experiences
It is usually seen that human nature is to advise others.
In the train, go to the bus and if someone coughs, then immediately come and say that do so.
Advice, suggest, as if it is in our nature.
Initially, when suggestions came about "mind", the words of advice were heard, reading, our team also felt that it would probably be a habit to many people, but we tried to look closely, then I really became so emotional.
Most suggestions are those people who try to reach me are those who actually do something in their life.
Something good is that he is trying according to his intellectual, power, strength, situation.
And when these things came to me, I felt that these suggestions are not normal.
They are out of experience.
Some people also suggest that they think that if this idea is working there, if other people listen and get a comprehensive form then many people can benefit.
And so their natural desire is that if it is mentioned in the matter of "mind."
All these things are very positive in my view.
I first of all, the maximum suggestions that are of karmayogis, are of some passing people for the society, I express gratitude to them.
Not only this, when I mention something, such things come in mind, then it is very pleasant.
In the last word "Mann", some people had suggested me ood waste, expressed concern about it and I mentioned.
And when mentioned, then on the Narendra Modi app, many people from many corners of the country on MyGov, how-how I
What have you used to save foodwaste with novative ideas
I did not even think that today, especially in our country, young and old, has been doing this work for a long time.
Some social institutions do, we have come to know for many years, but the youth of my country are engaged in it - this is what I later came to know.
Many sent me videos.
There are many places where the roti bank is running.
People deposit bread in their bread bank, deposit vegetables and those who are needy people also get it there.
The giver also has satisfaction, the taker has never to look down.
This is an example of how work is done in collaboration with society.
Today is the month of April, the last day is complete.
The establishment day of Gujarat and Maharashtra on May 1.
On this occasion, many good wishes to the citizens of both the states on behalf of me.
Both states have consistently tried to cross new heights of development.
Contributed to the advancement of the country.
And in both the states, the incomplete series of great men and their lives in every field of society continue to inspire us.
And remembering these great men, 2022 on the establishment day of the state, 75 years of independence, we should take the resolution of our state, our country, our society, our city, our family.
To prove that resolution, plan should be made and should move forward with the help of all citizens.
My two states have very good wishes.
There was a time when the climaate change was the subject of the academic world, the subject of the seminar lived.
But today, in the daily life of the people, we also experience, do surprise.
Nature has also changed all the rules of the game.
The heat that occurs in our country in May-June has come to experience this time in March-April.
And when I was taking people's suggestions on the matter of "mind", most of the suggestions that should be done during these summers, people have given me it.
Well all the things are prevalent.
It is not new, but still it is very useful on time.
Mr. Prashant Kumar Mishra, TS Kartik, many such friends have worried about birds.
He said that in the balcony, on the roof, water should be kept.
And I have seen that small children of the family do this well.
Once they come to know why they should fill these water, they go to see 10 times a day that there is no water in the utensils that are kept.
And keep watching whether the birds came or did not come.
We feel that this game is going on, but in fact, there is a wonderful experience of awakening these sentiments in the child mind.
You also see a little attachment to animals and birds feel a new joy.
A few days ago, Mr. Jagat Bhai has sent me a book from Gujarat, "Save The Sparrows and in which he has worried the number of sparrows that is decreasing, but what he has used for his protection in the mission mode. What have you done, very good description is in that book. "
Well, in our country, animals and birds, nature are talking about co-life with them, we are painted with that color, but still it is necessary that collectively such efforts should be emphasized.
When I was the Chief Minister in Gujarat, "Daudi Bohra Samaj's religious leader Syedna Saheb" had been hundred years.
They were alive for 103 years.
And his hundred years, Bohra society, Burhani Countt.
on had launched a huge campaign to save sparrow.
I had an opportunity to launch it.
Nearly 52 thousand bird eeders they distributed in the corner of the world.
He also got the place in Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, newspaper giving, milking, vegetable giving, postman, anybody comes from the door of our house, but we forget that there are days of heat, first ask for water.
Young friends, I want to do some things with you too.
I sometimes worry that many people in our younger generation enjoy lives only in Comort One.
Parents also reproduce them in a big defensive state.
There are some extremes, but most common one looks.
Now the examinations have ended.
Plans have been made to enjoy academy.
Summer vacation feels good even after summer.
But I want to talk about how your vaccation goes as a friend.
I believe some people will use and tell me.
Do you use this time of vacation, I give three suggestions, three of them are very good, but try to do one of the three.
See that new experience, try to take the opportunity of new skill, try that neither has ever heard nor seen, nor do you know, but still minds to go there and go.
New places, new exper.
Ences, new skills. Sometimes seeing something on TV or reading in the book or listening to acquaintances and feeling the same thing itself is the difference between the sky and the earth.
I'll urge you to try to know wherever you have curiosity in this vacation, make a new experiment.
periment positive, a little comfort is going to be taken out of one.
We belong to a middle-class family, belong to a happy family.
Do friends ever mind that without reservation, take a ticket in the second class of the railway, travel at least 24 hours.
What experience comes.
What are the things of those passenger, what they do after landing at the station, perhaps those who can not learn throughout the year, they do not get sleep in the 24-hour reservation, crowded train, standing and standing.
Sometimes experience.
I don't say this again and again, do it one or half times.
In the evening, take your football, take volleyball or take any means of sports and go to the poor town.
Play yourself with those poor boys, you see, perhaps you'd never have enjoyed the game in life - you'll get it.
When children who have passed such a life in society will get an opportunity to play with you, you have thought how big changes will be in their life.
And I believe I'll go once, I'll have to go again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many volunteer organisations work for service.
You are connected to Google Guru, look at it.
Join 15 days, 20 days with such organisations, go, go to the forests.
Sometimes there is a lot of summer camp, personality seems to be development, many types of development can be included in it.
But at the same time you think you have done such a summer camp, personally development course.
You have reached the people of the society without money who have no such opportunity and teach those who have learned.
How can you be taught them
I am also worried that Technology came to reduce the distance, Technologi came to end the boundaries but its adverse effect is that six people in the same house should sit in the same room but the distances are so much that can not imagine.
Why
Everyone's got somewhere more busy than Technology.
Collectivity is also a ritual, collectivity is a power.
Second I said that Skill, don't you mind you learn something new
Today is the era of competition.
There are so many drowned in the amination.
To get the best marks, they get lost.
There is no coaching class in academy, there is anxiety about the next eam.
Sometimes it is feared that the robot is not happening, our young woman is not living like a machine.
Friends, dreams of becoming a lot in life, good thing, the intention to do something is good, and should also do it.
But also see that the Human Element within itself is not getting frustrated anywhere, we are not going far away from human qualities
Skill development can put a little emphasis on this aspect
Trying to pass time with yourself, away from Technologi.
There are instruments of music learning, learning 5-50 sentences of a new language, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati Ho, Marathi Ho, Punjabi.
If there is a country full of diversity and look, then there can be some teacher in our neighborhood.
If the swimming does not come, learn swimming, drawing, even if the best drawing will not come, but try to put something on paper.
The sensation inside you will start to appear.
Sometimes we learn little work that we say, why not mind us
You want to learn car driving
Do you ever mind learning auto-rickshaw
You run cycle, but the three-wheeler cycle that people are taken - have ever tried to run
You see all these new experiments are such that these skills will also enjoy you and will expel you from what you have tied up in a realm or not.
Out of bo some guys.
This is the opportunity to make life.
You must think that all the Yeam will end, I'll go to the new halt of areer then I will learn that it will not be a chance.
Then you will fall into another hassle and so I will tell you, if you are fond of learning magic then learn the magic of cards.
Keep showing magic to your friends.
Try to know some things you don't know, it will definitely benefit you.
Human powers within you will get consciousness.
There will be a very good opportunity for development.
I tell my experience to see the world as much as we learn and understand, which we can not imagine.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages, new areas.
But before going, it is said to be practiced and going to see him like a curiosity, understand, discuss with the people, ask them if they try, then it will be enjoyed to see him.
You must try and decide not to travel more, go to one place and take three days, four days, then go to another place there for three days - four days, this will give you a lot to learn.
I would like and it is also true that when you are going, share me the picture too.
Have you seen a new one
Where were you going
You I
EncredibleI
Share your experiences using andia.
Friends, this time the Indian government has given you a great opportunity.
The new generation is getting almost free from cash.
He doesn't need cash.

Reer earn. Generally in our country I
There is an atmosphere of hate towards PCCulture but it is so deep - this has just experienced me.
When the government decided that now how big a person is in India, he will not roam on his car by putting a red light.
That's a way I
PCCCulture had become a symbol but the experience used to say that the red light looked on the vehicle, it used to look on the car, but gradually he entered the brain and brainly I
P culture has grown.
Now, for the red light, no one will be able to claim that the red light that has entered the brain has gone out.
I got a big interesting phone call.
Well, in that phone he has expressed the apprehension, but at this time there is so much guess from the phone call that the common man does not like these things.
He feels the distance.
"Namaskar Pradhan ji, I am speaking Shiva Choubey, from Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh.
I want to talk about Government's red beacon ban.
I read a line in Newspaper, in which Every I wrote
Andian is a I
I felt very proud to hear the PO on a road and I was glad that today my time is equally important.
I do not have to get trapped in traffic jams and I do not have to stop for anyone.
So I want to thank you very much for this decision.
And in this which you have launched Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, our country is not getting clear, from our roads.
The grandfather of the UP is also getting clear - thanks for him.
Going to the red light from the government decision, it is part of a system, but with our mind, we have to remove it with effort.
If we all try to make a conscious effort then we can go out.
New I
Our concept of Endia is that in the country I
PID at the location of POD
The significance increased.
And when I .
PIO instead of PDU
If I am saying, my feeling is clear - Very Person is Important - Every person has the importance, every person has the honor.
We accept the importance of hundreds of millions of countrymen, accept the memories of hundreds of millions, so how big will the strength be united to fulfill great dreams.
We all have to do together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that we keep remembering history, our cultures, our traditions, repeatedly.
It gives us energy, gets inspiration.
This year, we are celebrating 1000th birth anniversary of 100 million countrymen Sant Ramanujacharya ji.
For some reason, we got so tied up, became so small that they kept thinking for more and more centuries.
Century will be of great importance for other countries of the world.
But India is such an ancient nation that we have got an opportunity to celebrate thousands of years and thousands of years old memories in its luck.
How will a society a thousand years ago
How will the thinking be
Just imagine a little.
Even today, how much is the problem of breaking social trends.
How would it be a thousand years ago
Very few people would know that Ramanujacharya ji had a sense of evil in the society, there was a feeling of untouchability, there was a sense of casteism, a huge fight against it.
He himself embraced the society who considered untouchable by his conduct.
Hundreds of years ago, he had agitated for his temple and successfully entered the temple.
How fortunate are we that in every age, only great men have been born in our society to eliminate the evils of our society.
When Sant Ramanujacharya is celebrating 1000th birth anniversary, for social unity, there is power in the organization - we take inspiration from them to awaken this feeling.
The Government of India is also going to relay a stamp in memory of "Sant Ramanujacharya" on May 1.
I bow down to Saint Ramanujacharya, respectfully, I offer reverence.
My dear countrymen, there is another significance of May 1 tomorrow.
In many parts of the world, he is also celebrated as a Shramik Day.
And when talking about Shramik Day comes, Habour is discussed, Habourers are discussed, then it is very natural for me to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And very few people will know that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the facilities that the workers have received today.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Baba Saheb, I talk about Saint Ramanujacharya ji, then the 12th century Karnataka's great saint and social reformer also remembers "Jagat Guru Basaveshwar".
Yesterday I got an opportunity to go to a function.
That was the opportunity to inaugurate the collection of his commitment.
In the 12th century, in the Kannada language, he has kept deep thoughts about labor, workers.
In Kannada language, he had said - "Kaya Kave Kailas, that means - you can get Kailash's house from your hard work, i.e. the heaven is achieved by doing the work."
In other words, labor is Shiva.
I talk of Shramev-Jaite repeatedly.
I'm talking about dignity of labour.
I remember equally, the father and thinker of the Indian Mazdoor Sangh, who made a lot of thought for the workers, used to say such a Mr. Dattopant Thangri - On one hand, there was an idea inspired by Maoism that "The world's work should be one and Dattopant Thengdi used to come the workers, do the world one. "
On one side it was said - Forkers of the World Unite.
By taking the ideology from Indian thinking, Dattopant used to say Thangri - Workers Unite the World.
Today, when I talk about workers, it is very natural to remember Dattopant Thangri ji.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals worldwide.
The problems that the world is passing through today, violence, war, destruction, competition of weapons, when these environment see, then Buddha's ideas look very relevant.
And in India, Ashok's life is the best symbol of Buddha's journey from war.
My good fortune is that vesak day is celebrated by the nited nations on this great festival of Buddha Purnima.
This year it is happening in Sri Lanka.
On this holy festival, I will get an opportunity to offer reverence to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Their memories will get an opportunity to refresh.
My dear countrymen, in India, have always tried to move forward by taking this mantra together.
And when we all say development together, then it is not only within India - it is also in the global environment.
And especially for our neighboring countries.
Our neighboring countries are also with the development of our neighboring countries.
Many projects go on.
India will launch South-Asia satellite on May 5.
The capacity of this satellite and its amenities will help in fulfilling the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
Whether it is a matter of natural resources mapping, talk of tele-medicine, area of education or I
T connectivity, try to people contact.
This satellite of South Asia will be fully helpful in moving forward our entire area.
India has an important step to increase cooperation with whole South Asia - is precious sight.
This is a suitable example of our commitment to South Asia.
South Asian countries that South As
A Satellite is attached to, I welcome them all for this important endeavor, thank you.
My dear countrymen, heat is very much, handle yourselves, handle yourself too.
Very good wishes
Thank you
.
