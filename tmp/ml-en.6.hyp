Man Kee Bath 2018, the dear countrymen of August, Namaskar.
Today the country is celebrating the Raksha Bandhan.
A lot of good luck for everybody's sacred day.
Raksha Bandhan is believed to be symbol of brothers' mutual love and faith.
This festival is a great example of social harmony for centuries.
In the history of the country, there are many stories that have been corresponding to believe in one of the two different nations or religions.
In a few days, the birth anniversary was coming.
With the atmosphere, elephants, horses, teeth, Hare Krishna, Govinda Govinda are going to roam.
The joy of drowning in the presence of Lord Krishna is different.
In many parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra, our youths will start preparing for the celebration of the thieves.
Good luck with the heart of all the people and the parents.
Prime Minister Mother, Namaskar Ahm Chinmai, Bangalore University, Dasham Kakshayam Pathami.
Sir, the first Sanskrit day is stable.
Sanskrit language, Sarla, this is Sarve Vadanti.
Sanskrit language, vah-vah-vah, so much talk, Aphi Kurma.
It's a graceful sympathy.
Bhagini Chinmai.
Goddess Sanskrit problem is a great fascination.
I am very embarrassed with Chinmai to put forward a new topic of Mama Hardik's Good Came.
Friends, Raksha Bandhan and Shravan Purnima celebrate the day of Sanskrit.
I appreciate everybody who is engaged in growing this great spirit and bringing the common people.
All languages have their own greatness.
We are very proud that Tamil is the oldest language in the world, since the Vedic period, the Sanskrit language has played a very big role in the propaganda of knowledge.
The information related to all the fields of life is in the culture and literature.
It is science, trick, agriculture, health, astronomy, but architecture, but management, economic science, but environment...
.
It is said that even the spells of the Agol warmth also spread in our verses.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Matur village of Shimoga district of Karnataka are speaking in each other cultured language even today.
You'll be happy to know that you can make words in a cultured language.
Two thousand metals, two hundred pieces of sufficix, 22 subscribers can make unnumerable words in this language.
So in any minute, the minute emotion or the subject can be explained properly.
We'll use English studies to make sure what we're talking about.
Sometimes poetry and symptoms.
But in a few words, the cultured well-known people know that they can speak very literally.
And it's easy to understand that it is related to our soil, our tradition.
For example, to ascertain the importance of the guru in life: Ekampi literature , guru , disciple , prophecy , nasty , drama , yad-datha vahyanari Bhavet.
I mean, if a guru taught him a letter, there is no thing that the disciples will fulfil the guru.
We need to celebrate the teacher's day with this thought.
Knowledge and gurus are not valuable, not worthless.
The teacher has the responsibility of keeping the children's feelings perfect instinct.
The most impact of these can be seen throughout the life.
On the occasion of academic day, great thinker and our former President, Bharat Ratna, Dr.
Sarva Player Namorizes Radhakrishna.
His birthday country is celebrated as a teacher day.
I celebrate the teaching day of all the teachers in the country.
Together, your devotional attitude with science and education, students.
Dear people, our farmers who are hardly slaughtering come with new hopes.
Rainfall is comfortable for dry water bodies and trees in the horrific summers.
But sometimes there's a very catastrophe and a destructive waterfall.
In some places, nature has reached a situation that rains more than one place.
We've already seen that the horrific waterfall in Kerala has suffered a very serious way of life.
Today the entire country is with Kerala in this tragedy.
We're compassionate with those who lost their lives.
The sad families want to make sure they can't solve the lost lives, but the hundred and twenty-five Indians are mixing their shoulders in this grief.
I pray to those who are injured in this natural calamity as soon as possible.
I believe that Kerala will rise because of the enthusiasm and immense courage of the people.
The evils that endanger the dangers are unfortunate.
But we can see the scenes of humanity at a time.
Wherever the danger has occurred, it is done in Kerala but in any other state of Hindustan, in the district or region, in order to make life again normal, from Kachh to Kamarup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.
Every age and every territory have a share of itself.
The hardships of the people of Kerala are the most distressed, and they share their sorrows.
We know that the soldiers of the armed forces take charge of the rescue operations in Kerala.
They tried to save the people of the flood.
The air force is a navigator, but the army, B.

Eff also had a great role in rescue operations.

I'm supposed to take the fools' hard work.
They did a very important thing in this accident.
My.

R.
Effe's skills and their dedication have become a idol of respect for the effort to face the occasions and all the Indians to decide in a rapid way.
Yesterday was celebrating.
We can pray to the Hon'ble country, especially to Kerala as soon as possible and to speed up the development journey of Kerala.
I once wish to believe that the people of Kerala and the people of other regions who had suffered from the country are with you all over the country.
Dear people, this time Man Keebat's suggestions were examined.
The subject written by most people from the country was our favourite Atal Bihari Wazpai.
Kirti from Gasiaabad, Swati from Sonip, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapna Bannerji from West Bengal, from Katihar in Bihar, and many others including Aklesh Pande, Narayanmodi Mobile Apple and My Giovi, were requested to tell about the various stairs of the life of Atalji.
The country and the world of August 16 were sorry when they heard the death anniversary of Atalji.
14 years ago, the Prime Minister's elected nation.
In a way, for the last 10 years, he was away from active politics.
The news didn't take place, it wasn't appearing in public life.
The 10-year break is very big, but after August 16, the country and the world saw that the Indian ordinary people did not have a minute period of ten years.
What kind of love and respect were there with Atalji, how much sad the country spread, it shows his vast personality.
For the past several days, the country discussed good things about Atalji.
People remember him in the best roles of a good partner, a compassionate writer, a great admirer, a popular Prime Minister.
Employment, which means good governance, makes it a major subject, the country is always intimate to Atalji.
I want to touch the other side of the vast personality of Atalji today.
It's the political culture given to the country of Atalji.
Whatever changes he tried in the political culture, he tried to bring it into a ruin of governance.
That made India a great profit.
There will be great benefits in the coming days.
I'm sure.
India is bound to Atalji in the name of the first rulership of 2003.
This change made two prominent changes in Indian politics.
First, the size of the ministries in the states has fixed the limit of 15 percent of the total assembly seats.
Secondly, the limit determined by the prohibition law was one in three and it was made two in three.
At the same time, clear guidelines were made to negotiate the party.
For many years, political culture has been formed to build a magnificent ministry in India.
The big ministry was designed not to divide the departments, but to make political leaders happy.
Atalji changed it.
Waiting for his red money and resources.
And the ability to work.
It's a long vision of a man like Atalji.
Our political culture has grown healthy habits.
Atalji was a devoted patriot.
During his reign, the time of the budget was changed.
The budget was presented at 5:00 in the evening following the tradition of the British, because it was the time to start the Parliament in England.
In 2001, at the time of presenting the Atalji budget, it was changed at 5 o'clock in the morning and 11 o'clock in the morning.
A liberty was made by the Indian Flag Code during the regime of Atalji and in 2002 it was regime.
In general, there were departments in order to fly the national flag.
So he brought our life-loving triple flag to ordinary people.
How did you see Atalji bravely stepped into the fundamental change against the obstacles that took place in the election process and the resistance of the people in the country.
Likewise, there are discussions about the elections together in the country and the states.
In this case, people say the opinion of the opposite.
It's a good thing, good news about democracy.
For healthy democracy, good democracy, good habits, continuous effort to strengthen democracy, to move the sympathy with open mind, and to the artists.
I repeat the vision to fulfil his dream of developing and prosperous India, and I honor Alliance for all.
Dear people, when there's discussions about the parlment, there's all about obstacles, crafts and actions.
But if it's good, there's no big deal about it.
A few days ago, the conference of the Parliament ended.
In this conference you will feel happy to know that the production capacity of the world's population is 118 percent and 74 percent of the country's population.
Beyond the party's interest, all the members have spent 21 bills and 14 bills in the Lok Sabha as a result of trying to enhance the year-old conference.
This year's conference of the Parliament will be reminded of the celebration of social justice and youth.
In this conference, the great bills used for the youth and the following communities were disappeared.
For a couple of decades, the need to make OBC commissions like a dogma.
In order to ensure the rights of the following sections, the country has failed to make OBC commission this time, which has given administrative authority.
This revolt turns into a goal of social justice.
Politician, Bill has also been packed in this conference for the rights of the list classes.
This law will be more protective than the well-being of dogma groups.
And prevent the criminals from attacking them.
The mortgage fills in self-confidence.
There is no society of injustice and culture against women's power in the country.
The country is not ready to bear the culprits of rape.
That's why the Department of Public Penal Code has been pursued by the Bill, and the Department of Hard Penalties.
Those who do such evil will be punished for at least 10 years.
At the same time, less than 12 years of age, the girls who are blasphemed will be wounded.
You must have read in the newspaper a few days ago that the court of Mandsore in Madhya Pradesh was executed for two months quickly for the person who abused the unborn child.
Prior to this, a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh had completed the trial for five days and sentenced the guilty.
The court in Rajasthan took such a quick decision.
This law takes the best part in preventing crimes against women and children.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
Grandfather Bil was slaughtered in the world.
But it couldn't be pasaged at this conference of the territory.
I assure the Muslim women that the whole country stands with all the strength to rejuvenate them.
Assuming the kingdom, we can change the life of the poor and the oppressed.
In the year-old conference, everybody is having a good habit this time.
I'm grateful to all the partners in the country.
Dear people, the attention of millions of people is now focused on Asian Games in Jakarta.
Everyday in the morning, in the newspaper, in the television, during the news, which Indian player has been able to find in social media.
Asian games are still running.
All the players who receive the medal for the country are happy.
My good wishes for the rest of the competition.
Indian sports specially show the best performance in shooting and resting.
But our players are bringing medals in such unparalleled species.
Wushu, roving.
They're not just traces, but evidence.
The evidence of the skyscreen enthusiasm and dreams of the artists of India.
In those who get medals for the country, our girls have a lot of names.
This is a very positive sign.
Young players who get medal have 15-16 young men.
It is also a good sign that most of the medal sports live in villages and streets.
They have achieved this success through hard work.
We will celebrate National Sports Day on August 29.
On this occasion, I'm gonna enjoy good luck.
And Hockey magician Mr.
Dhyanchand is honored.
Of course I pray to the citizens of the country to play.
Take care of your own fitness.
Because healthy India is building a rich and rich India.
If India is a fit, then the bright future of India will be created.
I've been greeting those who received medals in Asian Games once more.
I hope the rest of the sports show a good effect.
Everyone has many good lucks on the National Sports Day.
Prime Minister, Namaskar.
I'm talking to Engineering student from Vision Tristrick.
The Prime Minister spoke to the students going to the college in the last Man Keebat.
You talked to the doctors and the Chartered Accountants before.
My request is to say something to the engineering students on September 15th engineering day.
It will increase the strength of everyone, we will be very happy, and we will be encouraged to do something for the country in the coming days.
Thank you.
Namaskar Bhavanaji.
I respect the idea of the child.
We've all seen building stones and houses used to be built.
But can you imagine the creation of an excellent, vast and miraculous temple of a mountain that was a single rock about 1200 years ago
Maybe it's hard to imagine.
But that temple is Kailasnath Temple of Ellora in Maharashtra.
About a thousand years ago, a 60 meter tall pillar of black rock was built, and there was a piece of approximately 80 tons of black rocks.
But the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamilnadu is so different.
This unbelievable equation of architecture and engineering can be seen there.
The staircase known as Rani Kewa, built in the eleventh century in the place of Pan in Gujarat, will surprise anyone.
India's land was the engineering laboratory.
The imagination of not imagining is that the engineers of India have shown examples of miracles in the world of engineering.
We have got a gem in our tradition of great engineers.
His acts are still miraculous.
He's the Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
Vishvesvaraya.
The Krishna Rajasagar dam built on the Kaveri river is still being used to millions of farmers and ordinary people.
He's a priest on that part of the country.
The rest of the country reminds him of very respect and self-confidence.
In his memory, he celebrated September 15th Engineers Day.
Following his legs, our country's engineers have shown their different personality all over the world.
When I told you about the miracles in the world of engineering, there was a terrible earthquake in Gujarat in 2001.
And then I was working there for a volunteer.
I had a chance to go to a village.
I had a chance to see a mother over 100 years old.
Look at me, you said it's my house.
- In Kutch it is called Bhunga - My house has seen three earthquakes.
I saw three earthquakes.
I've seen it later in this house.
Do you see anything wrong
This house was built according to the nature here, according to the weather...
She said it was very proud.
So I felt that before the centuries, the engineers of that period had made arrangements for people to be safe according to the environment.
Now, when we celebrate the Engineer's Day, we have to think about the future.
Workshops must be done there.
What are we going to learn new things in the changed times, what to teach
What do you want to add
Desister management has changed to a big deal.
The world is facing natural rages.
What kind of structural engineering should be in this condition
What's the course of that
What should teach students
How should the construction of the environment be psychological
How can the manufacturing of valuables for the manufacturing sector
How can the precaution be determined to build without dust
We have to think about many things like this when we celebrate an engineering day.
Dear people, the atmosphere of festivals...
With this, the preparations for Deepawali were started.
Let's get together in Manki Bay.
Let me tell you the mind...
Let's get together to lead the country with a heart.
You'll have many good lucks...
Thank you.
See you again.
