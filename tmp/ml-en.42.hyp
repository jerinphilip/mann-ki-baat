Prime Minister Mr.
On the 30th August 2015, the Tamilnadu language of the special launch conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population at 11 in the morning.
My favourite patriots.
You're my greetings.
I've got a chance to present things in your mind.
South Indians celebrate the Honor far away.
On this occasion, I celebrated the sacred festival of Raksha Bandhan all over our country.
The Government of India has implemented new schemes for social security to the common people.
All gentlemen have adopted these plans for a very short time.
In the sacred festival of Raksha Bandhan, I prayed for our sisters to carry out security practices.
According to my knowledge, 11 million families have been involved in these schemes.
About half a million mothers and brothers have benefited from this.
It's a good sign I see.
All the mothers and sisters celebrate the sacred festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, a year before I spoke to you, the people had given a bigger plan to the people.
Does it work for 60 years in such a short time
To implement these plans, all the government's components, all the banks, have joined the whole mind.
It won.
According to the information available so far, about 17.
74 million bank accounts are opened.
I saw poverty in poor people.
The priest Balance has to open accounts.
But the poor were supplied and composed to be 20,000 million.
The main source of the economy is in the banking sector.
Bank Mitrum Project has been designed to bring these Arpaths to the poor.
Today, more than a million bank mirrors are operating all over the country.
Young people have been employed by this.
You'll be very happy to hear that in a year the banking sector has made a million economic bombs to connect with the economy and the poor.
Open accounts don't stop.
Now many thousand people have the right to take overdraft in the scheme and benefit them.
The poor can provide money to the banks.
And there was no faith in them.
On this occasion, I once appreciate and wish to tell all poor siblings who have opened accounts in banks.
Never lose contact with the bank.
I put these things in front of you.
Now it's your job to continue with this relationship.
All our accounts must be very careful.
I believe you're gonna do it completely.
The events that took place in Gujarat in the past, the Tandava of Himsa made the countrymen restless.
If Gandhi and Sardawar walk on earth, they hurt our land and suffer.
But for a very short time, my well-known brother-in-law of Gujarat has controlled such situations.
In order to stop the situation worsened, a dynamic atmosphere was created and once again there was a way to peace and peace in Gujarat.
Peace and peace are the right paths of adventure.
We have to go together with the shoulders on the path of rehabilitation.
Our problems are the only way development.
In the last few days, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars in the Sufi tradition.
I've got a chance to hear what they say.
I've got a chance to listen to them.
It was like a music breaking in a way.
Their voices, their conversational style, that is, the generosity and gentleness in the Sufi tradition.
I've got all their feelings in these widows.
I thought it was nice.
Perhaps the world needs to take Islam's right form in a right way.
Sufi tradition is related to love, generosity.
I believe they'll send this message to the remote places.
You'll also have the benefit of the Manav Samuha.
Islam will benefit the society.
Whatever our religious rituals, but I want to tell others to understand the Sufi tradition.
I'll get a chance again in the coming days.
I'm lucky for this moment.
In many parts of the world, the scholar of the Buddhist tradition will come to Bodhgaya.
I'll discuss all the matters related to the human community.
I've got the invitation to participate in it.
I'm glad they invited me to Bodh Gaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru went to Bodhgaya.
With these scholars all over the world, there will be an opportunity to go to Bodhgaya.
It'll be a very pleasant moment for me.
My dear Krashak Jodri monsters, I want to tell my mind again.
I've already been consulted about these things.
You must have heard me in the parliment, and you'll have heard 'Man Ki Bath'.
It has been clear that every time the arguments about the land acquisition bill have been open in it.
The government's mind is open in such matters.
I'm ready to accept anything that protects the interests of the farmers.
It's been saying many times.
But today I have to tell my farming sisters that the alterations related to land acquisition bill have been received from the states.
Everyone felt like this.
If poor farmers want to be well-known, they must make the canals of water supplying the fields.
Electricity posts should be set up to reach the villages.
The villagers have to make roads.
The poor villagers have to build houses.
The poor young people in the village have to provide job opportunities.
So, we're gonna have to steal the laws under the superiority.
And then the development guarantees came.
Farmers have spread a lot of misconceptions in the shore.
I knew they were scared.
My dear farmer brother-in-law, you don't have to be afraid.
No one has given me such a chance.
As far as I am concerned, every thunderstorm rising in our country has its own importance.
But the height of the sounds in the farming people is particularly important.
We had an ordinance in the middle.
Tomorrow August 31 is going to end Ordiones.
I've decided to finish if the term ends.
I mean, the situation before my circus came into existence has now been re-established.
But one thing in it is incomplete.
There were 13 things done for a year.
That's why he started Ordinance.
Those problems are ruined by such discrepancies.
The Ordinance continues to end.
It was the best thing for the farmers.
There's something that gets straight from the economic scene.
Those 13 species, we're in the middle of the law today.
So farmers don't have any financial losses.
The law wasn't finished before 13 things were put in the middle.
They're finished today.
My farming brother-in-law, Jawan, Jai Kisan, I want you to bear it is not just a monster, but a spell of us.
That's what I said on Independence Day, the name of the Union Ministry of Agriculture will be called the Union Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture.
With that decision, the Circar has gone very fast.
My cruel sister-in-law, there are no mistakes.
Nobody scares you.
You don't have to worry.
I have another thing to say.
Two days ago, 50 years of war in 1965.
When I remember this war in 1965, Lal Bahadur Scientist is regular.
Along with this, Jai Jawan will remember his pride of Jai Kisan.
At the same time, it is absolutely natural to remember all the martyrs of India's Trivana flag and its significance and conviction.
I inspire everybody in the 65-year war victory.
The heroes are finished.
We're inspiring such prides of history.
Last week I had an opportunity to connect with the people of the Sufi tradition to talk to the leading scientists of the country for hours and listen to their opinions.
India is showing a graceful activity in the various fields of science.
I'm glad you.
Our scientists actually do important things.
How can such research be carried out by common people
How do you use these principles at the practical level
How can the laboratories be connected to Earth
Let's go ahead with the opportunity to bring these scientists to the common people.
I've got many new information.
I saw many young scientists shared their ideas with what adventure.
Whatever dreams they shine in their eyes.
These are inspiring about me, ignorant.
I told you that our students should lead to the science territory last Manki Bay.
I felt there was a lot of chances and chances after this discussion.
I once want to repeat the TV.
Every young man should be interested in science science.
Let's inspire students to our educational institutions.
My dear countrymen constantly write letters.
Someone from the 'Tane' of Maharashtra, MyGav.
I'm supposed to deal with the educational environment in India.
He put forward the guidelines related to the development of Napooni.
But, Mr. Chidambar of Tamilnadu.
Prakash Tripura invited attention to the needs of smart teachers for primary education.
He's given up for the necessary environment in the field of education.
I want to say something special to my dear young friends.
Because, in the Independence speech of the 15th August, I told you that the works at the bottom of the Red Fort are about Interview.
Interviews related to work have many kinds of complications for each other.
The employers of ordinary families, widows and maternal grandmothers, each of them has different types of slaves.
How will the Interview be, don't you need the surveillance for it, who can save
Who can win
There will be unconscious thoughts about every common man.
Everyone's gonna be for an interview later.
This is the result of the harsh corruption in the lower floor.
Interview, the common people will get a lot of relief.
That's why I shared my wish with the people on the Independence Day of August 15.
Interviews of all kinds of common jobs should be avoided.
I'm very happy.
It's only 15 days since August 15, that's why our circus moved very fast in a very short time.
In this case, the information about the execution has come out.
The decision has been taken.
Soon they'll be in power.
Interview may have lost many small jobs.
It's going on.
Ordinary people don't have to run for Shuparsha.
And the corruption that caused by it will be abandoned.
In the next few days, there have been many guests from all over the world.
It's our nation's stage for discussions on health sector.
India's plan to implement 24 world kingdoms together for the implementation of a plan to reduce the death rate of mothers and children.
It's not so small.
This kind of world kingdom is the first to gather outside the rich nation like America.
And there's no such competing in America.
But I'm trying to share a reality with you.
Today, in our country, it is a terrible and terrible matter that every 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children die during childbirth or after.
In the health sector, it's true that even though there were plenty of conditions.
It hurts us a lot.
If our achievements in the health sector are highly appreciated in the international region, we can't forget or forget our front counts.
Like our population polio's completely salvation, the tetanus has succumbed to the death of the mother and the child.
The world's health has been fully acknowledged.
But we have to save our mothers and children who are born.
Dear brothers, Dengu's terrible news is coming.
One thing must be remembered that 'Dengu' is terrible and dangerous.
But I don't.
It's easier to escape.
I have great significance here for the idea of 'supremacy' or 'Swachh Bharat' in front of you.
That's what we need to think.
We're watching and listening, without a left-handed media in the remote and other furnaces.
But it is true that you do not pay much attention .
We need a life that enjoys cleaning and cleaning.
You have to make sure yourself at home.
I'm supposed to be purified even for small things in the house.
We have to use pure water.
Home and flame must be authenticated.
There's a lot of information to the public.
But not enough attention has fallen into this area.
Sometimes it seems that we live in good houses with better facilities.
It doesn't recognize at times.
And that's why they invite 'Dengu' about water-related diseases.
Dear people, I want to tell you, we don't see death so expensive.
Life is so valuable.
Isn't it true that the use of unreasonable water and the delusion of cleanness
514 Free Testing Centres have been opened to protect 'Dengu' from different parts of our nation.
There is no doubt that the proper testing and proper treatment is possible to save our lives.
But it can't be done only by the government.
You need each other's co-operation.
We must give a lot of importance to cleanliness.
This is the case of Raksha Bandhan.
From Raksha Bandhan to Deepawali, there is a festival of festivals in our country.
Don't you change each of our festivals as a pure festival
Why don't you connect our festivals with pureness
Beloved, if you pay attention, purifying will change the nature of each of us.
Let's smile Dengue.
