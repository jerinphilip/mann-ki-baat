The voice of the mind, July 2018, folks, salvations.
There are reports of good rains in many places now.
In some places there are also reports of worrying species due to excessive labor, and in some places people are still living for rain.
The abnormality of India, the contemporaryity of India, from one side, sometimes rain cuts its burden.
But why should we say rain is less
Man himself is supposed to be a victim of nature
As a result, nature shows its anger sometimes.
That's why we should be lovers of nature, save nature, we should be responsible for telling the nature, then there will be a condition in nature itself.
The natural beauty that happened some days ago attracted the attention of the whole world, the human society.
In Thailand you will all be able to see a group of 12 boys swimming and a cave roaming around their boys .
It usually takes a few hours to get out of that cave.
But on the day the game of law was different.
When they reached a distance inside the cave , suddenly due to the obstruction of the cave the water was ruined in the mouth of the cave .
They're gonna get out of the way.
There is a small rocky rock inside the cave due to no absurdity, not a day or two, stayed for 18 days.
When death comes in front of the eyes, you're imagining how those chickens had the environment to spend each hour.
On one side, they were laughing at the humble, the rest of the human society was gathering together, expressing the humanity of God.
People from all over the world have been engaged in praying to bring these children out safely.
Where the kids are, at what stages they're engaged in all kinds of attempts to bring them out.
If the metabolism doesn't work properly, it'll be unable to save them until the season is over.
But as soon as he did good, the whole world was enjoyed, pleasant.
But there's only one thing that attracted me from this, that activity that was broken.
It's a wonderful thing to be responsible for every situation.
Everyone - the princes, the children's parents, their relatives, the publications, the citizens of the country - all showed peace and sure, unforgettable movements.
Everyone fulfiled the purpose of standing at the threshold.
I believe we have to learn, understand, see everyone handling the compliance.
It's not that the parents don't feel sorry, mother's eyes grow up.
But the psychological, control, the peaceful activity of the advertising society, all the things to be learned.
In these slaughtering acts, the Trekkkeeper was supposed to be a life sentence.
The world was very surprised to see that the boys did not lose their belief when they showed so much luxury and brightness in a dry cave full of water.
When human society stands together, we feel that the wonders are going on.
But it's necessary that we mark the plane from the peaceful, powerful, and its materials should be assigned.
In the past few days, our country's favourite poet Jewelz had left us all.
There's a significance in them - trust, self-confidence, psychology.
Jewelz will give us a lot of strength, enjoyment.
Some of his swords will surely go away, the bulls will hurt ourselves, if they're supposed to, then you'll surely get away.
Jewelz's calling them I'm honouring the priests.
He's the Prime Minister, the truth is my name.
I'm the first man in Delhi University.
During our school's general election time, I remember you spoke to us about the time of selection pressure, education.
What's the news you'll give to my students now
For the months of July-Oxt, farmers, the most important months for all the youth.
Because these months are the higher periods of colleges.
Millions of young people like Sathya get out of school and join colleges.
The months of February-March tests, audience, audience, the months of the month of the holiday, the choice of choice, the direction to travel in life, to decide what business should be done.
In the month of July, the cavity of the youth goes away from the winaks, on the cut-off, it's a very important period.
Students take care of the students away from their homes.
Students get away from Paddar's clutches and join professors.
I'm fully convinced that my young friends, colleges are very excited about starting life.
For the first time, leaving the house, leaving the village, leaving a safe environment, if it starts running yourself.
All these youngsters have evacuated their lives for the first time, to set a new direction for their life.
Many students are joining their colleges, some are inconsistent.
Be calm whenever I want to say in yourselves, feel your inner life fully, the books don't understand what is inevitable, it's important to read, and then make yourself the nature of looking for new things.
There's a different value for old friends.
It's a very intelligent activity that young guys are very valuable, even if new friends are chosen, habitual, communicating.
Can learn some new things, some new capabilities, new languages...
.
Those who went out of the house, studying somewhere, can hear those places, know about them, people from there, language, culture, tourist places.
Go to tourist places and get information about them.
My lives to all the young men who started the new ball.
If you talk about the college season, a student of a very deep family in Madhya Pradesh, Asharam Sautri has achieved success by crossing the difficult words of life.
He has been selected in the first attempt at the medical treatment of Jothpur Eyes Hospital.
Her missionary is coming to work in the underworld and convincing her family.
I'm supposed to convince him of my life for this success.
How many such students of the poor families have been slaughtering their immortal efforts to deal with the terrible circumstances.
It was Prince Kumar, son of a drive worker at the Delhi Travel Corporation, who studied the footsteps of the streets of Kolkata, chosen Afrien Shaket, a woman from Auto Rixa driving Ahmedabad...
..
.
Their achievements predict us that Kushi, a resident of Nagpur, is a drive in the school bus, is the father of Karthik, a resident of Aryan, who works in the brick shole of Jarkund's Ramesh Sahu.
Student Rameshekuk is selling sports in the festival.
Anushka Panda, a woman who has been converted to Kutka, is suffering from a spinal muscular atrophy from birth...
.
All of them, with the help of pessimism, made attempts to see the world back by those who have gained restrictions in their minds.
If we've seen around us, we're gonna know many such examples.
Any good event that runs in some corner of the country, fills my mind with the surge, gives me a sense of enthusiasm.
If Jewelz tells about these young men, I'm taking care of them, that's the meaning of life.
Jewelz's poems like to hear the singings of the snakes of the snakes and the snakes of the gardens of the swimming swimming away from the flowers .
My folks, my eyes went on a message a few days ago, were written in it that the two young men had weared the dream of the rope.
While studying it further expanded, it was realized how our youths used to technologically, intelligently and integrate technology, are busy trying to change the lives of human beings.
I've been talking to Indian youth in the city of San Jose, once known as the technology center.
I've asked them to think of how they can use your capabilities for India.
I would like to ask for information about how to use the foreign countries to come out.
Yogesh Sahu, two instructors of Rae Bareli, and Rajneesh Wazbei, they also took me into a new attempt by accepting this promise.
Using your professional capabilities, Yogesh made the work of SmartGaoon App, the intelligent villages.
This activity provides a way to gather the villagers with the world, to get any obligation, anything in your mobile.
Everyone used this activity to be aware of Rae Bareli's father-in-law, Panchayat leader, district judge, district ruler.
In this village of activity, a kind of degenerative revolution has come to understand.
Recording the development work in the village through this work, knowing about their progress, watching everything has become easy.
In this process, there are village phone calls, news details, programs list, medical center, information centers.
This work is very beneficial for the farmers .
The specialty of the work, explains the real value of the farmers.
It works in a way as a market for their products.
If you see this present, we have to absorb that these young people live in America, living there between lifestyle, ideas.
Several years ago, even after leaving India, your village has been deliberately identified, understands the words, are emotionally linked to your village.
Because of this, it's possible to understand the needs of the village.
The thirst of your village, your roots, etc. is natural for every Indian to show any slave for your motherland.
But sometimes this feeling is faded because of the time, the distance, the environment.
If you're supposed to drag it, this feeling brings them back to their own days, to the end of the day.
We can't see the inner conditions, conditions, distances, we've never learned any of ourselves.
Look, sure, guys
Call them "Freedom Prime Minister."
I'm talking to the Santosh Cocktay, from the Colapur of Maharashtra.
The ancient tradition of Maharashtra is the Vari of Pandharpur .
Every year it is celebrated with great enthusiasm and interest .
Only 7-8 lakh devotees participate in it .
You're gonna have to give information about this very different arrangement that all the people of the country should know about it .
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It's really a miraculous trip to Pandapur's Warrie.
Friends, the Olympic Month Academy was the 23rd of July.
Every year Bandarpur is celebrated very specially .
The pious city of Pandapur in Solapur district of Maharashtra .
On the occasion of Oudh academy only 15 - 20 days before Varkari meaning travellers come to Pandrapur along with teeth .
This journey is called Wari.
Lacs of devotees participate in this .
Gyaneshwar Swamis , Tukaram Swamis , keeping the adornments of the globes in the turban, playing vetel-ville, walking towards Pondarpur while singing vachanas.
This barricade of education, culture, illness.
Tirthankars come there to visit Vietoba or Panduranga .
Vital God's evils, repeated, protected the welfare of the affected comrades.
The devotees of Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Andhra Pradesh , Dhelangana are filled with devotion and devotion .
To go to Vitoba temple in Pandapur, its excellence, beauty, spiritual joy are all unique experiences.
If you get the chance, I'd like to leave the Hoover Nears of the mind, I'd like to experience the Punderberry once.
Gyaneshwar swamis , Namadeva , Aknath , Ramtas swamis , Tukaram swamis , Mahanas are still being guided by the people of the literature of Maharashtra .
The tradition of these greats in every corner of India is enlightened by the expertise of fighting against blindness.
We get the greatest news about the importance of Parot singing, disappearing, compassion, affection and brotherhood.
There is an open mantra to fight socially against irritation.
They sometimes suppressed the society, boiled, enlightened the crooks of it.
Conscious of ourselves to be natural, equitable, pure.
Our land of India has achieved many gems.
The great tradition of the great mahas who enjoyed themselves on the slope of God was in our country, and in the donkeys of the Bharat Mata there were also great men who dedicated themselves to their innurity they had visited her.
Such a great man is Logmanya Dilkar.
They have written a sword in the mind of many Indians.
On the 23rd day of July we celebrate the birthday of Dilkar , on the 1st day of August , his memorial is celebrated .
Logamanya Dilkar is full of self-confidence.
The mistakes of the British rulers were straightened by the jungle , power and buddhism .
It wasn't a small thing, but it wasn't.
The glorious event that connects his sword idol in Ahmedabad and I want to be fought with the people of the country today.
1916, October...
.
During that period, when Logamanya Dilkar came to Ahmedabad, more than 4,000 people had offered him a visit to Ahmedabad before 100 years ago.
During this journey, Sardar Brahmin Boat got the chance to talk to him.
Circular Brahmin Boatel, Lookmanya has attracted a lot.
On the 1st day of August, 1920, when Luxmanya Dilkar disappeared, he confirmed that he was a memorial.
When Sardar Baptel Boatel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipality, he immediately chose the Victoria Carden by the name of the England ueen who made the memorial of Lookmanya Dilkar.
Initially the British had discovered this activity, so the rulers continued to repeat their permission.
But Sardar, aren't they, Sardar
Well, if you want to lose his position, Sardar explained that Luxmanya Dilkar's mirror idol was built there.
In the end, the idol of the surrounding idol was ready, who took it on the 28th day of February, 1929
Sardar Boatel, who opened Gandhiji's bravery.
The most comfortable thing is that after the inauguration of Gandhijis, Sardar Boat, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation did not get only a good man, but it was due to which Dilkar's miracle idol could be built.
My favorite folks, the glory of this monument idol is very incomparable, in which they are seen sitting in the chair.
The self-esteem is engraved under that genius...
.
I'm talking to you about the age group of the British.
Because of the efforts of Logamanya Dilkar, the tradition of celebrating social fervor is very interesting.
It has become an intelligent instrument to lead the feelings of social awareness, competitiveness, comprehensiveness, equality, brotherhood, etc............................
Conflicted in the struggle against the British, these dwellings were tolerate the royal, communal restrictions, guided to unity.
The fame of these dragons for the time has been increasing.
In our ancient tradition and historical genius of our valor, we can understand that there is a great attraction in our small society even today .
Today in almost all the streets of many cities we can see the bundles of worshipping goddesses .
The families living in the native area make arrangements for it all together.
These works are joined as a team.
It's a golden opportunity for our youths.
Here you can acquire properties like head compassion, administration, which we can get more disturbed.
My favorite folks, I've been asking for the last time, even if I remember the Logamanya White...
..
This time also we celebrate Ganesh festival , celebrate with great fanfare , but we want to celebrate Ganesh Festival in a favourable manner .
I wish all the things should be natural for the surroundings of Ganesha starting to decorate the mood.
I'd like to propagate the popular generosity of the environment in every city ahead of the Generator Festival, in which the gifts will be given, the MyGov in the MyGov gallery and the NorendramodiAp should also be spread about popular genitals.
I must take your opinions to the people.
The Logamanya Dilkar awakened the self-confidence of the folk, the mantra - self-esteem is the genius, it's meant to reach.
Every Indian has to be accumulated with good luck, development lovers.
This is what makes new India.
50 years after the birth of Dilkar the same day that on the 23rd day of July the birth of another Satputra of Bharat Mata was born .
They sacrificed their lives only for the folks to breathe free air.
I'm telling Chandrashekhar Asad about them.
Whatever dreams of India are not interested in these observations , the thirst of our hearts lays in our hearts , you can see the coolness of the people .
These poems are poetry for many youths like Ashfakulla Kan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Asad.
Chandrashekhar Azad's evil, freedom humiliation, and his mentality also enjoyed many youths.
Asad kept his life rich, but he didn't even head for another rule.
In Madhya Pradesh Chandrashekhar Azad had achieved a huge impression to go to Alirajpur .
In Allahabad , Chandrashekhar Azad Garden also got a great deal of dedication to the monkeys .
Chandrashekhar Asad, however, did he not like the gardeners of the princes - if he lived to fight for freedom, if he died, he would be free to die, this is his specialty.
Once again these two great saints of Bharat Maa - Lokmanya Dilkar , Chandrashekhar Asad , both of them are observing my memories in the battlefield .
A few days ago, in the 400 meter runway of the Commonwealthy Madeen in Finland, Hema Tas, the daughter of the farmer, has been trying to win gold.
Akta Bayan, another woman from the country, has written my letter through the glimpse of Indonesia, now she is ready for Asian sports competitions.
"If there is a very important depth in the life of a valor of a valor, it's only to capture the silver flags in the world stage, which I've been showing it to give me a lot of humor."
Ekta, we're all grown up thinking of you.
You're proud of the country.
Tunisia has won the world-class Grand Prix in 2018 Aktan Gold, White.
His mission is that he changed the word of change as a means of his success.
Because of the road accident in 2003, Akta Bayan, even if the lower parts of his body were disorganized, he didn't lose heart, took up the ideal level, making himself stronger.
And a changeful capable Yogesh Kadunia has made a world-profile competition for the changing capabilities in Berlin city - in Grand Berry, winning the rest of the world.
Besides, Sundar Singh Kurjar has also won the humor in the competition to gather.
I'm supposed to convince them, Yogesh Kadunia, Sundar Singh, who deserves all the self-confidence and thirst, lives.
You're gonna have to move further, and play, kiss up.
My folk folks are one of the many events of the month of August history.
But due to the weather sometimes the diseases also go to the houses .
For all of you, for the sake of your special health, for the month of August, for many decades, I've lived a lot of lives.
Once again, we must meet in the church of the mind.
Thank you very much.
