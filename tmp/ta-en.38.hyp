On 15th day, the swinging of the Monkey Bath program - the voice of the mind, the people of the country, please me for all of you.
It's my voice of a lot of heart in 2015.
The next voice program will be held in 2016.
Now we're enjoying the festival of Christomas, now we're waiting for the New Year.
India's rich countries, here are rich with adventures.
There's another one coming as soon as one passes.
If you look at it, you can say that every minute leaves the neglect of the next event whenever it comes.
Sometimes it can be said that the economics that will be finished by India's plans.
They are absorbed due to the economic activity of people under the community.
In this view, the people of the country are demonstrating the lives of the Christomas festival, and the life of the coming year 2016.
In the year 2016, bringing all your enjoyment and joy, new joy, new sweetness, new sympathy, all your new peaks.
Get rid of the confluences all over the world.
The world's warmth, the world's warmth, the natural behaviour, the confluence caused by man.
From all these survivors have to live peaceful lives of human society - what can be the greater pleasure than this
You all know I'm fully using technology, don't you
Through this, I'm getting the information gathered.
I'm gonna take care of my comprehensive library called mygov.
Ganesh V from Pune city.
Chawla Savarkar is the tourist season of this season , in the large number of international and foreign tourists come , people go for many times for churches .
In such a way we pay attention to almost all the points depending on the tourism sector .
But wherever the tourists are interested, at those places we don't pay our special attention to cleaning, we have to pay that attention.
The amount of our tourist spots that are clean, that amount of India's idea and pattern that others get swollen in their minds, I will welcome Ganesh's views.
I'm taking Ganesh's ideas into the middle of the people.
When we came to believe that we should see guests as gods, we're gonna come home, we're sorry, clean, don't we
Similarly, we must keep the tourist places of our country, centers, tourist places clean and clean, in which we need to make a special effort.
It gives me enjoyment that there are colors coming from Nadenglu about cleanliness .
On the first day I've been a color of my appreciation for the public sector friends about this matter.
Because they're gonna visualize small, good things.
Dilip C in the village of Bhojpura of Madhya Pradesh state Sihore district.
Malviya, they're a simple artist.
He's done a good job at the time he's got a message about him.
In the village, if someone gives the artistic objects, he has ensured that the construction of the toilet does not get the necessary administrative call.
Freely, he's coming to work in the architectural work and finished the toilet.
I've only learned that this work was very sacred that in the village of Bhojpura, it was now that I would like to take care of you that they had finished only hundred dresses with their work.
I'm Tip C.
Malviya's demonstrating my life and my psychological appreciation.
There are reports of excitement about the country coming in our ears sometimes.
But in this country, millions of Tilif C.
The palaces are.
They're bringing you good work to stay here.
It's yourself the strength of the country
This is yourself the country's neighbourhood
These things take yourself to the progressive way of meeting
That's why Tip C in our mind's hole.
Appreciating Malviya, it's gonna be a natural one.
The country's very rapid progress has been found due to uninterrupted efforts of many people.
There are 125 crore people of the country who are skins and skin walking on the progressive road , meetings are also progressing .
Special education, talented capacity, chances of growing work.
Citizen's co-operation plans, bank facilities, commercialization of international levels, establishment of new industries, etc. are on one side.
The simple family members who are unable to go near the banks can now be obtained easily through the Mutra program .
Nowadays Indians have begun to understand that the milk of yoga art has begun to attract .
When the whole world celebrates the International Yoga Day, we all felt how important our country was, didn't it
This feeling will happen to us only when our thoughts and thoughts are in large quantities.
When he opens the mouth of his mother Jesus, who can forgive her asshole, where she finds her supernaturals
That's when she's visualized.
Similarly, Yoga is the day of India 's importance to Indians .
Always the sympathetic sympathies come in front of every house.
It's increasing the participation of the citizens.
The city dwellers using the facility of electricity cannot even imagine how many villages' feelings are the first to get electrical joints since all these years after independence.
Central State governments have also come to work in the earlier stages.
But with the name of the villages collected by electric power within thousands of days, the messages of encouragement and pilgrimage of the people of that village have started coming everyday along with the name of electric collected villages.
I'm sure even though the messages about these are not exposed in large numbers, I'm sure the communications are going to those villages.
They enjoy the pleasure and the joy that took place in those villages .
This is also the biggest thing that the government officials, who are engaged in the work of providing electricity to those villages, are the most important thing that is a farmer, poor, imaginative, mother-in-law, they are a reason for a frenzy of their lives.
Wouldn't you like to get this message all these people who didn't get electricity till date
I don't have to tell you what the government did, what it did, if people have the right to get it, they shouldn't leave it.
Shouldn't they even have information to get your rights
We all have to make sure how many people should get the right information, good things, things that help the common people, so many people should get it.
Is this your service too
I've been engaged in a small scale effort to get involved in this service.
I can't do all alone, isn't I
But when I say about it, wouldn't I give my part to me
A simple dweller can also join me by granting an APP named Narendra Modi in his mobile phone.
In this I'm gonna get rid of the easy things.
It's a matter of joy to me that people also share me with all kinds of things.
You must also take this effort on your own.
125 crores of people, how can you join without your help
Come, let's get involved in things related to the welfare of the common people, bring things together, and give them preference to their funny things.
My little friends, on the 15th of August, I've emerged Startup India, Stand Up India from the Red Fort.
After that all the departments of the government were finished in this regard .
Can India be the capital of Start up
For this, the production sector, the service sector, the farming sector, the new methods, new ideas, the new startups for the youth should be a golden opportunity in our respective states.
The world doesn't grow if newcomers don't exist.
Startup Andia, Standup Andia, brings a great opportunity to the small community.
My young friends, on the 16th of January, the Indian government's start up andia is beginning with the full swelling of Standup Landia.
A picture related to how it's going to be, will be put before you.
In this program, the Indian Technical Corporations, Indian Reservation Corporations, Central Council Corporations, National Technical Corporations, are all small communities, they all will be connected by the Leve Connectivity, that is, through direct communication system.
Startup is that the digital world is not sure that there's only a start up idea about those who have information technology.
We have to make changes in it by taking India's requirements black.
For example, when a poor man gets engaged in work, he gets too tired.
But if I say that a young man had made a new discovery helpfully from this fatigue, then I believe this is also startup.
I'm asking you to help those youngsters that you should help.
Help clothes, I can tell you that it has a market.
The intelligence capability of our young television spreads even in Nadeng.
There is an unprecedented capacity in the youths of India having ripped their nose.
They need only one chance of all.
This start up andia, standup andia, shouldn't be left in some cities, it should be spread without rotting the cords of India.
That is why we have to go ahead with this scheme and go to all the State Governments .
On the 16th day of January , I must be dealing with you in this regard.
I'm waiting for your superior ideas.
I'm young guys, the birthday of Swami Vivekhanander on 12th January.
There are millions of people in this country like me.
All of them have come from Swami Vivekananda Adarsh Purusha.
From the year 1995 to the 12th of January we will celebrate Swami Vivekananda Jayanti everyday .
This year from 12th January to 16th January this festival is held in Chhattisgarh Raipur .
This program is celebrated with a concentration of black money.
This year's darkness is very amazing, the contribution of Indian youth in Devalopment, Skill and Harmony of Indian Youth, that means progress, competence and well-being.
More than ten thousand youths from the corner of India will make a small level of India here.
Here the vision of the small India is expanded.
In a way, there's an opening of the sword of dreams, the survivors.
Is there any advice given to you regarding this young festival
Especially I'm asking my little guys to send your ideas directly to me through my Narendra Modi App.
I want to know, understand what's in your mind.
I'm sending these national youths to the fair to the concerned people.
Friends are waiting for the narendra modi apple for your opinions about this young fair.
Dilip Souhan, a part of the Gujarat state's Ahmdaba, has a change in vision power.
He sold the Accessible India Day at his school.
He had his feelings with me through the phone.
Sir, we followed the accident launch in our school.
I'm a change-powered teacher without vision.
I've talked about the capacity to change only 2000 children, how can they be aware of how they can help, students accepted it very well.
It made us enjoyment, students thought it would help change powers.
That's why you're on this great side.
Thank you very much, Tilif.
You're coming in this area too, you know well about this.
You've also met magnificent places.
Sometimes when we meet humans like him in our lives, the ideas in our minds run.
The eye on humans like these will be exposed on the basis of our ideas.
Your body parts are lost due to some accident.
Some people are born in the same way as the body part of the body.
As a symbol of human beings like these, the use of many kinds of words has come from the world.
But sometimes these words came to an end.
Some words appear to be not right to us too.
Handicapped at a time that the words of the bodily unhealthy were brought in, sometimes the word "disabled" was used, sometimes specially abled person, specialist skilled person.
I don't doubt the words have a significance.
This year, when the Government of India started the Commonwealth India scheme, there were arrangements for my participation in it.
But in some districts of Tamilnadu, especially because of the horrific floods in Madras, I had to go there, I couldn't participate in this event.
Even if I couldn't participate in this event, I was thinking about it.
God has given some disadvantages in the body of some, we call them sick.
But when we have a direct connection with them, if they know the disadvantages in shape, God can see them give them a great, special power.
Even if the sides don't know the potential, they'll be surprised to us.
That's why we worked in my mind that they shouldn't call the Divya talents, devil organs, change powers.
In the beginning of the smooth India campaign, the original and virtual structures have changed, which are formed in the helpful types of ability to change.
In all types of schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, easy-connected vehicles, lifts, free language letters, all kinds of simplifies, technical requirements, structures needed, understandable.
We're doing this shit.
We're getting people's participation in this.
You can't try this way too
I'm the people of the country
The government's plans will continue to be colored, working colors.
But the plans must be alive.
The plans must be activated with life till those who stay in the market.
Don't let them rot in the whips.
Isn't it possible to make plans for jewelry and bullshit
A few days ago the attempt was made to find the beneficiary how to bring the resources of the project in a simple manner .
Our country has been awarded the humiliating population of the burning syndrome.
It costs millions of rupees.
But there's no case for this.
Maniam has made a small change in the government's manufacturing to know whether he's going to the real opponents or not.
With the support of their bank account, base leather etc., these deposits go directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through the world's largest straightforward monetary project.
In such a way, it has got place in the world's achievement list to call the world's largest straightforward manifestation program.
This plan is lying down in the name of Bhahal.
In the month of November , only 15 crore people are the followers of the Bhahal Awali Yojana .
These 15 crores of beneficiaries go directly to the bank deposits.
Intermediaries, Sipariso, it's happening without any possibilities.
On one side, the operation of the base symbol, the opening of Jane's bank account, on the other hand, the central state governments jointly prepare the list of the followers, which are continuously being linked to the base symbol, bank deposit etc.
Mahatma Gandhi National Development Planning Project provides employment in MGNREGA villages .
There were colors of crimes that came in connection with this plan.
In many places, the bank accounts of businessmen who have worked are being put directly.
The students also came to the place to get education support population .
The criminals came from.
Even now, the scheme of directing the support population has begun, gradually it will be further advanced.
Till now, only 35, 40 schemes have been put up to Rs 40,000 crore directly in the bank accounts of the followers.
I have a golden penny on the 26th day of January, for the Indian royalty.
This time, the company of our country's capital law, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambatkar's 125th birthday is a very pleasant composition of this day.
In the court, two days were also organized for special arguments on the political constitution of the law.
It was a very nice experience.
All the parties, all the members, have been involved in arbitrary debates related to the piousness, museum, proper understanding of the political constitution.
We have to move it forward.
Can you see ways to connect with the people's constitution within the President's Mr. Day
Can you connect the structures to the public
Our political constitution gives us authority.
People necessarily argue about the authority, so it must be argued.
In the same case, the political structure is legally pressurized.
But when talking about the treasures, the voices shout and shout.
During the elections, most of the advertisements are open, written on walls, papers will be placed.
We'll talk too much about all the treasures in the legislatures.
But why don't you talk about the same treasure in the daily life
This year, when we celebrate Baba Saheb Ambatkar's 125th birthday festival, we can arrange a consequence of 26th of the month of January, in schools, colleges, our villages, towns, in many communities, in the community, in the compositions, poetry competition, narrative competition etc.
125 million people, whenever they're supposed to be slaughtered, see how big architecture has been inflicted.
But first you start talking about it
There's an idea in my mind.
Can we write to me before the 26th of January, Duty, your mother-in-law, Hindi, English or somebody's article or poetry
I'm supposed to know your ideas.
I'd like to know what my country's young headlines think about the cross-border, send it to this observation called mygov.
My mind thinks a little bit of advice.
On 26th January, when we celebrate the presidential trinal, by the citizens, through school and club students, the graceful idols of the folk leaders in our city, cannot be decorated very specially by circulating the places that surround them
I didn't say this to the government.
I'm putting the blackness in the form of citizens that can do it.
If we feel immensely in keeping the idols of the leaders of the grave idols, then we show the urge to recite those idols.
Can't we continue to purify the kind of country even in a society
This is the 26th day of January that we will join us in this effort.
Through this, honourable, sacred, surrounding idols of the kingdom of the kingdom will be made cleaning, all that will be activated by the public, by the citizens, naturally.
I live the Buddhist Year of 2016 once again, in the people of the country.
Thank you very much.
