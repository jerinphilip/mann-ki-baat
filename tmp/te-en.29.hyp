Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi 25 in Akashwani.
90.
Men Ki Bath, who participated in the 2016 narrative, is full of favourite sympathies, namaskaras.
A few days ago, our country lost 18 heroic sons in the attack on the Uri sector of Kashmir.
This hero is greeting all the soldiers.
I'm crazy.
Some of these events have been communicated with the whole country.
The country is poisoning.
Across along with it.
It's not the only damage done to the families of the dead soldiers.
Maybe one of the boys died in the war that took place with rapists.
One might have lost his life
A wife may have lost her husband.
This loss is a real country.
So, I'm telling all the Indians the words of the day.
The misdeeds are certainly sentenced.
Love my country, we believe in our army.
They dissolve every such kitchen with their persecution.
125 crores of people in the country show our soldiers a miraculous atrocities as peaceful living.
Look at our army, we're gonna miss.
Christians find us, political leaders, many times to express their views.
We also get the chances to express our views.
We express our views.
But... don't relax
Displays his persecution.
I spoke specially to the Kashmiri people this day.
The people of Kashmir are identifying the anti-national forces.
Don't know what they're true.
Such rebellions are moving away from the path of peace.
The parents in every family think schools, colleges work at the full level.
Farmers are also expecting their crops to move quickly, economic activity.
In the past few days, all the activities are running better.
We all know.
Peace, equality, honesty.
We know that solutions to all these problems.
This is our way of progress too.
For those of the first stages, we have to climb new peaks in development.
I believe we find solutions to all the problems with mutual discussions.
In Kashmir the development path of the foremost stages is explored.
And the best way for the emotional people is also known.
Kashmir is the responsibility of the security of the citizens.
The government has to take several actions to monitor peace security.
I'm asking security forces to use our power, power, laws, rules for safety.
The common people of Kashmir are trying to live with happiness.
That's why we must be with sure.
People who think differently about our thoughts also express new ideas.
In the midst of this, I got a chance to know many things in social ways.
From all the roots of India there is a chance to understand the feelings of people of all classes .
That's what supposes democracy.
A few days ago, a young man named Harshavarthan told me some different things.
He's very crazy.
I'm dead for the attack on Uri's grave.
I thought something had to be done.
But, didn't touch anything.
What can a normal student like me do
There's a thought that I use the way I use for the country's hit.
Think about it.
I'm supposed to study three hours a day.
I thought the country wanted to be a good citizen.
Rashed like this.
Brother Harshavarthan
At such a young age you thought so healthy during this axe gave me enjoyment.
But Harshavarthan.
I'm telling you something else.
This incident should be said to be so valuable that the country's survivors in the minds of the people.
It's an indication of the consciousness of our country.
This axis is very thoughtful to do something.
You didn't express it before me in a constructive way.
You'll have to know.
When the war took place in 1965, Lal Bahadur Shastri empowered our country.
That's the kind of axis all over the country.
That Akrosh is patriotic.
Everyone thought it was to do something.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri tried to make the country a glimpse of the people's mood.
Then he gave the mantra of 'Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan' and gave good inspiration to all the citizens to manage their duty for the country.
Bombs, guns, and every citizen has the chance to express otherwise.
Lal Bahadur Shastri used such an accident.
Mahatma Gandhiji also successfully tried to inspire it as a constructive path when the movement was a rapid form during the day of the Swatanya Sangram .
All the forces must determine their responsibility.
People in government should also decide their duties.
The Indian citizens should carry out a more constructive program with the feeling of a patriotism .
That's why this country will call the new peaks.
My country's favourite Vasulara, T. to Narendra Modi's app.
S.
The person called Karthik sent the message.
He said that the courage of our players in Paralinpix is marvellous.
In the message sent to the app, the person named Varun Vishwanathan also praised the sportsmen rose perfectly.
Don't ask you to touch this matter in 'Man Ki Bath'.
Not yours.
Every person in the country has a humorous feeling towards our players participating in parallimics.
In Parallimpics our sportsmen have put a human philosophy in us with magnificent skills.
We have completely changed our opinions towards the tourists.
When we got the letter to our nephew Deepa Malik.
I won the oppression by gaining this sequence, "I don't forget my words after she's fascinated.
This time in Paralinpix, 19 players accompanied by three women from our country.
In comparison to other sportsmen, the physical ability to perform during the sports, the skills of the sportsman stood a symbol of strong will, compelling power.
This thing you all know will surprise you too.
Our sportsmen won 4 tables with wonderful performances.
There are two golden layers, one rajata pattern, one blanket.
Debendra Jharia, who won the golden shrine, is the reason for us.
He won again after 12 years.
The age grows in 12 years.
Enjoyment also decreases once the golden thread is won.
But even when the age grows, the physical ability decreases.
Devendra represented that the power of the vision could not be lost.
Twelve jacks were brought after.
He's not a man from birth.
A hand was locked when the carant shot.
A man found gold at the age of 23.
The same guy found another golden line at the age of 35.
Think of how much you did for that.
Maryappan Tangve has won the golden line in Hayjump.
These fugitives lost their right hand at the age of five.
He couldn't even stop his vision power.
The man who lives in the city of the city.
Not even a middle class.
At the age of 21, there are many perverse conditions.
Even accelerating physical taste.
With the magnificent vision power, our country was defeated.
Deepa Malik also repeated many successes in the sportsmanship with marvellous ability.
Varun ci.
In the Bhatia High Jump, the Kansya Date was found.
He's so much he's working to get the address in Paralinpix.
In our country, in our society, so many of our brother-in-law's brother-in-law, we come to remember these letters that came to us.
They've grown honoured, glorifying.
In Parallimpics, only a few people know about this time showing magnificent material.
A few days ago, there were ordinary games in the same place.
Nobody could imagine all the records of the General Agencies were slaughtered for the first time.
This time it happened.
Abdel Latif Baker 1 of Algeria's competitive record of the golden records.
In 7 seconds, 1500 meters ran and created a new record.
Not so much.
A sportsman who found the 4th place in the tourists didn't find any address in the run.
But the simple sports finished the run in less time than the golden sportsman.
It surprised me.
I'm telling you a lot of appreciation for all the players again.
In the coming days, our country will run a magnificent plan to achieve more wonderful success in parallimpix.
Lovely my country, Vasulara, last week, I've experienced marvellous experiences in the new year of Gujarat.
It's a good minute to run me.
There the Indian government has arranged a big camp for the tourists.
That day many world records were created.
Where I got the chance of being a fetty with a little girl Gouri Shardul, who didn't see this legend.
This chicken came from the remote forest area of Nang district.
Ramayana is the most rigid place for these little children.
She made a good art, explained to me many things.
If I hear those things before them there, I'm surprised.
On the same day there's a chance to distinguish a book.
It's the book describing the success of the tourists.
It gave inspiration to all the events.
The Central Government has created world records for the next time.
These are very wonderful things.
Within 8 hours, 600 people who lost their sleeping instruments climbed into Ginny's Book of Records.
One day the creation of world records closed by the colonists is the reason for our country.
Lovely my country, Vasulara, on 2nd October, two years ago, we started the 'Swachh Bharat Mission' during Gandhi Jayanti.
That's the clarity in my context that I said we need a frequency in our nature.
Let's turn into every man's duty.
Everyone must despise the unconsciousness.
That's what I said to create the weather.
Initiated this group, it lasted two years.
I believe that awareness of cleanliness among 125 crore people in the country has increased.
Awareness has also increased among the people.
I said "a step towards cleanliness".
Let's say everybody try to put one step ahead.
I mean, 125 crores of feet are supposed to be clean.
It's so nice.
This way is clear.
If you work for a while, you know how many results are available.
But general citizens.
Build the governments or employees.
Give me government offices.
Don't leave the road.
Bus stand, railway station, schools, colleges, temples, hospitals.
From the children to the larger, the rural residents, the farmer women are trying to clean all of them.
Media friends also played a positive role.
I guess we need to move ahead.
Chakti started.
Trying to be finished.
And I believe that we're sure to achieve the purity of ourselves.
If rural India is tested, so far 2 crores 48 lakhs or about two and a half crores of educational institutions have been constructed.
I've planned to build one and a half million toilets in a year.
For health, especially to protect the honor of the citizens - to protect the honor of the mothers and sisters, the urination of urination should be considered in the open places.
For this we started a campaign called Open Defication Free or ODF.
In all the states, in all the districts, a clean competition has been organized in all the villages.
We are becoming successful in the matter of preserving public toilets in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala as soon as possible.
Recently I went to Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi.
The authorities told me when I went recently that Poorbandar turns into a deserted place till October 2nd .
Thanks to those who lost this job.
My salutations to those who're with that direction.
We're all responsible for our mothers, sisters, to convert to a free place of toilet for the health care of small children.
Come on, let's go ahead with all of us complicated for this.
Especially new youths - I'm introducing a pattern for those who fully employ modern, technology.
What is the condition of ' safety machine ' in your swing
Everyone has the right to know about it.
For this, the Indian government has arranged a telephone number.
It's 1969.
It's the thing we all know.
Mahatma Gandhiji was born in 1869.
In 1969 we celebrated the centenary Jayanti festival of Mahatma Gandhi .
In 2019, Mahatma Gandhi's 150th victory was celebrated.
You will be able to call the information about the condition of the school in your village by phoneping for the number 1969.
Besides, you can also take care of the construction of the school.
You must use this facility.
Not that much.
We also started a clean AAP to find out the complaints related to cleanliness.
This app must be used mainly young.
The corporate world is also blessed by the Government of India to come forward for this.
Nine youngsters who want to work for cleanliness can participate in it.
In different districts such youth can be sent to Swachh Bharat activists.
Clear propaganda is not limited to our beliefs, habits.
Cleanliness is that the pill is not complete when our nature has become.
In this age, cleanness, health should be discovered.
Cleanliness must also be added to the substances.
We have to start the West Welth program.
Continues the process of decent vains.
Change them into the bones.
For this, the Central Government has prepared plans.
The red companies have been issued orders to buy the man made of waste.
Provide it to farmers who cultivate central animals.
The Earth was very damaged by chemical reds.
If you want to raise the ground salt, farmers should use central breasts immediately.
So farmers must supply central breasts to companies.
In the announcements related to the use of central ears, the famous actress Shriman Amitab is participating.
I'm inviting people to participate in a group of vandalism.
Recognize new technology to convert waste products into the bones.
It increases the production of rats.
Employment opportunities grow.
That's how the country's economy grows.
It's possible to create wealth from vains.
This year ' Indo-Shan' - India Cleanliness meeting is going on from September 25 to October 2 .
In this, the main missionaries, the missionaries, the Mahanagar fairs, the commissioners are participating throughout the country.
There are discussions about clarity in this meeting.
How should it have technical knowledge
How should the economic requirements be
How to participate in people
How to grow job opportunities.
There are discussions on all these things.
New news about clarity.
Read one day in the paper.
Jagaran Abhiyan ' s famous program has been implemented in connection with the construction of education by going to 107 villages along with the students of Gujarat Technical University .
By doing self-reliance, students have been able to build about 9,000 schools.
You'll have to know about this.
In the leadership of Wing Commander Shri Param Vir Singh, a team completed 2,800 km of swimming from Devprayag in Ganga to Gangasagar.
Through this journey, the purification message was delivered to the people.
The Indian government has created a year old calendar in different branches.
Every branch concentrates on cleanliness with 15 days.
From 1st to 15th of the month of October, good water, purification, panchayatraj, rural development - these three branches are organized by aiming at purification in their work areas.
The last two weeks in the month of October - from 16th to 31st of the year, the Department of Farmers Welfare, Food Transformation, Consumers.
These three departments are conducting publicity programmes in the matter of clarity.
My intention to participate all the citizens in all these departments.
You know that the survey about cleanliness is also happening these days.
What is the situation of cleanliness there by directing the survey of 73 cities .
The frequency was in front of the people.
This time this survey is not happening in 500 cities of the population of Laksh.
There is a self-confidence in every city with these programs.
This time we're behind.
Everyone thinks we're making a big deal of cleanliness in the coming days.
We must provide full support to this cleanliness program.
On the 2nd of October, the Swachh Bharat Mission begins two years after celebrating Mahatma Gandhiji, Lal Bahadur Shastri's victory.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepavali, I want you to buy all the clothes of Goddess.
I'm coming to remind you of buying some dresses in every family.
This time I'm also asking for this.
Due to this the darkness of Deepavali can be rolled in the houses .
Sunday on October 2nd.
Why should not everyone participate in a clean program in a citizen
Two hours, four hours after physical work, you can also participate in yourself.
If you get involved in the purification program, send the photos related to it to the NarendramodiApp.
Send if there are videos.
Through all our efforts across the country, the cleaning program will make a strong effort.
New excitement, inspiration.
Mahatma Gandhiji, reminding Lal Bahadur Shastri Garhs, possibly imagining to do anything good for the whole country.
Lovely my country is a joy to give something in life.
The others don't know if they recognize it.
The joy in giving is marvellous.
I told you to leave the gas subsidi in the past.
The people of the country were slaughtered.
It's a motivated accident in the lives of the people of the country.
On the 8th of October from the 2nd day of October, all the newly elected youths, small organizations, corporate world, schools, clean institutions are celebrated in different cities.
There's no program to provide food items, clothes to a place for the needy people.
When I was in Gujarat, the workers used to roam all the streets, accept old pockets from the people.
The potatoes that have been obtained are provided to the organisations of the towns.
Those pills are so enjoyable for the bad child.
In fact, these programs were determined to be amazing to enjoy the joy.
We have to encourage such programmes of young people.
In such programs, new young people are giving my heart full pleasure.
Lovely my country's Vasulara, on the 25th of September this day.
Pandit Din Dayal's teacher's victory.
From this day, his centenary anniversary begins.
Millions of activists like me are working with the principles he showed.
He directed the Ekatta - Man Darshan is working on the political path of Indian culture and tradition.
The original priest of such a darshala begins from this day on the year of Shat Jayanti , the teacher of Pandit Din Dayal.
"Survival hygiene - survival happiness" is the most important theory.
This is the idea they've provided.
Mahatma Gandhi also said that the development of seventy-five classes is necessary.
What should be done for the benefits of development .
He gave us the country's financial plan in these two centuries.
The teacher of Din Dayal, Shat Jayanti, should be celebrated as 'Garib Kalyan Verses' (Deparation Welfare Year).
Concentrate the attention of society, government, civilians, on the part of how the progressive fruits are available.
That's why we can remove the path from the country.
During the rule of British, the chief minister's residence was known as Race Course Road.
During the centenary victory of the teacher of Pandit Dina Dal it was converted to 'Lock Kalyan Marg '.
Changing like this also points out to celebrate the welfare year.
The great man who took the unique guidance of all of us is greeting the teacher of Din Dayal.
Lovely my country, Vasulara, on the day of the success of the two, I started the program 'Man Ki Bath'.
It's two years for the success of the coming.
It's not a program to admire government activities.
Political church shouldn't be the stage.
'Man Ki Bath' (Speak in Mansu), don't plan to transplant.
I've faced many confrontations during these two days.
I'm involved in many conflicts.
Many times there was no obsessions of a possibilities.
But with all your blessings, you can save 'Man Ki Bath' from such negative powers.
Let's send the message across the common man.
What is the opinion of people
What is the expectations of people
Keeping all of them in mind, 'Man Ki Bath' (Speak in Mansu) organized the program.
Many things tell people through 'Man Ki Bath'.
The power of 125 crores of people in our country came to me by 'Man Ki Bath'.
125 crores of people remembered the ability many times.
I'm inspired by it.
During the completion of the 'Man Ki Bath' program, all of you are so dreadful for the inspiration, blessings.
My appreciations to all of Shrota.
I'm telling you gratefulness to the skywall center too.
Besides spreading my reproach, it covers the grace provided to the people in different languages.
After listening to 'Man Ki Bath' (Man Ki Bath), the people supported by the North, grateful to the civilians who embarrassed the government.
People know what the government's incompletes through the north.
An attempt was made to set up a platform for such problems.
"Man Ki Bath" isn't the only celebration of 15-20 minutes.
An extraordinary program to fully facilitate society.
Such a program is a pleasure to everyone.
I'm thanking everyone who has succeeded this program.
Lovely my country, Vasulara, the next week's Navaratri, Durga Puja, the victory stage festivals are coming.
And Deepawali is also coming.
There is a strange religious atmosphere throughout the country.
It's time to compass power.
The unity of society is the strength of the country.
Navaratri can be or worship Durga.
Eighth festival should be celebrated in the Shakti Upasana Samaj.
Everyone wants to walk on one floor.
How to achieve this .
That's why this hope is celebrating the true victory stage.
Come on.
Get us together to adjust power.
Please read the uninterrupted magic.
Necessary peace to move forward towards the unparalleled Pragati peaks of the country, do not raise the unity, perception.
The Navaratri festival is celebrated with this.
Don't worship Durga.
Let's celebrate the victory of victory.
Thank you so much for everyone.
.
