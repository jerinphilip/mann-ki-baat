25 in the skyworthy.
12.
Mr. Narendra Modi Prasanga, the Chief Minister of the 2016 Navaraya Manki Bath (Speak in Mansu) program, is a namaskara, my country's loving lot.
During Chris-Muss, many purifications to all of you.
Today's day to serve, sacrifice and sacrifice our lives.
"Goods don't have our vengeance to ours." Yes Creator.
Saint Luke confessed in his favourite care not only to serve the poor, but also to enhance the poor.
This is the most authorized.
The story related to it is in great propaganda.
Whatever you say in that story, Jesus is standing near a cave Taluku Koshagar.
Everybody comes and gives a lot of donations.
Then come and give me two coins of two poppies.
There's no big value for two coins seeing a way.
It's natural to have a curiosity among the devotees standing there.
That woman has donated more than all
Because, the rest gave them a lot.
But jesses that she gave all that she had.
Now the victory of Mahamanshi Madan Mohammad Malviya is also on 25th December.
All the visions in the minds of the Indians have made a new way for modern education by Malavia , who has awakened all faith.
My emotional tribute to him on the day of his victory.
Two days ago, I got the chance to pursue a lot of development programs in Banaras, the Tapobhoomi of Malviya.
In Banaras Hindu University of Varanasi , I put a statue to Mahamanshi Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre .
A cancer center is being constructed across that area.
Besides the residents of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, it should be said to the people of Jharkhand, Bihar as well.
It is also the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Waz Pai.
The country doesn't forget the services of Atal.
In their leadership, we've also raised the head of the country in nuclear power.
The party is now, the parlment civilian, the minister, the prime minister, filled up an ideal in every role, Atal.
He greeted them during their birth anniversary, praying to the Lord to give them good health.
I got a job as an attorney.
Many memories are moving in front of the eyes.
Now on the very dawn I've been tweeting, and I also shared an old video.
As a small worker, Atal's lover also found the ability to make rain... see that video.
Now during the Christmas festival, the people of the country will be benefitted by two ways.
If you say a way, two new paths are starting.
The whole country, the villages or the cities, the learners or the illiterates, is it worthless when anyone is naked
How do naked business run
How are the shoppings without money
There's a lot of climate around.
Everyone, learning from each other, learning.
Incentive to this point, the e-payment habits of mobile banking, the Indian government and the small businessmen's cosmos start from the world.
The "Lucky Grahk Passport" and the "Digh Dhan Business Passport" are being promoted to the buyer.
Now on December 25, Chris Muss will receive gifts for fifteen thousand people in drama.
That fifteen thousand people, everybody goes to a thousand rupees prizes in the empty house.
It's only about a hundred days, except for the next day.
Every day 15,000 people get a gift of thousand rupees.
Hundred days, millions of families, millions of rupees are coming.
But, mobile banking, e-bynking, repe card, U.
P.
I, Yu.
S.
S.
Draw is taken on the basis of the use of digital methods like D etc.
And then you'll be deserving this award.
Along with this, a big drag is taken one day a week for such consumers.
Those prizes are also in millions.
Three months later, on the 14th of April, Dr. Baba Saheb will be a bumper dra on the day of Ambedkar's victory.
There are some bullshits in it.
"Digy Dhan business pack" is mainly the businessmen.
Businessmen themselves are part of this group, they can also mix shopkeepers to convert their business into nakedness.
Except traders who do so.
They're also in thousands.
The businessman also runs his own business, so he gets the chance to get the award.
This group has been prepared keeping in mind all sections of society, especially poor and lower middle class classes.
So whoever is Rue.
More than 50--
Those who buy less than 3,000 are only able to get married by this group.
Rue.
Those who buy more than 3,000 don't get this award.
People who don't even believe in you.
S.
S.
You can buy vegetables through a physical phone or a simple phone using DN, sell goods, even cheat money.
Even weekly, this award can be obtained by the Password.
A also in rural areas.
E.
P.
S can buy and sell and they can also win prides.
Many may be surprised, but there are 30 crores of cars on the same day in India, among them 20 crores of poor families, there are these rupees cards for people living in Jan-Dhan Khat.
These 30 crores can soon be part of this prize plan.
I believe the people of the country are interested in this group.
Your young man around will be aware of all these things.
If they ask, they'll tell you all the details.
Even in your families, there will be children studying in the twelveth stages, either they can explain these things to you better.
It's very easy.
So easy, you're easier to send the Wattsup in the mobile phone.
Lovely people of my country, how to use technology in the country, how to e-payment, how to do on-line payments, I'm very happy to see how to grow rapidly.
In the last few days, naked business, non-payment business increased from 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to encourage it.
Businessmen can guess how big this decision can be.
Those traders who celebrate digital lavades, sell on-line payments instead of money in their business, those traders have been allowed to pay taxes.
I appreciate all the states of the country.
I also appreciate the Union Territories.
Everyone carried this effort in front of yourself.
For this reason Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Shri Chandrababu Naidu also became the headquarter of various measures.
But the rest of the governments also started many paths in their own way, I also saw the implementation.
Someone said, the Assam government decides to pay 10 percent of the taxes and trade license fees to the discital.
The branches of rural banks will make at least 2 digital lavades from January 2017 by their 75 percent consumers, from the government.
50,000 prizes.
By March 31, 2017, 100 percent of the digital lavades are under the 'Uttam Panchayat for Digi Transaction' పథకం from the government.
They declared 5 lakh prizes.
Those who use the system of digital illness to buy farmers seeds and buffaloes, in them the first ten farmers are called "Digital Krishik Shiromani".
The Assam government decided to give 5,000 prizes.
All the governments of Assam, I appreciate the rest of the governments that take such a chicken.
Many other organizations have also succeeded in attempts to encourage digital lavadevis with poor farmers in the villages.
Nobody said, "Gujarat Narmada Weli Fertilizer's chief Chemicals Limited (GNFC) company, who sells 1000 p.ms to keep the farmers alive.
Oh.
S.
Keep machines.
Later in a few days 35,000 farmers were given 5 lakh ears of buses by digital disposal.
All this was done in just two weeks.
The funny thing is, compared to the last level, the sale of JNFC rice increased by 27 percent.
My brother-in-law, in our economy, the uncomfortable part of our lifestyle is very big.
We know these girls are given coolie, money, jewelry as naked.
That's why the laboratory of these girls is also going on.
Rue.
Rue to be given 100.
80, Rue.
Rue to be given to 80.
It's 50.
Moreover, in the eyes of healthy areas like beema, they do not have any other facilities available to them.
But now it's going to be ruinless.
The money straightens into the bank.
In this way the uncompromising part is becoming a part of the conflict.
Dopidi's ending.
It's gonna have to give mums anymore.
It's also stopped now.
Now for the girls, the workers, the poor have a way to get all the money.
They also have rights for the rest of the benefits they don't have to play with it.
We're the country that's more than a young percentage.
Technicals are easy for us so our country has to stay so far before all of them.
Our youth has achieved great progress with "Start-up".
This digital pilgrimage is a survival to give all the strength to this region with our younger new ideas, with new technology, with new new techniques.
But we must be all together in this effort to finish the country from black money, to the end of the lunch.
Beloved my countrymen, I'm asking people to give their own advice to the people every month, to say their views.
That's why, MyGov and Norendra Modhi Aap have received 80, 90 per cent of the consultations that have come in thousands of opinions about the fight against black money.
There are also proposals about the swing of the mouth.
When I saw all these things, I divided them into three major departments.
Some people made a lot of description about the problems faced by you, the problem of falling.
The people of the second department, who support this work.
As soon as the work is done, the sacred work is done by the country, people have also proposed to discuss the new uneven paths of any kind of attacks in the country.
The third section of the people who wanted to open their support to whoever happened, that's why they even wanted to go ahead with this fight.
Well, the black money must be completely finished, they're writing so many words that don't move back even more stringent steps for it.
I'm paying for the nation's people who supported me by coming to many norths.
What did Mr. Gurumani Kewl say in MyGov, "This acts taken to seduce money were admirable.
We're all having lots of trouble, but we're all fighting against Alan.
We're happy to cooperate with all of us in this fight.
"We're all working as military troops against black money, sweethearts etc."
The feelings of the words written by Shri Gurumani Kewal are being expressed from all directions of the country.
We're all in the same feeling.
But when it's so hard, it's really a man who is suffering from these problems.
I'm also suffering the same kind of pain that happens to you.
But for an excellent dhythm, the people of the country are dreadful even in these problems, misery and sufferings, when a clean self-sufficient work is being done, to achieve a higher thought.
These guys are the real changes.
Another reason I'm telling people thanks.
They also told some people who tried to get people wrong not only to face many problems but also to face serious problems.
They created many books.
Traditional colours were also attempted to fight on silence and black money.
Somebody had produced spelling on the mouth .
Some more stuff was born that the price of salt increased.
Moreover this rou.
2,000 mouths are also covered, Rue.
500, Rue.
100 rupees of swords were also rebuilt.
But even among such imaginations, rumors, the people of the country couldn't wipe anybody.
Not only that, some wandered, with your intelligence, removing the fists of those who created such sympathy, smelling sympathy.
Nizal also represented.
My favourite greetings to help such people.
I'm feeling every moment that nobody is impossible when 125 crores of people stand with me.
People are God's representations.
Their blessings are the blessings of God.
I'm telling people thanks to the country because people are fully enjoyed in this glory on black money, on silence.
I want to have a wide range of discussions with political classes, political funds, fighting in the parlment against elimination, black money.
It must be a good discussion if the parlment runs in sequence.
In the political circles, some of the creative works are wrong.
The law acts equal to everyone.
Being a man, the organization, the political birds, all of them have to pay tribute to the law.
Anyone who supports all the black money in the outskirts of the government pays attention to the investigation.
Why do the rules change again
This government is for people.
The government has been trying to consistently attract people's opinion.
Where is the problem facing people
What rules do you have trouble
Think how to find their way.
Keeping in mind the happiness of all the people every moment due to being a sensitive government, changes all the rules that people have to change as they can reduce the difficulty.
Another way, I told you the first day, 8th test.
This fight is not normal.
What kind of powers are there in the black business of 70 years of sweetness
How much is their strength
When I decide to fight with such forces, they also constantly seek new measures to defeat the government.
When we choose such new measures, we also have to take appropriate measures to face them.
If he goes deeper, he'll go deeper than ever.
Because we've finished all black money, black traders.
Another piece, everybody's north brought this thing to me.
There are discussions about how the invasions are going on, as they are looking for new joys.
Lovely people of my country are a matter of expression for heart.
You'll be watching the news papers with TV.
New people are getting caught every day.
Get the mouths.
The deal's going on.
Big people are being beaten up.
Is it possible
Don't you tell that secret
The secret is, the details of Naka are coming from the people.
More than how much information is available by the government system, many more information is available from the common people.
And this victory that we've got is possible only because of the common people being incomplete.
Anyone can imagine how courageous the unprecedented citizen of my country is to remove such powers .
That's why there's a lot of success only through the information coming.
The government has made an e-mail address for those who give such information.
You can send the information to him, or send MyGov Ky.
The government is tied to fight all such misery.
It'll be very easy to fight if you have your cooperation.
The third type of Northern writers are in large numbers.
Well, he said, "Don't let Mody go, don't stop.
Any more hard steps have to be put.
Once you choose this path, you have to reach the humiliation.
"I'm saying special thanks for the weekends coming to the other sides.
Because, on one side of their north, there are blessings on the other side.
I'm supposed to believe it's stopping from here.
It's just beginning.
Let's win this fight.
For tiredness, there's no chance to stop.
There are 125 crores of blessings to the people of the country, in that case, the question of stepping.
You know, India has made a law in 1988 on the Benami asset.
But never made the rules of it.
I didn't take it to the people.
That's the same fucking law.
We brought it out, so much sound, "Benami Asti Act".
In the coming days, that law also works on its own.
We'll give it the first priority to what to do for national interest, democracy.
Lovely people of my country, I said in the last word.
In the midst of these hardships, our farmers made a lot of difficulty, got the record by descending below the crop.
Cleanliness in the field of farming.
Being a cousin of this country, this country's raitane, the young man of this country, the heroine of all creations are new.
In the past few days, on the world economic stage, India has made its name so honorable in many parts.
The increase in India's position between the world countries through various references is the success of our country's continuous exercises.
The World Bank's Duing Business Report has increased the country's rounding.
In India, trade practices are trying fast to stand equal to the best practices of the world.
We also have the victory.
According to World Investment Report received by UNCTAD, the country has reached the third place in the 2016-18 list of economically developing countries.
India's position reached 32 ranks in the world's competitive report of the world economic stage.
We reached 16 places in the Global Recommendation Registration 2016.
And we reached 19 places in World Bank's Logistics Performance Index.
And many such reports are also making such suggestions.
India is fast moving forward.
Lovely people of my country, this time the meetings of the parlments have lost the people of the country.
Appearances about the all-round parlment activity have been revealed.
The President, the Deputy President also explained his blessings.
But in such situations some good works are also done .
Then mind feels very happy.
There was an excellent work to see the country in the midst of the disturbances in the parlment.
Brother Soddie Manulara, I'm very enjoying me to open this point, and I'm glory.
The bills related to what our government should be set up for the tourists have passed in a parlment.
On this, I've been meeting the Lok Sabha, all the Rajya Sabha members.
The country's millions of travellers were also driven by them.
Our government is covered for the tourists.
I tried to speed up that effort even personally.
I guess the guys have the right to be honored.
By winning four lines in Paralinpix, all the fellow brothers also gave us the power to our endeavors, to believe.
Besides, they won people with their capability not only to stand the country's honor by their victory.
Everyone of our fellow brother-in-laws also has an unprecedented heritage, power of all the nations.
I'm so enjoyed that this law created for the fair of the survivors grows a lot of opportunities for them.
In government jobs, they have been increased to 4 percent reservation.
With this law special arrangements have also been made for the education of the tourists , facilities and complaints .
In the last couple, the Central Government will tell the 4350 camps run for the passengers to know how much the government is from the clutches of the tourists.
Expending Rs 352 crores, 5,80,000 thousand tourists distributed the necessary equipment for them.
The government brought this law in accordance with the imperialistic feelings.
The first clan was seven types.
But now it has been converted into 21 types of law.
I brought another 14 new classes into it.
By accomplishing it, many new classes of tourists have got justice for the first time.
The classes like Thalassemia, nerve weakness, spinning etc. were also included in this.
My young ladies, I've been listening to the news of increasing our honor in the game for a few weeks.
Indians are really proud.
Indian cricket team defeated England and won the match with 4-0 differences.
In this some young players' talents are shining.
Our young sportsman Karun Nair Trishity, K.
El.
Rahul did 199 runs.
Test captain Virat Kohli showed the symptoms of good leadership with good batting.

Hawky's got a good knife after 15 knees.
I got great grave.
Junior Hockey team pushed the world cap.
After 15, Jewish Hockey team got the chance to knock on the world cup.
A lot of appreciation to all the young players who won this win.
This win is better than the Indian hockey team.
In the last month our female players have also seen miracles.
Indian woman Hockey team won the Asian Champions trophy.
A few days ago in the Under-18 Asia Cup the Indian Women's Hockey Tem Razat Dutt.
Cricket, hockey team players, I'm telling you heartful appreciations.
Dear patriots, 2017 years of new hopes, funny year, Maraloni, we're supposed to convince all your plans, we cross the new peaks of growth.
In 2017, hopefully to get the opportunity of a futile citizen of the country to live peacefully, for the new year 2017, many purifications to all the people of my own country.
Thank you.
