On 15th day, the singing of the Monkey's Bath's program - the voice of the people of the world, my wishes to all of you, this is the 12th event of the hoof of the heart.
This program has been completed for over a decade.
Last year, on the 3rd day of October, the first snake of the heart was found to me.
I don't know what you've got from this, but I can only tell you that it has given me various things.
There is a great significance for people's power in public segment.
There's an idea that's basic in my life, because of this, I'm very confident of the power of these people.
But the voice of the mind has learned many things, which have enjoyed experiences, all of us have contained how much power the people are.
Our fronts, people are expressing the power of the power mechanism.
Keeping me experienced in the hole of the mind, we have great powers in our ancestors, and I can tell you the greatest truth.
Because I feel it myself.
I've received advice from the people for the hoove of the mind.
Every time only 4 or 5 suggestions from them could be shown to me.
But millions of aware citizens brought me advice.
That's one of the biggest powers.
I suggested to the Prime Minister, mygov.
Recorded in the combination, sent letters, but there may have been some of them who never got the chance once, but I didn't believe that.
These lakhs of letters have given me the greatest education.
I've got information about the government's many funny places.
In this matter, I'm demonstrating my appreciation to Al India Radio, they didn't see these suggestions empty papers, looking at them for precautionary precautions.
After that, they made programs.
Different sections of the government have taken part in the programs of radiation.
The department's representatives have predicted privileges.
Trying to solve some things.
The government has also conducted these papers on various departments.
Their principles, however, have been complicated due to the fact that many things started coming before the government were not under the government's attention.
The basic principle is that the guide should be from top to bottom to the bottom of the administration.
Who are you supposed to think that the mind's voice will be invented by the information
But it's just that way.
Like this, the voice of the mind is situated on the outskirts of the hole.
Once I told you I was honestly Selfie with Daughter.
It's the biggest impact of the world's rocks, and millions of people sent smokes with their daughters.
Female kids got the greatest honor.
When they selfie with daughter, smoking with daughter, their daughters' self-confidence increased, they also had a confrontation inside.
Even in the minds of those who watched it, the idea of not enjoying daughters.
A peaceful revolution.
Keeping the Indian tourism department in mind I put forward an element called incredible india.
I'm asking you to send good smokes to me about the places you go.
It's the best way I leave.
But it's got to be the biggest pride for me.
Several lakhs of people have sent photographs taken in the corner of India , and have not been able to imagine the tourism departments of the Indian government and the tourism departments of the states as well .
They all came to a gallery.
They don't have anything to do with the government.
People went ahead of this work.
Before last October, I've already heard about Gandhi Jayanti in the church of my first mind.
.
It was said that on the 2nd day of October we celebrate Gandhiji 's birthday .
Sometimes, there were traitors for the country, but shouldn't it be the traitors for the feature
I've asked people that you buy guys.
Not much, I mean, buy a little.
I've been enjoying that in the last decade, the market sales are only two bullshits.
All this was not done by government advertisements, it didn't cost millions of rupees, which was a change of emotionality, by the outlook of people.
I once appeared in the cheeks of my mind that the shit is burning, the baby cries around, the burning slinder isn't available to my mother.
I've been sending a request to those who are comfortable with this regard.
I'm asking you that the maniac population couldn't be untouched.
Script.
I'm enjoying that 30 lakh families of this country have been snatching jewelry on fire.
There's no such drunken guys.
A relaxed teacher, a woman who lost her husband, I've once seen standing in the television to hang the beast.
It's hard to wipe out the sermons of the community, the middle class people, those who are in the middle floor.
Nevertheless, they're goddamn it.
Isn't it a peaceful revolution
Isn't it the exposition of people's power
Governments also have to learn that the authority of government departments has a greater public power, which is powerful, powerful, determined.
The quantity of governments that join people can be achieved by encouraging social changes.
On whom I was convinced, after the voice program of the mind, they all changed to me.
That's why today I want to demonstrate people's strength by the voice of the mind, once again.
People counted small things I said as a material, made you yourself for folk health, and added you to it.
What else can be pleasant than this
This way I thought I was dealing with a new nucleus in the cheek of the mind.
I've requested the people to record your questions, your suggestions, etc. by contacting you through the phone.
I told you I'd check them in the cheek of the mind.
It's a pleasure to have invited me from more than 55,000 citizens.
All the calls have come from remote areas like Siachen , Garhch , Kamrup , Kashmir , Kanyakumari .
The advice of all parts of India is engraved in the quantity of not coming to calls .
It's a pleasant experience.
All the old people have been advised.
It was comfortable even after listening to some suggestions, and on others my teammen came to pay attention.
You might have spoken for a couple of minutes, but your suggestions and messages are very important to me.
The government will certainly pay full attention to your advice.
Normally it seems that negative ideas are filled with negativeness on the nerves.
But my experience is another kind.
These 55,000 people can be able to express their views without any restriction, whatever they want.
But all of his ideas are made up, like refreshing, refreshing, exposing the cheek of the mind.
It makes me very surprised and enjoyable.
So, how big is our country's prioritization for us, how many people are supposed to make.
There may be a serious offenses in some one-and-a-half percent calls.
But more than 90 percent of the invites were the information of energy and enjoyment.
And specially, the calls from the changing powers, there were more invites from the visually impaired.
They can't see TVs, maybe a major reason for radio careers.
From this I could realize how important the visually impaired is the transmission of those who have vision .
I've got a new ritual.
They're sufficient to act with the government's understanding.
Bhawan Acharya, who has joined the Alwar region of Rajasthan state, has taken a care of me.
I want the people to listen to the advice of Pawan Acharya, to follow it.
My name is Bhavan Acharya, I'm having Alwar area of Rajasthan.
During the Deepavali festival , the Prime Minister Narendra Modi asks the people to use soiled lamps in a large quantity that they should call upon the people of the country in their mind .
And at the same time, the climate is not polluted by the man who uses soil skulls.
I don't believe Pawan's your ideas will go anywhere to the bones of the country.
He's given a very nice idea.
The soil is worthless.
That's why the soiled lights cannot be valued.
There is also a speciality in the environment of tourism.
The lamps are made in the houses of cattle.
The very simple people run their lives by preparing them.
During the events coming here, Pawan Acharya's suggestions would be cursed by the soil lamps, but before the people of the people I'm supposed to sweat in the family of his light harvest.
I've got a chance to spend some time during the Ganesh square, the people of the country.
In a 50-year-old period of war that took place in 1965 with Pakistan, a vision of valor to India Gate in Delhi has been arranged.
I've come to see it very nice.
I've been there for half an hour, but it was two and a half hours when I rolled from there, but I couldn't see it completely.
Isn't there yours
The slaughters were slaughtered alive.
Seeing with art, it was magnificent, even seeing the history, teaching, predicting it in life, it cannot be predicted to serve the motherland.
We're questioning about the greatest emotions of the war, the unbelievable sagas, sacrifices of our soldiers.
There are no smokes, no books attached to that period.
But this museum could have experienced that time.
Haji Peer Poragatum , Asal Uttarpurgarh , Savinderpura , Hajipur Gangetic Views etc . are also present in the form of Mirk Chucherry .
Our Mukhiman's war shame keeps us glorifying.
During that museum, I found the chances of meeting the families of the soldiers who participated in the war and the families of the dwellers.
Some fighters who participated in the war were slaughtered at the evening of their lives, they were also there.
I'm surprised to see their power when I handle them.
It gave me preference.
If you want to preserve history, you must understand the lectures of history.
History connects us with our roots.
This museum of valor has a history of vision, a knowledge of history, a new history and architecture seeds.
If you're close to Delhi, you and your family members, you must go to this miracle that will continue for a while.
Don't get out of there as soon as I do, you must see it completely 3 or 4 hours.
Sure, look.
Look at the power of the public, a boy is commanding the Prime Minister of the country.
But the boy forgets his name.
He couldn't describe it because he didn't have me.
But the matter of that boy tells the Prime Minister is very good to pay attention to himself, not only the people of the country are paying attention to him.
The Prime Minister, they're asking you to finish the campaign of a pure India, it must be arranged everywhere, every street, everywhere.
This boy said it was very right.
The sanitation is that we must be natural, we must make the means of that.
This boy's news is very pleased to me.
On the 2nd day of October, I made pure information.
After independence, for the first time, there are discussions about sanitation of many hours in the court.
Our government's promises are also available.
Moti spoke big words about cleanliness, but what's the favour
Listening to that, there are sorts of things made to me.
I didn't misunderstand it.
I see it very well that the country's administration is also involved in the matters of sanitation.
Look at the other side, what else can be the matter of the country's promising that on one side the court talks about the satisfaction of both the children of the country
As the conceptions run, there is a circumstance against the mosquito, there is a caution on sanitation.
It's definitely working with governments, busy, busy.
Establishments have begun, all the structures to the state and central governments should be managed on this.
We have to move this operation forward.
Even if there are deficiencies, we have to move it forward.
In 2019, when we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Gandhians, we must act as a thrilling dream of Gandhians.
Do you know what the Gandhians said
If once I choose one between him, freedom, satisfaction, I first wanted sanitation, then the country's freedom.
Cleanliness was more important than Gandhiji's freedom.
Come on, we all accept the blackness of Gandhians, act as his wishes are fulfilled.
Kulshan Arota, a resident of Delhi, has booked a report on the mygov contradiction.
The Din Dayal Uyatya wants to know about their centuries.
It's always possible to predict the life of the people of the country, the people of the country.
We don't work to assume that the hypocritical gentlemen are having any principles.
You are the ones who give us preference to all living for the country.
Nowadays many great men can also meet memorials.
On the 25th of September, Din Tyal Upadyaya, on the date of October 2, Gandhiji, Lal Bahadur Sastri, on 11th October, Jayaprakash Narayana, on the date of October 31, the countless names of Sardar Bridge Bottle, in which one of them I describe.
Because this country is a country of great descendants, that is, a country of human beings.
If you take any date, there will be a name of some great priest in history.
We'll fill our minds with the memories about them in the coming days.
We're gonna take home the message they're alive.
We'll try to kill them anymore.
Especially, I'd like to record the date of October 2.
On October 2, the birthday of the deserted Gandhians.
Even last year, there may be many types of fashion dresses, many types of clothes, but I would have to be with me for the traitors.
I'll say once again, for a month's time starting on October 2, it'll be paid in the market sale, use it, together with the traitors, give the same importance to the handicrafts.
How hard our insects work.
The people with 125 crores of people will be able to reach the treasury of five rupees, ten rupees, 50 rupees, even if they buy cashews or slaughterhouses.
That's why on this day of Deepa, we're gonna sure to squeeze me for the traitors, we're gonna have a place for him in our body.
I didn't ask you that you should wear all the trails.
I just want something to put it in place.
Last time you've almost rubbed the sale.
How many dresses have benefited from this
Which work the government cannot spend several crores of rupees, which you can do with the help of small papers.
That's why I'm asking you again for this thing because it's the power of the people.
My mind is enjoyed by the people of the country, even a thing else.
I'd like to share it with you.
I went to Kolkata in the month of May.
Subhash Bose came to meet me his family.
His brother son Chandra Bose arranged for this meeting.
I had the golden chance of spending time with the family of Subhash Bose.
It's the end of the day that the big family of Subhash Baba should come to the Prime Minister's residence.
Chandra Bose and his family are engaged in this work.
It is possible that more than 50 families of Subhash Bose have come to the prime minister last week .
Can you imagine how big it gives me a joy
Everyone of Nataji's family will be able to get the opportunity to visit the Prime Minister for the first time in their lives .
More pleasure than this, the month of October cannot be a big gathering than the prime minister's request.
In the family of Subhash Baba many live in other countries.
I don't know how big auspicious I'm going to get everyone specially for this
I'm waiting with them to welcome them.
Bargavi Kante has conveyed a message to me.
As he says, after listening to his voice, he feels like he's also a head.
Maybe he's supposed to be the head office.
See my name, Connade.
You're gonna be aware of the booking of the Walker for the younger guys.
This will increase the partition of the younger pupil.
I'm asking the Prime Minister to tell you the fact that they're going to be more partial than in the formation of governments in the future.
In the Wagor's list, they've been defined to see the reference and observation of names.
Your table is right.
In public opinion every speaker plays an important role in deciding the law of the country.
This awareness grows gradually.
The surveillance percentage is also increasing.
For this, I'm supposed to demonstrate my lives to the country's legislature.
A few years ago, our Secretary-General Regulator was busy working.
But for the past few years, there has been a major change in its operation.
Today, our legislative committee didn't do the job to distinguish, it has been activated in a way as a Facilitator, easier and subordinate.
It's helping the vocalists.
Walkers are the center of all their activities and ideas.
It's a very familiar change.
But it's gonna be just a legislative executive.
We should also work in schools, colleges, and work to make these awareness in the residential areas.
Walker's list must be renewed and we should also look into the valuable rights we have received, and see if I'm not using my authority.
We have to take it as an illusion.
I want the young people of the country to try to join you in the Walker list, to participate in the watch.
I'm sure I'm coming to tell you something during the dynasty.
First sworn, then everything else.
Everyone has to do this sacred work.
I went to Varanasi some days ago, where I could meet the guy, participated in many events.
Even if I met Father, I'd like to talk to you about two boys among them.
They met a young man studying the eighth grade of Kshitiz Bande.
In the Cantonment Village of Banaras Hindu University seventh grade is taught.
This young man's self-confidence is very wise.
But even at this young age, I could see his country in the field.
He reads a lot, may be learning a lot in synthesis, see new tests, train accidents can be prevented by any technique, how to drive less, in Robo how human feelings can be finished.
Very strange boy.
I can't see what he said, but when he sees his self-confidence and dancing, our country's boys need to grow a dance on science.
The questions in the minds of the boys should come up constantly - why, how, when, they must be in their minds.
Like this, there was a chance to meet a boy named Sonam Betel.
The 9th year old in Sundarpur of Varanasi is the daughter of this young Satavruj boat .
This woman with a very deep family.
Speak the whole cheek with this kid
But the biggest thing is that, as soon as she asked about something of the priest, she gave her English description and Hindi language.
When I asked her to meet her, she told her that she had been telling it to her 5th year.
He asked me where he learned it, we didn't know it.
When I ask her what she reads, she's reading her legend in the morning, she'll make her understand everything in the evening, take the history, she'll be supposed to be confessed within hours.
And he's surprised us all in the family.
It made me a big impact on yourself.
Some kids have an interest in gains, but the child doesn't have any interest in Sonmuko.
I just felt that God has given him some special power.
I've met these two kids a special thing during this Kashi tour.
I'd like to share it with you.
Some people bring me a lot of work in the cheeks of the mind.
Listen to the doubts of Haryana.
A month you're gonna make the hole of your mind once a week.
Because, we get more pregnancy from this.
Sandeep, you know what you want to buy from me, don't you
I have to try to do this once a month, to expel the time.
In some cases, our friends with Al India Radio have to wait 30 minutes, 45 minutes, but I'm ignoring your feelings, I'm supposed to thank you for your advice.
It's okay now every month.
It's been over a year since the hole of the mind.
Do you know what sort of Subhash Bob used the window
In Germany, he started drifting.
For the people living in India, they have been spreading their thoughts through the radiation regarding freedom fighters.
The beginning of Asad Hindu Radio was done by a warrant report.
In many languages he used to drive in English, Hindi, Bengali, Maratha, Punjab, Urdu, Pashtu.
My radio has already been completed for a decade by the voice program of the mind.
My voice of the mind, the reason for you to turn your hole.
I'm listening to your voices, thinking about it, looking at your suggestions.
That's what my ideas start to shrink.
They're coming to you through Al-India radio.
It's your opinion, even if it's what we say.
That's my pleasure.
Next month, we're meeting again in the voice program.
Your advice and obtaining, the government benefits from your advice, it's complicated.
One of your participants is impossible for me.
I'm sorry to all of you again.
Thank you.
.
