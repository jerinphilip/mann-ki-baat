On 15th day, you're enjoying the fury of the Monkey Bath's program, the voice of the mind, the people of the country, the sadness of Dipavalith.
There's a chance to go to some place, you're starting to do business with a new excitement.
On the other hand, the beginning of the Christomas is going on.
I have a different opinion in social life.
Sometimes the pavilions are also beneficial to cover the wounds.
Sometimes they give new injections.
But sometimes when the confluences come in the wedding days, they are very grievous.
In the world, there are continuous colors of information about natural locations.
Until now, there are reports of personal possibilities in question as well.
We're coming to experience now how fast the impact of changes in the air.
In our country itself , the weather remains very rainy in the past , especially in Tamil Nadu and other places it has been destroyed .
Many are alive.
I'm supposed to demonstrate my deep diamond to all the families suffering from this confluence.
State governments are engaged in mercury and space rehabilitation activities in the entire sweep.
The Central Government has always been mixing the shoulders with the shoulders.
Now a team of Central Government has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I believe in the power of Tamilnadu.
I'm convinced that Tamil Nadu will gain its share in the progress of the country, even though it's all the confluences.
But there's a feeling of such a confused environment on the surroundings that we have to make a change in our coming.
Until just 15 years ago, Nature has been associated with the farming sector.
Because it was only with the dry, cotton, if the natural neighbors all the time.
But now it's changed.
We need to enhance our capacity to face the neighbor at all levels.
Governments, public society, citizens, small and big structures have to be implemented in the field of science-purpose.
After the landscape in Nepal, I had to talk to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawas Sharif.
I suggested that we should conduct a comprehensive operation in the preference to meet the neighborhood connected with the Technical Countries.
One of the best ways to compete with this related observation are also enjoying me to walk in New Delhi .
It's a good start.
Luckwinder Singh, a resident of Punjab, is in touch with the phone...
.
I'm talking to Lakwinder Singh, affiliated to the Punjab State Waterfall.
We're coming here with the help of natural trading, and many people are guided to agriculture.
After the slaughter, people are burnt to the slaughter, by which the microbes on the lap of the earth are affected, and they want to know how to stop it, and how to control the environmental modes of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab.
Lakwinder Singh, your opinion gives me the least joy.
This is one of the reasons why you're making the natural way of farming.
It gives you more joy that you understand the problems of farmers, not just doing this.
It's your concern.
But this is not going to happen in any Punjab, Haryana.
The whole of India is our own obligation, traditionally we are burning the farming habits that follow the consequences.
We didn't know about the damage caused by burning like this before, so everyone did, so I was saying I'm doing it.
Secondly, there was such an unexpected practice about what was the other way.
Because of this, it's been continuously, growing up.
Now it's connected to the weather change.
After the impact of this confluence began to shout the immune voices of the people.
That's the real concern you're showing up.
First of all, our farmer friends should be trained, explain the truth to them.
In such a way, by burning the adventurous seizures, time can be mixed, reducing the consequences, to reach the next stage.
But it's not the right procedure.
The precious valuables for the hijacking are also very expensive.
They're natural paths.
We're wearing them.
Not only this, if we make them a small piece of pieces, they can stay in the legs.
Secondly, if we burn them, we'll rotate the floor on the ground.
Look at my farmer brothers, a husband, our bones are sure, our heart works well, our kidneys work, all right, but if the skin on the body burns, can we survive, say
If our body's skin is burnt, we can't live, even if we burn the consequences of the consequences, the fertilizers of the Earth, the skin of the mother is burnt, our land burns on the ground.
It drives our crops to obstacles.
That's why we're gonna have to take action in this direction.
Even if we're buried in the ground again, we'll turn it into hell.
Or collecting them all, filling them in a dog, mixing water with soil, it turns into a very important fault.
With this, our land will be protected, when it is planted in that catastrophe, it will benefit from the railroad.
I've got a chance to talk to the farmers who were busy with the bullshit.
They shared your experiences with me.
They had to spend 5,000,000, 10,000, 15,000 rupees for the hectare, after they had slaughtered their lives before.
They had no work till they came to the tractors.
But some agricultural brothers cut it up to 6 to 8 inches, put them in the ground.
It has been experienced that due to this life being adorable water , it has not been necessary to mix water for only 3 months in those places by placing it on trees or plants and pyros .
The water in the mud was enough for the crops.
Today those pulses have also become very expensive by which they get revenue.
Any pieces that had to be extracted before, now, that piece of piece has become a condition of burying them.
Look at the slightest test that's best.
Our agricultural brothers aren't the scientists of any kind.
I'm the people of the country
On the 3rd December to come, it is held every day for the change of powerful people.
Last time, in the cheek of the mind, I've spoken about body parts.
It's about NOTO free phone numbers.
I've been told that the phone calls have increased by 7 times after the cheeks of the mind, the mortgage has increased by 21 times.
On the 27th day of November the Indian body part was spent on daily basis .
In this, many leaders of the community participated.
Filmmaker Ravina Dondon has joined you in many privileges.
Organ donation can protect many lives.
What else can be bigger than this
Recording center for national level body part changes related matters related to patients , organ donations , etc. were started on 27th November.
MyGov to a national match for the NOTO, the marking of the donor and the knee shape.
I was arranged in the combination.
It was a great surprise to me that many people participated, presented themselves in new ways, expressed their views in a very emotional way.
I believe that awareness is spreading in this area, and I believe those who need definitely get help at your time.
Because, until someone doesn't have to donate, this help can't be found in any way.
I've already said that on the 3rd day of December, we're supposed to be changing powerful every day.
Organic, physically transformed, unimportant, unparalleled, unparalleled.
Sometimes when they're familiar with the papers, the mind gets distressed.
Sometimes they express their blackness and yourself.
But if we change our glimpse, they'll fix the vision we see, they'll describe as a prediction to us, the achievements will make us a liberal power.
If we come to a small place, we start tears, I think it's a very small scale of confluence, but they're in such a situation.
That's why I think they're all inventions of pregnancy.
The ability, thirst, a great appreciation of their minds, the survival of life, the survival of the confluence, and the confluence.
I'd like to talk about Javet Ahmed, 40-42 years old.
In 1996, in Kachmeer, the artisans on Javad Ahmed.
But even if he was alive, the artificiaries sucked his urinary bladder, a part of the urinary bladder was damaged, there was an acute necklace in the spinal cord, and there was an acute effect of unable to stand up.
But Javed did not accept the defeat of Ahmed.
The violent wounds didn't disturb him.
He didn't have any part of his nuisance.
A man who didn't commit any crime had received such a sentence, his young man was gone to Venakip, but he didn't have any anger, anger in his mind.
This confluence has also changed Havet Ahmed as an achievement.
He dedicated his entire life to social service.
Even though the body did not work, he had dedicated himself to education for the last 20 years.
He comes under the leadership of how to improve the necessary responsibilities for the physical alteration capabilities, how to facilitate the facilities of government offices, change capabilities etc.
In the social work, the hips are finished.
As a social servant, as a curiosity dweller, he's being a pawn of reversal powers, today he's making a peaceful revolution.
Javed's life is sufficient for the Indians.
I'd like Javet's life, his skull, his dedication emotion, a special reminder on the 3rd of December.
I can only talk about Javedas because of the time being, even though India's nostrils are dripping up such pregnancy, giving numbness to life, the paths are coming out.
Thus, on the 3rd day of December, we're the day to get impatient from them.
In many things, we need to run on government.
They are all constantly related to government and government related structures, such as middle class people, underground people, poor people, sufferers, hungry people, abandoned.
Like a simple dweller, there is a possibility of getting a serious experience with government servants in some way.
This one-and-a-half terrible experience affects the state practice of their entire life.
It's really impaired.
But in some cases, millions of people living in these government departments do very important works with the feelings of service, with dedication, which are not always in our eyes.
It's also a government machine, which has been done by a government servant, that we have an unidentified activity.
Our country is full of Asha Sevakis, that is, the rural health is working on their own.
Many of us in the country may be questioned about the work of these ashes.
But the world famous family of Bill Gates, Bill Gates and Milinda Gates, have been honored with the award of Padma Bhushan last time.
These couples spend their wealth in their comfortable life in Membat .
They're very praiseworthy about the Asha Sevaks who join me all the time they meet me, that those servants' serving feelings are very fond of, specially worked, are more interested in learning new things.
On the contemporary occasion Orissa state government gave a special pride to Asha Sevagi for independence .
The nearest village of Balasore district of Orissa state , the total population of Tendga is also tribal .
The village in the depth of the village is the condition of malaria.
Jamuna Mani Singh, a resident of this village, decided that anyone affiliated with this tantaka would not die of malaria.
If he goes home, finds the information that someone has suffered from fever, he will immediately take the medical help of his own training, in every house he uses mosquitoes, as a person pays attention to the maintenance of his own child, the same way Asha Sewaki will be brought to the entire village of Jumuna Mani Singh.
He foiled the struggle against Malaria and preferred the entire village to face it.
Something like this may be in Jamuna country.
We can guess their work
Such people live in the largest numbers of our country.
Participates in the glad temperaments of Samudya.
I'm supposed to all the Asha Sevas, Jamuna Mani, smell my admirations by them.
MyGov for my young friends, my young friends, who are busy working in social magics, combination gallery.
I'm sending three fuel books, that means we books.
One, about the possibilities of a pure India-related pregnancy, the next, the project of a village program like an executive member, the other is related to the health sector.
I'm asking you that you must look at it.
Recommend not only you study but also others.
Maybe you can also add your ideas to it.
Even if some things don't go to our blackness immediately, it's yours to enjoy the thrilling power of society.
The power of architecture is the biggest slope.
You're also concerned about the good complications related to this, share these e-books, make complications about it.
An interesting young man will be able to find these e-books together with students studying 8,9,10 square studies in his home school composition, and you will also be a social guide.
In this matter I'll invite you, come, join you to make a meeting.
I'm deeply worried about the weather change all over the world, people of the country.
Climate change, world warmth, is communicating in all the places.
It has been accepted as an original saying that even before doing any action it is concerned about the impact of the environment .
It is not only the responsibility of everyone that the temperature of the world should not be increased, but the concern of everyone is also changed.
One of the primary methods to avoid temperature rise, the energy conservation, that means.
On the 14th of December, the national burning day.
Several schemes are being implemented in the state level.
The LED pulp drives into progress.
On the night of Purnami, I told you once that the street lamps should be damned, one hour full moonlight.
The friend sent a joint to my vision, and found me a chance to see it.
I found it to be part of you.
If you see, it'll be appreciated by ze news.
In Kanpur, a woman named Noorjahan is doing unbelievable work.
He's been busy trying to excite the evils using the sun power, fighting with skin, working according to his name.
He's made a team of women.
The lightning of the light of the lantern running with the sun power has begun .
In the month of one hundred rupees, he comes with this lantern lamp.
People go by buying these lights in the evening, giving them a glimpse of it in the morning.
I know that only 500 households are giving such glimpses to Landers.
The daily routine gets the light of the house at the cost of 3 or 4 rupees.
Throughout the day, this Nurjahan work is going on in the work of lighting these laundars.
If a large number of people are working against the weather changes, like Noorjahan, they are acting as predictions to others.
Even with the name of Noorjahan, doesn't it mean to light the world
Through this work, he describes in other people, praises him for me.
I'm supposed to appreciate my mental appreciation to the television agency that took the world to this simultaneous presentation of one of the corners of Kanpur.
Abhishek Kumar Bande of Uttra Pradesh has conveyed his views through my phone...
..
..
..
Well, from Gorakpur I'm talking to Abishek Kumar Bande.
I'm looking at a businessman here.
In order to initiate the Mutra Bank's plan, I'm telling the Prime Minister my gratitude to him.
I want to know from the Prime Minister how Mutra Bank helps the business end.
They're the apphek of Coracpore, thanks for you.
The Fund Unfunded, whoever doesn't have the money, is the purpose of the Mutra Bank to make them financial.
If I describe it in a simple way, it contains three stories like Enterprise, that's the end, Earning, that's the fifth, Empowerment, that's the transfer of power.
The Mudra Yojana enjoys the opportunity of communicating the industrial sector and enjoys the actual authority.
This Mutra program is being implemented to help small business partners.
I'm expecting it's working at the fastest time I want.
But there's a good start.
In very less time 66 lakh people got Rs 42,000 crore through the Prime Minister Mutra Yojana .
They're no one else...
.
Small businessmen who sell news, sell milk sellers.
In these 66 lakh tourists 24 lakh women are enjoying me .
Most of the people who use this scheme in large quantities are deserted , reproduced communities and tribes who want to run their families with pride in their work .
Abhishek showed his excitement, but there are colors that have come in many information about it.
I have received a report that a person named Cylesh Bhosle of Mumbai has got a loan of 82 lakh rupees through Mutra program .
He's initiated the business of extracting water.
I've already told you that clean India will create such industrialists.
They're thrilling it in Sylesh Phones.
I know he's buying the tanker, and he's paying back 2 lakh rupees to the bank shortly.
This is our only regulation regarding the Mutra plan.
Mother Sharma associated with Bhopal city was also mentioned in this regard .
He also got Rs 40,000 from the bank according to the Prime Minister Mutra project.
He's busy working to make a handkerchief.
All the time before, he had earned a lot of money, and had to pay the loan very sick.
But now the native population gets the same treasure, he's starting to do his job specially.
Because of not paying too much brickets every month only 1000 rupees are minimised.
His family also has a good business.
But I'd like to expand this plan further privilege.
All our banks have to negotiate it with a lot of intelligence, help the small businessmen in large quantities.
In fact, they are acting as economic engineers of the country.
They are the economic powers of the country.
They're the only ones we want to impatient.
Good thing happened, but it's too much, more important to walk.
On the 31st of October, on the birthday of Sardar Brahb Bai Bote, I spoke about the same India-majestic India.
Such things must be ourselves in the enforcement of the community.
Rashtrayam Jakrayam Way, Eternal Vigilance is the liberty of the price, that the price we pay for freedom is to be constantly awake.
There must be continuous songs of the country's supremacy.
I think it's a plan to be the same India, special India.
Mygov.
I'm gonna get the advice in.
I've been asking all the plans to be efficient, how mudra should be, how people should make participants, what shapes should be.
I'm telling you that there are colors available in the quantity of suggestions.
But I'm expecting more suggestions.
I'm predicting the plan.
I've been told that there are proofs for the participants and large-scale gifts.
You'll also finish your creative skills.
I'm supposed to tell you how the plan can be formulated in a way to connect every Indian with the mantra of unity, unity, single India, special India.
It must be alive, survivors, must be punched, and in the same way it must be a hole connecting to everyone.
Tell me what should be the partition of everybody in the government, public, community.
I believe your best suggestions will certainly be in the farm.
My brothers and sisters, the winter begins.
But in winters food is very simple even if there are clothes in your food .
But I'd like to take physical exercises together.
To keep body healthy use this good weather condition properly .
Do exercise , yoga practice etc .
Make a circumstance for it even in the family.
An hour and the whole family will be involved in it.
You will feel how your body cooperates with your activities throughout the day.
Good weather, you can handle good habits.
My lives are once again the people of the country, Jai Hind
.
