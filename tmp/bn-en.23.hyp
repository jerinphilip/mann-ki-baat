My favourite patriots on March 2017, greeting all of you
Most families in every corner of the country are busy examining their children.
Those who have finished their tests have some restless environment and where the test is going on, the families are still under some pressure.
But at one time I'll tell you that last time I heard the words I told the students about what the mind was.
You're sure they're gonna be working at the time of the test.
It's March 26.
Freedom Day on 26th March.
Historical battle against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh led by Bangabandhu.
Today, on this great day, I am very happy with the independence of the civilian brothers and sisters of Bangladesh.
And I wish that the advancement of Bangladesh, the development of Bangladesh and the residents of Bangladesh will also give me the assurance that India is a strong partner, a good friend and we will contribute to peace and security and development in this entire region.
We're all proud of this that the Rangavant Tagore, his memory, the heritage of our two countries.
Bangla national music is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
It is a very interesting fact about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore that in 1913, he was not only the first Asian person honored by the Nobel Prize, but also gave him the Nighthood title.
And in 1919 when the British run the genius in Jalianwala Bagh, then the princes of the Rabindranath Tagore were obsessed with the promise of all the great men and at that time when a child of twelve years had a deep impact on this incident.
In the fields : The brutal murder of Jalian Walabagh brought a new face in the life of the boy who was ridiculed in the field.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old boy God is our favourite, our inspiration - martyred God singh.
Three days before today , on 23 March , Bhagat Singh and his colleagues - Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged and we all knew that incident of 23 March - Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , on the face of Rajguru , there was no death - sufficient hunger to serve the mother of India .
They gave all the dreams of life to freedom of Mother India.
And the three heroes are our inspirations.
We cannot describe the words of Lord Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
The entire British administration was afraid of these three young men.
They were locked in jail, they were fine on the day of the trap, but what could be done with them was upset by the British.
And so on March 24, where the funny was hanging on the 23th floor.
It's hiding that can't be seen normally.
And after that, the British quietly buried their dead bodies in today's Punjab.
Several years ago, when I got the first chance to go there, I felt the vibration of that land.
And I must tell the young people of the country , whenever you get the opportunity to go to Punjab, you must go to the tomb of Lord Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , Bhagatt Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt.
At this time, there was no freedom, its rapidity, its craving.
On one hand, the heroes like Lord Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru gave inspiration to armed revolutions.
On the other hand, just 100 years before today, on April 10, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi embraced Champaran.
This year, hundreds of years of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the freedom struggle of India, the emergence of Gandhi Bhadhara and Gandhi style was seen in Champaran for the first time.
In the whole movement of freedom, it was a pattern change, especially from the rituals of the combination.
This festival , the Satyagraha of Champaran , the Kheda Satyagraha , the Hartal of the workers of the factory in Ahmadabad - and in all this the deep impact of the style of Mahatma Gandhi's ideas and work was visible.
In 1915, Gandhiji came back from abroad and in 1917, he went to a small village in Bihar and gave new inspiration to the country.
We cannot valuate Champaran Satyagraha on the picture of Mahatma Gandhi in our mind today.
Imagine a man who came back to Hindustan in 1915, worked only two years.
I don't know the country, it didn't have any effect, it was just the beginning.
We could guess how hard he had to suffer, how hard he had to work.
And the Champaran Satyagraha was such that the organizational trick of Mahatma Gandhi , the power to know the narratives of Mahatma Gandhi ' s Indian society , the rivalry against the British administration through his own behavior , making the unconscious person unconscious , inspiring , bringing in the field of fight - one wonderful power was exhibited .
So we can feel the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think of Gandhi hundred years ago, that Champaran is Gandhi's satyagraha, then it is a deep study of Champaran realization for a person to enter the organ of life.
We can learn from him how to work and how to work and how Gandhi did it.
And that was the time when Tabad Tabad leaders, whom we heard, were Rajendrababu, Acharya Kripalani Hon - Gandhi sent everyone to the village.
Together with the humans, the man who worked, had taught him the methods of dragging into the color of freedom.
And the British didn't understand what the rituals of Gandhi's work were.
The fight is going on, the creation goes on and the two run together.
Gandhi made two backs of a ninth paisa : a fight on the back is born in another back.
On one hand, filling the jail, putting yourself on the other hand.
A wonderful balance was in Gandhi's working style.
What can be the meaning of Satyagraha , what can be unbearable , what can be the meaning of unbearableness in front of such a large empire - not only by words , but by successful representation Gandhi presented a complete new guide .
Today when the whole country is fulfiling hundreds of years of Champaran Satyagraha , how immense is the strength of the common man of new India , this infinite power like freedom struggle , in the journey of Suraj from Swaraj , the imagination strength of one hundred and fifty crore Indians , labor .
Beautiful in all the heats : The unbroken effort of showing this mantra to the country, for the society, will fulfill the dreams of all the great men who gave life to the country's freedom.
And in this twentieth century there are such Indians who do not want change, who do not want to be participant in the progress of the country.
A new India - New I wish for the progress of hundred and fifty million Indians .
The seeds of the ndia will split.
New I
India, that is, New India is not a government program, not a political group, or a project.
This is one hundred and fifty million countrymen.
The whole of India wants to create an atomic, integral country.
This is a hope of their mind, a vision, an aspiration.
My favorite patriots , if we keep our personal life together in a sensitive vision and try to understand and understand the activities of society , then we will be surprised to see lakhs of people who are selflessly absorbed , deserved , poor and terrible people do nothing for the society and are walking like silent hypocrisy .
There are so many people who go regularly to the hospital to serve the people.
There are many who come forward automatically to donate blood when they hear the need for blood donation.
There's a lot of people who arrange hungry food.
The service of the Lord of our country Ratan Garva and Johnsevai - This idea is our birth.
If we look at this thought together, it will be understood how big it is.
New I
In the context of the ndia , the vision that comes up is very normal and inevitable.
But it is also true that if the entire nation visualizes and takes a definite step in realizing it, then the dreams of a new India can be successful.
It's not necessary that Esmast work is to be done in budget or government expenditure.
If every citizen imagines that he follows the traffic rules , follows his own duty , stop using petrol - diesel at least one day in a week , then through these small steps we will take new I .
I'll see the dream of Nedia.
I'm gonna say that everybody should follow their own citizens, follow the duty.
This can be the information of the formation of 'New India'.
Next 2022 - It's been about 50 years of India's independence.
Come, we remember Lord Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev on this occasion, remember Champaran Satyagraha.
I'm calling you , come , enjoy your life and enjoy yourselves and participate in this journey from Swaraj .
My dear countrymen, today I wanna express my gratitude to you.
For the past few months, we have signed a large number of people in the Digital Pement that means "Digithan" movement.
Man's generosity towards cashless lendeen has increased, poor people are also trying to teach and gradually hung everybody down the cashless lende.
I saw the encouraging of various methods of digital penetration and its use after immunization .
The ' Bhim' app started two-and-a-half months ago, but almost one and a half people already downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, the fight against black money and evils must be carried forward.
Is it possible for a hundred and fifty million countrymen to imagine a digital loan of two and a half thousand crore rupees in a year
If you want to wait for a year.
It's possible for six months.
We mentioned this in the budget.
How can this two-and-a-half million digital lendeen be possible
When we pay school fees, we'll pay the digital without using cash.
I'll pay the digital at the time of the train or the air travel.
We'll use digital medium during the time of buying medicines or in the shop.
We can take such a step in a lifetime.
You can't even imagine, so you can be a big partner of the country.
A brave soldier can defend himself against black money and evil.
A few days ago, the 'Digithan Mela' was organized for public education and awareness.
A hundred programs are decided all over the country, in which 80-85 have already been completed.
The prize was arranged in this.
About thirty and a half lakh people got fixed prizes for the consumers and got fixed awards for seventy thousand people traders .
Everyone present has imagined to take this effort further.
14th April, Dr. Babasaheb's birth anniversary.
According to the pre-determined plan 14th April this DG fair will be concluded.
A big event will be organized after the end of a hundred days, where a big drag will be arranged.
I think the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambeddakara is still there in which there is a grand publicity of Bhima App .
Let's join this effort to reduce cash lendeen and notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that whenever you want your advice for ' mind orat ' , there is a lot of opinion.
But I'm sure there's no interest in cleanliness.
From Dehradun, a daughter named Gayatri - who sent a message to the phone of Ekash's class.
Chief Teacher, Chief Minister, I'm sorry to tell you.
First of all, I congratulate you that you have won a lot of votes in this election.
I want to tell you my mind.
I guess how much cleanliness is necessary to explain to the common man.
I pass through a river every day, where people throw a lot of garbage and destroy the river.
This river flows through Rispana bridge and flows through our homes .
To keep this river clean, I went to the basket and spoke to the people, but I didn't get any special benefit.
I'll request you to send a team here or publish this matter through newspapers.
Thank you
Brothers, you see how much trouble a girl in Ekadash.
How crazy he saw the dirt dust in the river
I think it's a good signal.
I only want 125 million people to be angry with the immersion.
Once there is anger, if there is discomfort, we can do something in the drive against the rubbish.
It's a good thing that Gayatri himself expressed anger, advised me and told me that he tried a lot, but failed.
Since the movement of cleanliness has started, awareness has increased.
Everyone's connected to it in a positive way.
It took the form of a movement.
The hatred of the waste is slowly growing.
Be aware, actively take part, organisation. It has its own importance.
But the matter of hygiene is more related to practice than movement .
That's why the movement of the movement change, the movement to create the habit of cleanliness.
This movement is possible in public.
It's hard, but we have to do it.
I believe the consciousness among the new ones of the country, among the boys, among the boys, among the young people, is indicating a good description.
Today, my mind is vaat . I'm going to listen to Gayatri, I'm going to tell all the patriots that the Gayatri speaks of all of us.
My dear patriots, since I am performing a "What vaat" program, there is a lot of suggestions from the beginning, many people who have expressed their concerns are all about nutritional food, we all know that in the house or in any community food, we take the extra hallucination.
I can't eat all that I see in front of my eyes, and I can't eat at last.
As much as you stop, you can't get half in the stomach, and leave it alone.
Sometimes you thought how much we'd humiliate with the incorrect food we'd drop.
Have you ever thought that if you don't humiliate, how poor this food can fill the stomach.
There's nothing different about this.
Normally when the mother finishes the small children in our house, she says, take as much as she can eat.
There must be some effort in this mortality, but in spite of this, desperate social disorder.
It's unfair to the poor.
Secondly, if you're comfortable, the family will also have financial benefits.
It is good for society , but this thing is such that the family will also be successful in it .
I don't want to say anything about this but I want to increase awareness.
I know some young men, who are involved in this kind of movement.
They made mobile apps and if there were such inventions somewhere, then people gathered to describe it.
Our country's newborns do this kind of work.
This kind of person will be found somewhere in every state of the country.
They're gonna get our inspiration so that we don't ruin the food.
We'll take as much as we eat.
That's the way to change.
And those who are healthy , they always say - keep the plate a little empty , keep your stomach empty .
When you come to health then say , ' World Health Day ' April 7 .
Universal Health Coverage (Universal Health Coverage) by 2030 means "Health for everyone".
Now the nation has given special attention to depreciation on 7th April World Health Day.
Them depression of this time.
We know the depreciation word, but if we mean a letter, then some people call it a depression.
According to a hessev, more than thirty-five million people in the world are victims of mental depression.
The problem is most of us are victims of this disease, but we don't understand it.
And maybe I'm sorry to talk to my mind.
The one who feels depressed himself doesn't even say anything.
Because, he feels sorry to talk about it.
I want to tell my countrymen, depreciation is not that he can't be freed.
When a psychological process is created, he begins to get rid of it.
The first thing is depreciation-- don't suppress him and express him.
With your friends , with your brothers and sisters , open your mind to the teacher - what is happening inside you .
In the hostel, there's a lot of time loneliness.
Fortunately, we grew up in the community.
It's a very big community family.
Depreciation is finished when everyone is together.
Even then, I'll tell my parents, take care, if the family members were mixed together before they wanted to keep themselves separated by eating.
I don't like that member of the family. I don't want to go.
Have you ever thought why that man is doing this
You're sure, these are the first symptoms of depression.
If you want to keep yourself away from the middle of everyone, keep in mind that you don't let him be alone.
Let's stay with those whom he likes to stay with.
Hillood's funny talk to him openly.
He's hiding his worries deep in his mind, find out.
That's the best way.
Remember, the body starts getting worse from depression.
In diseases like diabetes people become physically weak , depression reduces the conception of human beings , cuts courage , reduces the strength of fighting in lifetime .
It destroys all our lifestyle.
All your friends - friends , relatives - families - all keep you away from depreciation and also get rid of depreciation .
If you can't express yourself among many, I'll tell you another way.
Go to him if you're a social worker in your area.
People's sorrows for serving, sorrows and problems of their life will start to share the depreciation of the mind.
If you begin to solve the problem of others with the minds of service, your confidence will come back.
If you can mix yourself with others, you can serve and if you can do it freely, see if your mind becomes light.
Yoga habits but a favorite way of keeping the mind health beautiful.
Yoga is an extremely effective way to get rid of the mentality, freedom from the state of compassion and happy mindset.
Every year 21 June International Yoga Day is celebrated.
This is going to be the third year.
You're starting to be ready.
Everyone will have to celebrate this festival in the Mahasamroh.
If you have to give some advice on the International Yoga Day , send me all the ideas through my mobile app , show the way .
Stay writing so many poems, songs, so that there can be a gesture among the common people.
Now I'll tell the mother and sisters something.
There's a lot of talk about health care.
A few days ago, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
The working women in our country, the women involved in various operations, have increased their numbers.
It's a very good thing to increase the rate of women's participation.
But there's another important responsibility for women.
They're dealing with the world, dealing with the economic aspects of the world and injustice to the newborn.
That's why the Indian government has taken a very important decision.
Working women during pregnancy , pregnancy and delivery - The maternal grandmother was given at the time of reproduction , 12 weeks earlier .
Now the maternity holiday has been increased from 12 weeks to 26 weeks.
There are only two or three countries in the world ahead of us.
It's a great effort to make the holidays for Haboo Maiden.
They'll get a full mom's attention from pregnancy to the right circumstance of a newborn baby, and they're our next day's citizen.
When these kids grow up, they'll be the wealth of the country.
Mother's health will also be good in this important decision.
In the organized sector, this rule of about 18 lakh mothers will be very useful.
My dear countrymen, Ramnavmi celebrations will be celebrated on April 5.
Mahavir Jayanti on 9th April, then on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Amedkar.
The life of these great men inspire us and New I
India enhances the strength of the structure.
Two days later, Chaitra sucklet security, on the first day of the year.
New Year will come, you're very happy for that
It's time to harvest crops after spring, it's time to harvest the farming brothers.
The new year celebrations run differently in different parts of our country.
In Maharashtra ' jaggery ' , in Andhra - Karnataka runs in the new year ' Ugadi ' , Sindhi ' Cheti Chand ' , Kashmiri ' Navreh ' , Ayodh - A ' Sanvaskar Puja ' , ' Jud Sheetal ' in Bihar ' s fountain , ' Satwani ' Festival is celebrated in Magadh ' .
