Man Ki Bath, Firbervori 2019 My favorite countrymen, greetings
It's so heavy that Man Ki Bath starts.
Ten days ago, the Great Mother lost his heroic sons.
These heroes have lost their lives to protect our 125 crores of the country.
To sleep peacefully in the country these valorists have saved us by losing their indolence.
After the death of Veer Jawans in Pulwama warrior, all the people across the country, filled their minds with obsession, aspiration.
The families of the dead wolves started feeling from the nest.
You, against this urgeous violence, have the appreciation of every Indian in my mind.
This is the feeling of every humanitarian community that believes humanity in the world.
I am grateful to every Indian soldier who deserves his life to protect the Mother of India.
This sacrifice gives us constant inspiration to destroy gratitude.
It strengthens our vision.
Forget many differences, social evil, territorialism, etc., we must face all these issues facing the country.
Because we should be stronger, determined, stronger than the first step we put against gratitude.
Our warriors are always showing incredible braveness, persecution.
They watched the magnificent power to establish peace.
The same ability, the attackers came to work to answer their language.
You're gonna see how you took action within 100 hours of the attack.
The guys, imagined to destroy those who helped them.
After the martyrs, media has inspired their family members.
That's what the nation gave strength to patience.
Ram Niranjan, the father of the martyr Ratan Thakur of Bagalpur in Bihar, gave us so much inspiration in such sad moments.
He also sent his second son to fight with enemies, and told him to fight even if necessary.
The martyr of Jagatsinghpur Talu of Orissa, Prasanna Sahu's wife, seeing the courage of Mina, the Yawat country greeted her.
Stop your only son, C.
R.
P.
Swearing to the F.
As soon as the hero soldier held the national flag, Vijay Shoren Parthiva body reached the Gumla of Jharkhand, his kid, I said I would also reach the army.
This chicken is the pleasure that every child in India tells us all.
We're seen in the houses of our heroes, heroes, monsters.
There's no refuge in any one of the martyrs.
Their families don't even fail in it.
The martyr Vijaya Maurya family of Deoria, the father of Tilak Raj of Kangda, son of the martyr Hem Raj of Kota, is full of inspiration for every family of these martyrs.
I'm doing ourselves for the young man, trying to understand, knowing the feelings they displayed.
What is the patriot
We don't have to go to the old events of history to know anything, penance.
The living witnesses in front of our eyes are inspirational examples of the future of India of Ujwal.
My favorite patriot, welcome and welcome, all of us are waiting for war memorial symbols.
Those waits are now complete.
The interest, excitement, the interest of the nation about this.
In the Narendra Modi app, Mr. Omkar Twin from Karnataka expressed his pleasure to become the National War Memorial.
The national war memorial in India was surprising and painful to me.
It is a memorial to preserve the bravery of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the country .
I decided to make such a memorial symbol in the country.
It's very funny to complete this construction in a very short time we'd like to build a national war memorial.
Repeat, i.e., on the 25th of February, we summon this national military memorial together with our crores of people.
It's a little effort to make the country to fulfill their funds.
This memorial was organised near Delhi i . e . where India Gate is there in Delhi .
I have complete faith that daring to see this national military memorial is equal to seeing a pilgrimage for the people of the country .
This national military memorial is a symbol of every kind of gratitude to the soldiers of the country who have given maximum sacrifices to the country after the country's independence.
The shape of this memorial shows the unique courage of our martyrs.
This national military memorial imagination depends on four central circles.
In the first volume, every soldier's journey from birth to sacrifice was painted.
The flame of the survivor is a symbol of the immortality.
The second volume is Shaurya Chakra.
It's a symbol of military adventure, daring performance.
Military adventures are carved on the walls of this gallery.
And then the description of sacrifice.
In this chakra the names of the most sacrificed soldiers for the country are linked to the Suvarnaksharas.
That's the security circuit.
It's a symbol of protection.
This chakra has a sequence of dense trees.
These trees symbolize the soldiers.
This is the chapter of the nation giving respect to the nation's nation's messages to the people of the country, because every Puta army is unprecedented.
Looking at the brightness, to know about the great martyrs of our country, to tell them gratefulness, to advise them, it must have changed as a place to visit this national military memorial.
We're here to live with life, to be protected by the country, to enrich their lives.
It's not possible to talk about the great deal of providing our troops, cops, Para Military troops for the nation's growth.
In the last week of October, I also got the privilege to mark this national military memorial.
This national police memorial is contemplating the continuation of the women police, and the pursuit police personnel to defend us.
I hope you're going to see all the national military memorials, national police memorials.
When you go there, you must share the photographs taken there in social media.
Others also have the inspiration to go there.
They also enjoy this sacred place to see the symbol of this messenger.
My favorite patriot, "Man Ki Bath", you're gonna get thousands of answers, explanations, a chance to read me through different ways.
This time, when you read your explanation, an interesting instruction from Atish Mukhopadhyay came to me.
What does he mean, 1900, on 3rd March, when Britishers arrested Birsa Munda, he was only a slave of age.
Jamshed ji Tata's victory on the same day is also intriguing.
If he's asking for anything else, this two personalities have the whole two different families.
Both of them have compensated all the traditions of Jharkhand, history.
In Manki Bath, Birsa Munda, Jamshedji Tota, both of them, had said that the history of a kind of honored Jharkhand, the tradition of reminding.
Atish Garu, I'm sorry with your opinion.
These two great leaders have only raised the fame of Self India, not just Jharkhand.
Ganu Yavat is gratitude towards India for his compassion.
If we need to reveal any inspirational personality to Man's young man, it's the great pride of Birsa
The British seized him while he was sleeping.
Do you know why they did such an act
Because he was afraid of the British who had stabbed such a big empire.
Birsa Munda, the great prince, also describes the British government, scared of guns, with his traditional oppressors.
In fact, if people get some inspirational empowerment, people's social powers are more than weapons.
The great man Birsa Munda did not fight the British for political freedom.
He also fought for tribal social, economic powers.
He's done all this in his little life.
The whispers filled the sun's life in their suffering victims.
The great man sacrificed his life at the young age of Birsa Munda slaves.
Birsa Munda is born in every place of the country.
There's nothing in the country's neighborhood to run away in the freedom struggle for a long time.
But unfortunately, the stories of sacrifices, beauty, sacrifices of people in those areas have not been beautiful today.
If the personality of the great man like Birsa Munda tells us our unstability, the personalities like Jamshed ji Tata have given the country big corporations.
Jamshed ji Tota is a perfect lucky man.
Besides seeing the future of India, he has also made a strong foundation for it.
He knows very well how important it is to make India a science, technology, and industries hub.
He established the Tota Institute of Science at a distance.
That's where the Indian Institute of Science is now.
Besides, he established many world-class corporations like Tata Steel etc.
Jamshed ji Tataji, Samavesh Swami Vivekananda's ship in America's end.
In one of the major discussions between them, the propaganda of science, technology in India, about spreading.
This discussion is said to be the founder of the Indian Institute of Science.
My favorite patriot Prajalara is the victory of the former Prime Minister of India Murarji Bhai Deshai on February 29th .
This day comes only once in four years.
Surrounded by natural, peaceful personality, Murarji Bhai is one of the most synonymous leaders in India.
Morarji Bhai, the name of Nationai, has been named as the man who has put the highest budget in the independent India portal.
During the difficulty of the country's democracy formation, the country was run by its skilled leadership, Morarji Nation.
That's why they're also paying for him our later waves.
In order to protect democracy, Murrazi Bhai drowned himself in the fight against the Emergency.
So even in his old age, he had to pay a heavy price.
When the government arrested him, he also put him in jail.
In 1977, when he won the victory of the party, he became the Prime Minister.
He brought 44th anniversary in the fifteenth century.
This is why it is important to reduce the Supreme Court's authority in response to the 42th Resolution that took place in a state of emergency.
They're corrected with this 44th anniversary.
Like the 44th Resolution, the parlment, the Pacific Procedures were organized to be published in the newspapers.
Some of the Supreme Court officials have been revived due to this sensation.
In this survey only 20, 21 percent of the recipient rights received have been made without any restriction during emergency.
The President should declare the urgent situation on the recommendation of the Ministry.
At the same time, the urgent state declared once has been decided to increase the limit of time more than six times.
This was arranged for the first time.
In this way, in 1975, as democracy was killed in the Emergency, in the future, Morarji Bhai's determined arrangements were made.
The futures always remember the unparalleled contribution they have provided to keep the glory of Indian democracy alive.
I respect such a great leader for the second time.
My favorite patriot, every time people are so excited about the Padma awards.
Now we're stepping towards a new India.
Therefore we should respect those who go to your work with selfless feelings at a height level .
There are people who bring favourable changes in other life in different ways with their difficulty.
Representative service, social service, most of those who are finished in the service of the country.
Listen to the names when the pamphlets declare, aren't they
That's some questions you're gonna see.
I think it's great success.
Because they're never seen in TVs, magazines, or magazines.
He'll be away from the world of light.
Without any name Kosmu, he believes he's working on the ground by standing his legs.
Yog: The message given by God to Karmas Kaushal is seen living in a way.
I'm supposed to tell you about some of these people.
You must have heard about the leader of the Dautari in Orissa.
The village doesn't call the Odisha of the Canal man.
The leader of Dautari made the canal road for three kilometres by extracting the hill with his hands in his village .
The problem of water logging with his industry has eradicated the problem of water.
Take the Abdol Gafur Khatri of Gujarat.
He did the magnificent work of reviving the genetic art of the Kutch region.
He's doing the great job of providing new art to this ending art.
I awarded the artwork of the Tri of Life painted by Abdul Gafur Khatri to the former President of America Barak Obama.
Among those who loved the Padma awards have been identified as Shebbir Said Gomat servoir of Marathwada .
He's a miracle to serve Gomata for his entire life.
Chhota of Madhuri is the first person to work to make the victims of the victims of the Colongium Festival in Tamil Nadu.
With this, people started the method of organizing small financial systems based on small groups.
Listen to Tao Porchon-Linch from America, you're gonna be communicated.
Linch has turned into a living yogas.
Even at the age of twelve, she teaches yoga to people worldwide.
She has now made hundreds of yogic punishers.
Jamuna Tundu, famously known as Lady Tarjan in Jharkhand, was an adventurous task of fighting with Timber Mafia Tonoo, Nuxalites.
Inspired ten thousand women fighting for the protection of trees and wildlife, apart from saving the wildlife of eighty hectares.
It is the result of the industry that every child's grown-up plant, every girl's maiden dressing ten trees.
The story of Mukta Ben Pankraj Kumar Dagli of Gujarat makes you so much shocked.
Besides being a colony, there was a lot of humor for the adventure of the adults.
It's hard to get the example of such programs.
By establishing an organization by the name of Chaksha Women's Service Kunj, the unsighted children are engaged in making themselves self-sufficient on their feet with charm.
The story of Kisan Chachi i . . Raj Kumari Devi of Muzaffarpur in Bihar is very inspirational .
Women's compulsion, and the hump in the direction of making farm profitable, is an example.
Kisan Chachi added three hundred women to their own helpful friends, encouraged them to stand on their own legs financially.
The village has trained women on various ways of self-employment along with farming.
The main thing is linked to lime farming technology.
The people of the country, and this time, for the first time in the Padma awards, 12 peasants were also awarded.
Ordinarily, a lot of people tied up in the field of farming, even those who owned themselves came to the padmashree list.
It's a living picture of India changing.
My favorite countrymen, I've been trying to share with all of you today about the feeling of a loss of a mind I've been doing in a few days.
Where to go to this country, the Ayushman India's Passport PM-A means the Prime Minister's Public Health Password, wants to meet the people.
I got some chance to talk to you.
A little mother, she's not getting money or treatment.
He's healthy when this team was treated.
Working hard, a household to accomplish his family, is unable to work because of the danger.
After getting married with this group, he became healthy again, lived a new life.
Brother, Sodari Manulara, nearly twelve lakh poor families were found in this pawn last five months.
I've seen how many changes are coming in this group in poor lives.
If you don't even know anybody who's having trouble due to lack of money for the doctor, tell him about this summit.
This package is the case of a bad guy.
It's time for my dear country princess, school examinations.
In a few weeks after the various school boards come across the country, arrangements for board examinations of twelve and twelve triangulars are started.
All the students who write tests, their guardians, all the teachers have my personal heart-breaking purifications.
A few days ago a big program called ' Church on Watch ' took place in Town Hall Format in Delhi .
In this town hall program, I got the opportunity to talk to millions of students from abroad, their guardians, teachers through technology.
The specialty of the discussion on the tests is that there has been a discussion on various aspects related to the tests.
Many things have come into discussions like students are surely beneficial.
Students, their doctors, parents can see the complete recording of this program in YouTube.
My Exam Wireers have many pursuits for the coming tests.
My favorite patriot, speaking about India, doesn't have to be happy about festivals.
There is no day without any festival, without any importance in our country.
Because some years old culture, traditions are at us.
The Mahashivaratri is coming in a few days.
This time Shivaratri came on Monday.
A special significance is filled in our mind when Shivratri comes on Monday .
During this sacred Shivratri festival you all have many purifications.
My dear patriot, I went to Kashi a few days ago.
There I got the chance to spend with some of the elder brothers.
They discussed a lot of things.
Their self-confidence actually influenced me very much.
It's inspirational.
Talking to an emotional young man in the middle of the words, he said that the stause artistic wasn't there.
I'll mix in the activities of enjoyment.
I'm simply asking anyone who misses.
I told you I'd miss the prime minister.
I've done it.
I'm in a lot of confusion.
In Man Ki Bath, I watched all that mixed up how I spoke.
Man Ki Bath did Mimicry.
I enjoyed knowing it, people remember many times other than listening to Manki Bath.
I really was impressed by seeing the power of that lovely brother.
I have a special experience to live with all of you through my favorite patriot, Man Ki Bath program.
A way through the medium of radio, I celebrate the face every month with millions of families.
Many times when talking to all of you, reading your answers, listening to your opinion in the phone, all of you think you're reckoning me as a person in your family.
It feels amazing to me.
Friends, elections to democracy are like a big festival.
The next two months we're all in the potato boxes.
I'm admitting this meeting myself.
Respecting the healthy democracy system, Man Ki Bath, will be the last Sunday narrator of the month of May.
I mean, the month of March, April, after the election of three months of the month of May, with a new belief, with your blessings, our words begin again through Manki Bath.
I'm talking to you for shops.
Another time I'm telling you all thanks for heart.
