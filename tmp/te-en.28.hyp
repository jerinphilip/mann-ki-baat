Chief Minister Shri Narendra Modi in Akashwani, 'Man Ki Bath' (Speak in Mansu) program, television lover of my country Vasulara, I have a great luck during the festival of Deepawali.
The whole country is enjoying the festival of Deepavali .
365 days in India somewhere.
Something's going to be a festival.
Festivals , festivals , festivals are seen in the Indian lifestyle from far away .
Since Vedic period many festivals are being held in India today .
Something had some changes timely.
We have displayed the courage to stop the seasonal festivals.
Some changes have also been done in fair festivals for modern society.
But in these festivals, in their consequences, in the spread of festivals, the main source behind the obtained place in the hearts of the people - is the root source of sacrificing from the individual.
These festivals are useful in spreading the personality environment, extending their limited thinking from the society to the universe.
It's possible only through these festivals.
Festivals appear to be a program to suppress various types of food items .
Whatever taste the food is good for health, such food materials are made in diamond tastes.
We don't know how to use all the crops growing in the fruits of the peasants.
For the sake of health there should be any change in adoption of things .
Our ancestors thought of all these things and made festivals with scientific point of view .
All over the world is the churches of environment.
Nature's destruction is a matter of discussion.
The traditional method of festivals situated in our country gives us more love towards nature .
From children to every person's compassion.
But leave the trees.
But leave the plants, but rivers.
But animals, mountains, birds.
The goal of the festival is to make everybody responsible.
Now we're taking holidays every Sunday.
Well, our big ways, those who do the fucking corpse, the poor, the people of the old age, will have any changes in the sea waters for the amavasas.
At that time science has explained to us that effect on any kind of nature .
This effect also falls on human mind.
Likewise, the holiday to take us is also the history of the transition enclosed with science.
Every festival is like teaching us something, that kind of message.
Deepavali is also like that.
The festival of Deepavali is ' Tamso Ma Jyotirgaya ' .
I mean, it gives a message to go from darkness to light.
Not only the darkness, that's not the light.
Even blind faiths.
The absence of education is also blind.
Podarimu is a big blindness.
Social mischief is another blindness.
During the festival of Deepavali, light the lamps, remove the darkness of the sins of society.
Don't even ruin the chocolates, shit on personalities.
Then the real light becomes the festival of Divya Divya by lighting.
One thing we know well.
That's what goes to you, in India.
Going to the most companions, going to the deserted pool's hut, we think that the Deepavali festival narrates the cleaning program in every family.
It's clean in the house.
There may be soiled plates in the fucking house.
They're cleaning them too well.
It looks like the festival of Deepavali only after seeing them.
Deepavali festival is also an indication of cleanliness.
But clarity is not just clean in one of your homes, your premises must be clean all.
All the streets must be clean.
See the whole village clean.
We're going to digest this feeling in ourselves to see this feeling spreading in our children.
The festival of Deepavali could not be limited to one of our countries today.
All the countries of the world celebrate the festival of Deepavali in some form .
Even the governments of the world.
Even parlment.
The rulers there too.
Part of the festival of Deepavali is happening.
East countries can be.
Can be marketing countries.
There can be developed countries.
Maybe countries developing.
Fuck Africa.
BUT IT IRLIND.
Deepavali is deepened away.
You'll have to know.
The Tapala branch of America has released a tapala bill this time during Deepavali.
During the Deepavali of the maintenance of the Kandadapa, the lighting picture was put in the tower.
Britain's Premier Theresa organized a welcome meeting with people of all classes during Deepavali in May London.
It also includes her herself.
The lights of Deepavali are roaming all around in Britain.
The place celebrated in Deepavali is nowhere in that country.
The head of Singapore has shared a picture with great respect on Instagram .
What has he done in that picture
The 16 women members of the Singapore parlment did not stand outside the parlment wearing Indian traditional snakes.
All this was done during Deepavali.
Deepavali is now celebrated in every street in Singapore .
The Australian Prime Minister sent the people of Deepawali to the people.
In different cities of Australia it has been desired to celebrate Deepavali festival .
New ealand's principal came to our country.
He told me to go to his country soon.
That's the only reason.
He has to participate in Deepavali in his country.
Of all the facts I said is that the lighted Deepavali is giving a message to bring the whole world from darkness to light.
The festival of Deepavali narrates new clothes , apart from eating bamboo , butterflies .
This festival makes children great for young people.
But once the children are playing for misery.
Once all the tapas are trying to get a big voice by putting them together.
There's also a chance of a certain danger.
Sometimes what are the things nearby
Nepu doesn't remember the fact that there's a fire accident.
On the day of Deepavali, such incidents, the fire threats, the news of death cause so much trouble.
On the day of the festival of Deepavali the doctors also go to celebrate Deepavali along with their family members .
The architects who are injured by it or we'll be slaughtered in danger.
My mind for parents, guardians is to be standing beside the kids if they call the tape.
Take care without any danger.
Deepavali is a long festival in India .
It's not just celebrating in a day.
Govarshana can be worshiped.
Boy can be dusked.
The profit can be fiscal.
Cartika can be fulfilled.
Festivals that take us towards all these lights.
With this we all celebrate Deepavali festival .
Let's also make arrangements for Chhath's worship.
Chhat puja in the eastern part of India is a big festival .
This great festival takes place with four days.
There is also a speciality in this festival.
This festival provides a great message to society.
The Lord of the Sun prefers us all.
Obviously, the God of the Sun to us.
The goal of Chhath Parva is to worship the sun.
But usually worship the sun that rises all of us.
But, in the Chhath Puja, the sun is worshipped.
There's an important message in it.
Even though I told about Deepavali or talking about Chhatha puja , it is not necessary for you to provide salutation to all during this festival .
During this time all the people of the country have the need to dedicate to thanks.
Some of the events happening in a few months have left us poison.
Our soldiers are offering them for our happiness.
Our soldiers, security personnel are tricks, penance, industry.
All this was filled with my mind.
That's why I felt like to indicate this Deepavali festival to the rescue staff.
I asked the people of my country to take a program called 'Sondesh Tu Soldiers'.
In all the hearts of the people of the country there is uncommon love for the soldiers.
It's honor.
These feelings are telling you prior to hear by sending messages to Pellubika.
They all give us the right strength.
For security personnel, the messages provided by our countrymen to the soldiers have greatly raised the mood of them.
We can't say it in words.
Children, college students, people living in the villages, disappointments, businessmen, shopping, politicians, players, film world.
They can be anybody
They didn't send a light to the countrymen, they didn't send clean messages for them.
Perhaps someone looks like hell.
The medium of propagation of this Deepavali festival has also been decreed by the mission of the people .
BSF may be, may be CRPF, may be Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rafiles, Boating, Air Force, Patha Team, Coast Guard.
They're all innumerable.
I can't say all the names.
These soldiers are facing many problems all over.
If we celebrate Deepavali festival here the soldier is standing somewhere in the desert .
On the other side of the Himalayan peaks, the other industrial corporation is a guardian at another airport.
So each one is responsible for each other.
At the same time we are all present in the festival , the site will grow a new power to remember them .
The country showed the ability to grow with a message.
I'm really telling the gratefulness of all the people of the country.
The poems with their dreams poetry , painters pouring pillars from their wells , sneezing shouts, singing extraordinary pictures - this way the Saraswati Kataksha has displayed their arts all the time.
In NarandramodiApp, in MyGov, the way people send their views to a flow, the poems, artists expressed their innumerable feelings in their poems, poets, colors.
The humiliating feeling of my country's soldiers is filling me with grief.
How many kinds of "Sandesh Tu Soldiers" to Hash Tyag.
How many kinds of messages have come symbolically
I want to read a poem sent to Mr. Man Ashwini, Mar Chauhan, a symbol for all of them.
Ashwaniji did this.
"I'm celebrating the festival, enjoying, gladly laughing, gladly smiling, I'd like to explain to you this day because I'm all there.
That's why I'm supposed to be the patron of my liberty, because I'm sleeping quietly there.
Our brave soldiers are supposed to be supposed to be the borders there, the treacherous, the supremacy of this country, the mountains, the horror of this country, enjoying you as well as gratitude as you are grateful to you.
She grew up, and the millies were also full of soldiers.
A message was sent by her Telephone.
We're late for this military family's commitment.
"Hello Chief Minister Garu.
I'm talking to Shivani Mohammad.
During this Deepavali the program of 'Sondesh T. Soldiers' was started.
It doesn't excite a nice excitement in our brothers.
I came from a military family.
My husband worked as an officer in the army.
My father, ma'am.
They also served as officers in the army.
I mean, the whole of our family belongs to the soldiers.
Jews who guard the borders, the army officers love love affairs.
That's why they're encouraging great sweat.
I'm also supposed to suggest one thing.
The soldiers, the soldiers, along with their families, the wives, are tricking.
That's why a magnificent message for the military community.
I'd like to enjoy the pursuits of Deepawali for you too.
Thanks to me for you now.
Lovely my country, Vasulara, the Synicougists are supposed to be supposed to our borders.
But they're showing their capabilities every field of life.
Nature can be a compassionate, or peace-surveillance can be anxious, or can be headed by enemy, or inspired by the misguided youngsters to bring back to the main reception of life, our soldiers are pursuing patriotic feelings in the service of the country.
One incident came to me.
Let's tell you about it.
What's the reason behind victory.
So much power comes when you hear that freak.
Everyone knows it.
You'll have to know all that.
The entire region of Himachal Pradesh has become an unusual place of urination .
So far, Sikkim has declared six years of urination as a free place.
Now Himachal Pradesh has reached that list.
Kerala has also reached this list on the 1st November .
How can these wins be achieved
I'll answer this question.
There was a soldier in ITBP.
His name is Shri Vikas Thakur.
The person living in a village of Sir Maur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The name of the village named the person.
This soldier went to his village in the holidays.
The meeting of the village is going on at this time.
He reached there.
There is a discussion about the construction of the school in the village council.
Some families were unable to undergo educational construction due to lack of money.
Mr. Vikas Thakur, who had filled the patriots, had to relieve the lack of education in his village.
On the enemy, this soldier, who smelled the rain of gunfire, immediately took his checkbook and provided Rs 5,7,000 to the village panchayat.
In 57 houses, he wanted to take this money for the construction of the school.
He's supposed to fulfil his village as a non-violent village.
Shri Vikas Thakur has preserved his goal .
Giving Rs.5 lakh to 57 families, he gave an emphasis to the cleaning program.
Due to such incidents Himachal Pradesh has become a free place of open defecation .
Like that.
It's also happening in Kerala.
I appreciate youngsters due to all this.
Telling them gratefully.
There are some villages in the far-flung areas of Kerala.
It's just a fugitive walking there.
Like a village like a wolf.
So people don't go anywhere.
The engineering students living in the city near this village got an idea.
I thought I should build a school in Idmalakudi.
The NCC Cadettes, the NSS Walters, the engineering students, commemorated the construction of the school.
The bricks needed for the construction of the toilet, the cementary material reached the Maramula village by walking on foot on their shoulders all day long.
Everyone finished the construction of the school.
Maramula village has been finished as a village without open defecation.
Due to this the state of Kerala has become a non-violent state .
Even in Gujarat approximately 150 areas have been declared unusual places .
Ten districts have also turned into unsustainable areas.
Hariyana also gave us a clean message that turned into a free place of public exile till 1st November.
In a few months the entire Haryana state has become a clean state.
Today 7 districts have become clean districts.
Even in the rest of the states, the work is very fast.
I only explained the names of some states.
I appreciate all the citizens of different states participating in a unique program.
My appreciations to all the newborns who surround the blindness of the unsettled.
Lovely my country's Vasulara, there are many ways in the Lordship.
If there's another package after a packet, it's gonna have to pay it first.
Nobody's holding that much about this thing.
The new summit will also continue with the old summit.
It's also going to be waiting for the coming group.
They're all running.
In gas houses, there is no need of kerosene in power-powered houses.
But who's gonna ask the government.
Kerosene is also listening.
Gas is using the nu.
Electricity is used.
In such a situation, there is a good chance for those who fool the facts.
I appreciate the state of Haryana in this regard.
Because it turned into a kerosene-free state.
For the people of Gas, the electric power computers have made the list of those who have been discovered with the base card number.
About 8 districts have become kerosene administered districts.
As soon as possible, the situation of change of kerosene-free state of Haryana will soon be seen.
The stealing, the robbers stop.
Environment improves.
The foreign exchange is very safe.
People get comfort.
But only those who shout the flaws get a little bit upset.
Lovely my country, Vasulara, Mahatma Gandhi, are always guides to us.
His words are the fundamentals of our country even today.
Remind the face of the first time that makes a new approach.
Imagine the weak face once.
Think once you're gonna use this fucking way to run.
Think what you're gonna get hurt by your team.
After that you decide.
In the present situation, the time to walk according to the hopes is comfortable.
Remove the dangers.
We have to put one step forward for this.
Our old thoughts haven't served.
Today, the girl, Maga, provide equal facilities to everyone without the difference.
Today girls are also in school.
Magicians are also in school.
Trying to eradicate the difference between the girls.
The government is running a program of vaccination.
Although millions of children are suffering from vaccination .
They're suffering from various diseases.
The program of vaccination program is ' Mission Indhanush ' for children .
This program protects the child from dangerous diseases .
In the 21st century, no longer can help in the villages of darkness.
Electricity power programs are going on in the villages to crack darkness.
We're putting footprints while winning.
What happens if the smoke of 400 cigarettes is sucked in the body by cooking on a sweet pearl after the reception .
She's getting worse.
Five crore families are trying to get rid of smoke.
We're going to be successful in this.
Small businessmen, small businessmen, selling vegetables, selling milk, sparkling shops...
Vernatta Vaddi traders are supposed to be rigged in the poisonous square.
All of them were freed from the poison of Vaddi traders from the paths like Mudra Yojana, Ankura Yoga, Jan Dhan Yojana.
The money goes directly to the bank's account by the base card.
They'll have someone who's getting lobby through this team.
Even in normal life, efforts should be made to remove the tremors.
Not only bringing changes in circumstances.
Please carry out the direct release program from the problem.
Lovely my country, Vasulara, on 31st October, the great prince celebrates the victory of Mr. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Mr. Sardar Patel, the original mantra of India, started his life.
On one side, man's Jayanti festival, on the other hand, Mrs. Indira Gandhi's anniversary.
We must remember the holy men of great men.
But a jewel from Punjab gave me the message.
"Good to the Conflict Minister...
I'm talking to Jas Deep from Punjab.
It's the thing you know.
The 31st birthday of Sardar Patel.
Mr. Sardar Patel, the great man who sacrificed his life to bind the country in the equation formula.
He's the man who brought everyone in the form of equality.
Such a great man was killed by Mrs. Indira Gandhi on the day he was born.
It's a bad thing.
We all know what happened to Indira Gandhi's murder.
How to stop without such accidents .
Don't ask.
Lovely my country, this problem is not only related to a man.
Mr. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, a man who tried to unite the country after Chanakyudi.
History is witness.
The decency brought under a flag, below the same roof of independent India, pieces of Sardar Balbhai Patel.
The rituals of this great prince.
The sad thing is that Sardar Patel lived for equality.
Trying to get equality.
Equality is the last fight.
Because of this, he turned so many people into enemy.
But he didn't make the same path anymore.
On the day of the birth of such a great man, Mrs. Gandhi was killed by many Sardar jis.
On the birth day of a great man, Sardar jeel became a blood specific in his history.
It's a very painful part of us.
We have to move ahead with the equation magic between all these dangers.
The basic formula of our country is unity in diversity.
Languages can be many.
There can be many species.
Popular languages can be many.
The food can be many.
It's our goal to achieve unity in this distinction.
That's the strength for us.
This unity is the characteristic of Indians.
It's their responsibility for all the way to save it.
Responsibility of all governments.
Investigate for equality everywhere in the country.
Increase equality.
Sweethearts, sneak to the nature of the nerves.
Mr. Sardar Patel gave us the sympathy of equal India.
It's our responsibility to create a great India.
The original specimen of unity is the strongest for the creation of India .
Mr. Sardar Patel's life began with the struggle of farmers.
He's a farmer dad.
Mr. Sardar Patel played an important role in participating farmers in the freedom struggle.
The destination of Swatantra Sangram is a great day in the villages of Sri Sardar Patel.
He's hiding the magnificent equation power.
He achieved the miracle with that skill.
Only Mr. Sardar Patel did not limit his life to the confrontation.
He imagined new things.
These days we're listening to Amul.
Everything related to ambulance is known to all our citizens.
But there's one thing that's known to a lot of people.
Mr. Sardar Patel has visioned to set up a collaborative co-operation with his vision.
At that time the name of Kheda district is called Kaira district.
In 1942, he embraced the collaboration of Padi farmers.
Avalid Amool's organization stands for the root cause of the beauty of the farmers.
Alanadah dressed his seeds, now it turned into a great tree.
Mr. Sirdar Patell's getting Anjali in Mansara.
On 31st October, I'm celebrating 'Akta Divas'.
This day we have to remember Mr. Sardar Patel where we are.
Speech to get equality.
Lovely my country, Vasulara, on the occasion of the festival of Deepawali, another festival in this tradition is Kartika Purnami.
This is also a festival of lights.
The messages of Guru Nanak God are not limited to one India.
All men are recommended.
Even today his message is our guidance.
Peace, equality, honesty.
This is the original formula.
Guru Nanak Dev taught the ineffectiveness of the society, the great beliefs and misconceptions.
Alandu reached the unprecedented, racial differences, atrocities.
Guru Nanak Dev accepted Bhai Lale as his teacher.
Guru Nanak Dev gave a message to the feeling of Betha.
We're walking in his footsteps.
Remove the flaws.
We don't get the best guidance than Guru Nanak God to walk towards the humiliation of Sab Ka Sath, Sub Ka Vicas.
During the inauguration of the day, I am offering respect to Guru Nanak Dev from my heart depths.
Love my country, Vasulara, this Deepawali has engraved our soldiers again and again.
My salutations to you during Deepawali.
All of your dreams, the visions are all kinds of triggering.
Success in your life, gladly.
Thank you a lot.
.
