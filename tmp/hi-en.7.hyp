Talking to the mind, July 2018, my dear countrymen, greetings
These days there are reports of good rainfall in many places .
At some places due to excessive rainfall the news of worry is coming and at some places people are still waiting for rain .
India's vastness, diversity, sometimes rain also shows the form of preference and dislike, but what do we blame rain, it is human who chose the path of struggle with nature and the result of that sometimes nature turns on us.
And this is why we all become the obligation of nature lover, we become the protector of nature, we become the promoter of nature, then the balance in nature remains on its own .
In the same way, the incident of a natural disaster attracted the attention of the whole world, shocked human mind
All of you must have seen on T . . , the team of 12 teenage football players in Thailand and their coach went to the cave .
It usually takes a few hours to go into the cave and get out of it
But on that day the fate was better .
When they entered the cave enough , heavy rain accumulated enough water near the door of the cave .
The way out of them stopped .
They stayed on a small mound inside the cave because they didn ' t get any way - and they didn ' t even have one or two days for 18 days
You can imagine how will those moments be when death appears in front of adolescence and you have to spend moments
On one hand, he was struggling with the crisis, on the other hand humanity was united all over the world and expressing the God-paid human qualities
People from all over the world were praying to take these children out safely .
Every effort was made to find out where the children are
In what condition
How can they be expelled
If the rescue work is not done on time , it is not possible to take them out for a few months in the monsoon season .
Well, when good news came, it was peaceful all over the world, satisfyed, but I wish to see this whole event with another view how the entire operation went
The feeling of responsibility at every level was wonderful .
Everyone, whether the government is, the parents of these children, their family members, media, citizens of the country - everyone showed the amazing behaviour of peace and patience
Everyone was engaged in their mission as a team
Everybody's restraint behavior is like a learning subject, understanding
It is not that parents will not be unhappy, it is not that tears will not come out of the eyes of the mother, but patience, restraint, peaceful behavior of the whole society - it is like learning for us in our own right
In this entire operation , a Thailand navy jawan lost his life .
The whole world is surprising that in a dark cave filled with water in such a difficult situation , he did not give up his hope with such bravery and patience .
It shows that when humanity comes together, there are wonderful things
Just need to focus on our goal with a calm and stable mind, keep working for him
In the past , the beloved poet of our country , Neeraj , left us .
Neeraj ji had a specialty - hope, trust, determination, trust in himself
We can give all the points of Neeraj ji a lot of strength to the Indians too, inspire him - he wrote - "There will be a slope, pick up the figures, whatever electricity, the light has gone, then the lamp will remain slopy.
I pay homage to Neerajji .
Namaste Prime Minister is my name Satyam
I ' ve taken admission in 1st ear in Delhi University this year
You talked to us about eams stress and education at the time of our school ' s board eams
What ' s your message for my students now
Well , the months of July and August are very important for farmers and for all young people .
because this is the time when the collages have a peak season
Millions of young men like Satyam leave school and go to collages
If it goes to February and March Yeams, Papers, Answers, then with fun in April and May holidays, results, fix further directions in life, carrier choice is consumed in this
July is the month when youngsters step in that new phase of their life when the Coccus passes away from the concepts to the cut-o .
Students ' attention goes from home to hostel
Students come into the shadow of proessors from the shadow of parents
I am sure my young friend will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of collage life
For the first time to go out of the house, get out of the village, get out of a protective environment and become your own chariot
All such young people leave their homes for the first time, come out to give their life a new direction
Many students have so far joined their own collage, some will be Joining
I'll tell you this to be calm, enjoy life, enjoy the enjoyment of life
There is no choice without books, study has to be done, but the tendency to find new things should be maintained
Old friends have their own value
Childhood friends are valuable, but choosing, making and maintaining new friends, it is a great understanding work in itself
Learn some new, like new skills, learn new languages
The youth who have left their homes and discover those places, know about them, the people there, know language, culture, there will be tourist destinations - Learn about them
New innings are starting , all young people have my best wishes
Now , when there is talk of collage session , I was seeing in News how Asharam Chowdhury , a student associated with a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh , has achieved success while crossing the difficult challenges of life .
He is Jodhpur AI
I
MSE ' s MBBS exam has been successful in its first attempt
Their father , the garbage , beankar , nurture his family .
I congratulate them for this success .
There are many students who are from poor families and with their hard work and passion for the opposite circumstances, they have done something that inspires us all
Whether he is Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is a bus driver in HT or Abhay Gupta of Kolkata who studied under the street lights on the sidewalk
Bitia of Ahmedabad is Afreen Shaikh, whose father runs Lauto Rickshaw
Nagpur's daughter is happy, whose father is also driving in school bus or Kartik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand whose father wages in brick kiln
He used to sell toys at the fair or the Divyang daughter of Gurgaon Anushka Panda, who is suffering from a genetic illness called spinal muscular atrophy from birth, all of them crossing every barrier with their determination and freshness
If we look around us then we will find many such examples
Any good event in any corner of the country gives energy to my mind, inspires and when I tell you the story of these young people, I also remember that story of Neeraj Ji and that is the case of life
Neeraj ji has said that the song is to tell the sky of the earth, I have to call every darkness in the light, I have to head the sword with the smell of flowers, and to wake the mountains of Ga-ga, my dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes went on a news, wrote - Two youths did Modi's dream realize
When we read in , how our youth today try to change the life of the common man by smart and creative use of Technology
The incident was that once the San Jose city of America, known as Technologi Cub
There I was discussing with Indian youth .
I had appealed to them .
How can they use your talent for India, think and do something by taking out time
I appealed to convert Brain-rain into Brain-Gain
Two IDs of Rae Bareli
T Proessionals, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Bajpayee ji made an innovative attempt accepting my challenge
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji jointly prepared a SmartGaoon app using their proxional skills
These Apps are not only connecting the people of the village to the whole world , but now they can get any information and information on their own mobile .
This village of Rae Bareli, residents of Taudharpur, Village-Pradhana, District Magistrate, all the people made people aware about the use of this app
It ' s working to bring the Digital Revolution in App village in a way
The development work in the village has become easy to record, track, monitor through this app
In this app, the village's phone directory, News selection, events list, health center and I
Normation center exists
This app is also very beneficial for the farmers, the Grammar Feature of App works as a Market Place for their product in a way between farmers.
If you look at this incident closely, one thing will come to mind that the youth is living in America, living there, thinking and thinking among them
Many years ago, India must have left but still know the nuances of its village, understands the challenges and is connected to the village
For this reason, perhaps he could make something just according to what the village wants
The feeling of doing something to do with your village, its roots and surroundings is natural in every Indian
But sometimes due to time, sometimes due to distances, sometimes due to ecology, a slight ashes accumulates on it, but if a small spark is touched, then all the things come up once again and they pull towards their past days.
We should also check that even in our case it has not happened, conditions, circumstances, distances have not separated us anywhere, the ashes is not frozen
You must think .
"The honorable Prime Minister, Namaskar, I am talking to Santosh Kakda Kolhapur, Maharashtra"
This is the old tradition of Maharashtra of Pandharpur .
Every year it is celebrated with great enthusiasm and enthusiasm .
About 7-8 lakh warriors are included in this .
The rest of the people of the country are also aware of this unique venture, so you give more information about Wari
Thank you very much for your Phone All
Indeed Pandharpur Wari is a wonderful journey in itself .
Friends Ashadhi Ekadashi, who was this time on July 23, is also celebrated as the grand culmination of Pandharpur Warri .
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
About 15-20 days before Ashadi Ekadashi i . . pilgrimages come out on foot to visit Pandharpur along with palanquins .
This journey, which is called Wari, includes millions of warriors
Great saints like Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram keep singing in palanquin, dance and walk towards Pandharpur on foot .
This is the Triveni of Vari education, rituals and reverence
The pilgrimage Lord Vithal , who is also called Vithova or Pandurang , reach there for their philosophy .
Lord Vithal protects the interests of poor, deprived, victims
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana have immense reverence among the people there, there is devotion
To go to Vithova temple in Pandharpur and there is a different experience of glory , beauty and spiritual joy .
I urge the audience of the mind to experience Pandharpur Wari once obtaining the opportunity .
Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram - countless saints are still educating people in Maharashtra
This saint tradition has been inspiring in every corner of India , giving strength to fight against superstition .
Whether it is their brotherhood or dissolution we get an important message of goodwill, love and brotherhood
It is a mantra to fight society with reverence against superstition .
These were those people who stopped the society from time to time, showed toka and mirror and ensured that old misdeeds end from our society and rituals of compassion, equality and purity among the people
Our Indo-Bhumi Bahuratna is Vasundhara, as a great tradition of saints lived in our country, in the same way the great men dedicated to the powerful mother-in-law, sacrificed this earth their life, dedicated
One such great man is Lokmanya Tilak who has left his deep impression in the mind of many Indians .
We remember the birth anniversary of Tilak ji on July 23 and his death anniversary on August 01
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and self - confidence .
They had the power and intelligence to show British rulers the mirror of their mistakes .
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he tried to sedition him three times in 20 years, and this is not a small thing
I want to put an interesting event attached to a statue in Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad in front of the countrymen today
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, in that land, more than 40,000 people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad from today and during the visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel got an opportunity to interact with him and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was very impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when the death of Lokmanya Tilak ji on August 01, 1920, he decided that he would make his memorial in Ahmedabad
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected Mayor of the Ahmedabad Municipality and immediately selected Victoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak and it was named after the British ueen .
Naturally the British were unhappy with it and the Collector continued to refuse permission for it but Sardar Saheb was Sardar Saheb
He was attentive and he had said that even if he had to step down, he would be the statue of Lokmanya Tilak ji
Finally, the statue was ready and Sardar Sahib did not inaugurate it from anybody but on 28 February 1929 - Mahatma Gandhi and it is a matter of great joy in that inauguration ceremony, in that speech, Pooja Bapu said that after the arrival of Sardar Patel, the Ahmedabad Municipality has not only received a person but has also got the courage, due to which the construction of Tilak Ji's statue has been possible.
And my dear countrymen, the specialty of this statue is that it is such a rare idol of Tilak in which he is sitting on a chair, in it lies right below Tilak, "Swaraj is our birth right and I am listening to this period of English"
Public Ganesh Festival started with the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji .
Public Ganesh Festival became an effective medium of traditional reverence and celebration as well as social awareness, collectivity, people pursuing the sense of harmony and equality .
At the same time it was a period when it was necessary that the country should unite to fight against the British, these festivals broke the barriers of caste and sect and united everyone
Popularity of these events increased over time .
This shows that even today there is crae in our younger legend towards our heroes of ancient heritage and history .
Today in many cities it happens that you can see Ganesh - Pandal in almost every street .
All the family of the street together do organie it
work as a team
This is also an excellent opportunity for our youth, where they can learn qualities like leadership and organiation, develop them within themselves
My dear countrymen
I had requested last time too and when Lokmanya is recalling Tilak ji, I will once again urge you to celebrate Ganesh festival this time too, celebrate with pomp, celebrate with joy, but keep an insistence to celebrate eco-friendly Ganesh festival .
From the idol of Ganesh ji to the equipment, everything is eco-reendly and I would like to have different competitions of the Eco Rindly Ganesh festival in every city, be rewarded and I would like to keep things on MyGov and also on the Eco-riendly Ganesha-Utsav for wide publicity
I will surely reach you to the people .
Lokmanya Tilak awakened self - confidence among the countrymen , he gave a slogan , Swaraj is our birth right and we will be with us .
Today it ' s time to say that Swaraj is our birth right and we shall carry it .
Every Indian should reach good governance and good results of development .
This is what will build a new India .
After 50 years of Tilak's birth, on the same day i.e. on July 23, another son of Indo-Ma, who sacrificed his life so that the countrymen could breathe in the air of freedom .
I ' m talking about Chandrasekhar Azad .
Who will be such a young man in India who will not be inspired by listening to these lines "The government's desire is now in our heart, see how much Baju-e-Kastil is in these lines, inspired many young people like Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekhar Azad "
Chandrasekhar Azad's bravery and his passion for independence, it inspired many youths
Azad put his life on the claim, but he never bowed before foreign rule
It was my privilege that I also had the privilege of going to Alirajpur village of Chandrasekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh .
Chandrasekhar Azad Park of Allahabad also got an opportunity to pay homage and tribute and Chandrasekhar Azad ji was the heroic man who did not want to die by the bullet of foreigners - if he would live then fighting and die even then he would die after remaining Azad . That was the specialty of him .
Once again , I bow down to two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrasekhar Azad ji .
Just a few days ago, India's brave daughter and peasant daughter Hima Das has created history by winning gold medal in Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Winland.
Another daughter of the country , Ekta Bhayan , took me from Indonesia in response to my letter , is now preparing for Asian Games there .
The most important moment in the life of athlete is when he catches the tricolor and I am proud of what I did .
Unity is proud of all of us .
You have illuminated the country ' s name
World Para Athletics Grand Pri in Tunisia has won Gold and Brone Medal in 2018 .
His achievement is because he made his challenge the medium of success .
In 2003, daughter Ekta feared, half of her body's part failed due to the Roadacident, but this daughter did not lose courage and achieved this position while making herself strong
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathunia ji, he has created gold medal in Discus Throw in Para Athletics Grand Pri in Berlin and beautiful Singh Gurjar has also won gold medal in Javelin
I congratulate Ekta Bhayan ji, Yogesh Kathunia ji and Sunder Singh ji salute the courage and tongue of all of you
Go ahead, play, keep blossoming
My dear countrymen, many incidents of August month history are full of festivals, but due to the weather sometimes the disease also enters the house
I wish you all for the best health, the inspiration of patriotism, for this month of August and for many other festivals that have been running for centuries, I wish very well .
Then , once again , they shall certainly have a word of mind .
Thank you very much
.
