"Man What Walt" June 2019 Namskar
My dear fellow, today once again, in this event of 'Man Ki Wat', you're lucky to be faced with everyone.
A few days ago, there was a historic cricket match in Bangalore.
You might have figured out that I'm talking about the test matches of India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan's first international test match, and it was proud of all Indians that this historic match in Afghanistan was with India.
In this match, two sides showed amazing sports.
A magazine Rashid Khan of Afghanistan had played very well this year in IPL, and I remember that President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashrafgani, was tagging me and wrote to his tourist: "The Afghanistan people are very proud of their own Hiro Rashid Khan.
I thank our Indian friends, who made a stage to show our players' sports.
The best of Afghanistan, Rashid represented it.
He's a treasure in the world of cricket, and he enjoys a little - "No, I don't want to give it to anyone."
This match will be remembered to all of us.
Although it was the first match, it's normal to remember, but I remember this match for another thing.
The Indian team has done something that is unforgettable all over the world.
While taking the Indian team trophy, a winner did what he could do.
While taking the Indian team trophy, Afghanistan is playing international matches for the first time, inviting them, and photographing together.
Sportsman spirit and sportsmanship can be what we can feel from this incident.
The best way to find out the talents of the sports society and the credit of our young people.
I'm good at two teams of India and Afghanistan
I hope we'll play and enjoy keeping the entire Sportsman spirit with each other in the future.
My favourite countrymen, on June 21, there's an unprecedented vision.
The whole world has come to an eye.
People all over the world have done yoga with full enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
The Brassil-European Parliament, the headquarters of the United Nations located in New York, the Japanese Navy's fighter ships, all the people have come to the attention of doing yoga exercises.
For the first time, the historic event of yoga was organized in Library, and I was told that many asanas have been demonstrated by women.
In the high snow peak of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China joined together.
Jog crossed all limits, collected everyone.
Thousands of zealous people in many countries forgot all kinds of discrimination, religion, region, color or linga, have given this festival a big festival.
If people from all over the world participate in the celebration of 'Yoga Day' with so much enthusiasm, then why would not it be a lot of enthusiasm in India
The country is proud, when we see hundred and fifty million people, our country's army is doing yoga in three places of water, space and interior.
Some brave soldiers joined Dumbajaha, and some of them yogged in the head of the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our warriors have pillared all of us by yogasaning 15,000 feet above the ground between the sky.
There was a view to see, they didn't sit in the furnace, drifting in the air.
Schools, colleges, offices, parks, high houses or fields, yogvyas, all over.
A vision of Amedabad was spellbound, where about 750 monsters of brothers and sisters have recorded together by yogavas.
Upgraded by the geography, pattern and geography, worked to concentrate the world.
The feeling of 'Basudhaib Kutumbakam' that we have been speaking from the past, our sages, sages, saints, who emphasize, have shown Yoga right today.
I'm supposed to be working on Yoga Awelness, Revolution today.
A practice of Wellness is being carried out by yoga, I hope it will go ahead.
Gradually, a lot of people will choose Yoga as a part of their lives.
My loved ones
MyGov and NarendramodiApp- Two have written to me in this pocket of Mankivat 'Doctor's Day of Asannapalajulai i.e. "Doctor Day". I'm supposed to be.
It's very funny.
We're in danger. We're supposed to be humiliated, but I'm supposed to give to the doctors a day.
I'm supposed to be serving the sermons of the society.
We're supposed to be the supremacy of God, in the form of God, in our lives, in our lives.
Orders are supposed to give birth to us, many times.
A doctor's territory is sick and sick, very simple and simple, and in many cases we're in our family.
They're guided by our lifestyle: "I don't take care of yourself, on the path of health."
A doctor is a sympathetic sympathizer, he's a sympathetic sympathetic pattern, sympathetic.
Indian doctors are unemployed by the ability of the Ajaniz.
As a result, our teachers are familiar with the family members.
Through 'Mankiwat', I'm supposed to enjoy my parents from all over the country.
My loved ones, all the lucky men of America are in the land of India.
The history of India is very finished, it's not the same as the Emmn of Masbadin's Iessmaekon.
This is the last jaiger of India. It's the last privilege.
Emigrants of every segregation of this country, in a legend.
Everyone's in charge.
"Good Chief Minister, Namskar.
I'm Dr. Surendramishbal.
We're supposed to know you're supposed to be here.
I'm Magar-King, a small village in Gorakhpur, Tadwa-Tethak.
Maghar-Santakbir's architectural site.
Samya and the survivors know the human beings.
It's obsessed by the supremacy of society.
My confidence will predict the survival of your work.
My regret prohibition, we are obsessed with the imagination of this subject of India.
"Thank you for your phone.
Yeah, I'm gonna go to 28th.
When I was guzzrat, you must know about the Kabirwadjayagat of Gujarat, I've been supposed to be supposed to be a tribe of tribes.
Did you know, Kabir Dasjiken go to Imgahar
There was a fascinating pride in the kingdom of Emrituha, and he didn't belong to the heavens.
The heavenly guys are deserving in the wilderness.
Maghar-Kapvitramanekraho.
But Santakabir didn't believe this.
This blind faith of yourselves becomes the singer emperor of the survival.
In the middle of his poetry, Sakhi and Doon, he's talking about peace and satisfaction.
Was gonna be a sight of life.
I'm sure the sight of the poet's creation is inspired by the sympathy of the Ajak's age.
Soy Piye, Joe knows Pier.
You don't know Peer after Joe, So Ka Peer May Peer.
.
"Orthodoxy, he is the one who knows the other's sadness.
Those who don't understand others' sadness, they're ruthless.
Kabirdasji gave special emphasis on social coordination.
He thought of his time.
At that time, the traditions of humanity and conflict are going on in the whole world, at that time, he propagated the voice of peace and propaganda and united humanity, worked to remove calmness.
"Wairy Koi Nehi, Joe mind is cold.
Please, please, okay.
.
"Are you telling me the poet, the prince who is the religion, who is the sin of glory.
Anything that anger is yes tomorrow, sorry.
.
"He said, "Not the tribe, what Sadhu is, listing knowledge."
He has requested all the people not to judge any man in religion or caste and respect him in his knowledge.
His priceless singings have effected the same way even after all these days, now when we talk about saint poet Kabirdasji, he remembers a fault.
Where Kabirdasji said, the Programguru Govind Doo kicks, who's got it.
The Bolihari Guru tells you, Govind.
.
"This is the greatness of the guru and that's how a guru will be Jagatguru's Guru Nanak.
Who showed millions of people the path of truth, which has been inspiring people for the last few days.
Guru Nanakdevji has tried to finish the racial discrimination in society and taught all the people to be treated as a member of the same humanity and to mix shoulders with each other.
He said that the service of poor and poor people is the service of God.
Wherever he went, he took a lot of industries to improve society.
Social discrimination has forgotten feeding, where racialism can enjoy clean food.
Guru Nanakji started the narcotics system.
In 2019, the 550th Prakash festival of Guru Nanakdevji will be inaugurated.
My request, come, we're all together with enthusiasm and joy.
I hope from all of you, how will the 550th Prakash festival of Guru Nanakdevji be raised in the whole country and the whole world, what will be new plans, what will be new imaginations, prepare and proudly we celebrate this public festival as an inspiration festival.
My dear countrymen, India's freedom movement is too long, very big, very deep.
The history of the most martyrs.
It's the same history that has been associated with Punjab.
In 2019, the terrible event of Jalianwala Bagh, which has been completed for 100 years.
The incident that embarrassed humanity.
On April 13, 1919, someone had forgotten that black day, when he crossed all limits of ruthlessness and killed innocent, innocent and innocent people.
It's going to be 100 years old.
But we'll always remember the eternal message that has given to this incident, that is, it cannot be solved by violence and violence.
Peace, pride, sacrifice and sacrifice always win.
My dear countrymen, Delhi's Rohini's Shri Raman Kumar, wrote in 'Narendramodi Mobile App' on the 6th July Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukharji's birthday and he wants Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukharji on the occasion of 'Man Ki Wat' I talk to the countrymen.
Ramanji, thank you so much for the first time
It's nice to see your interest in India's history.
You know, last 23 June was Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukharj's morning.
Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukharji was associated with many things.
But his favorite subjects were the Education, Administration and Parliamentary Affairs.
Only a few people knew he was the best vice-changer in the University of Kolkata.
He was a vice-chancellor at the age of 33.
Perhaps very few people knew that in 1937, in the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukharjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur had spoken in the Convocation of Kolkata University in Bengal.
That was the first example when any person in the British regime spoke in the convocation of the University of Kolkata in Bengal.
Dr. Shyam Prasad Mukharji was the first industrial minister of India from 1947 to 1950 and had established a strong foundation of India's progress in the form of artificiality and publicity, standing in a powerful base and stage.
In 1984, the first artistics of free India were based on their plans and far-sightedness.
Dr. Mukharjee had a dream, India would be self-sufficient, efficient and rich in every field of art.
He wanted India to build an integral instrument and with MSMEs, textiles, clothes and cottage crafts.
He got the Financies and Organization set up for the proper development of cottage arts and artwork.
That's why Al I from 1984 to 1950.
ndia Handicrafts Board, All I
ndia Handloom Board and Khadi Village I
Andustries Board was set up.
Dr. Mukherji also imposed special significance on the indigenousization of India's defense production.
Dr. Shyamaprasad Mukharjee had a huge contribution in establishing these four largest and successful projects and other River Valley Projects in Chittaranjan Locomotive Works Factory, Hindustan Aircraft Factory, Sindri Corporate and Damodar Valley Corporation.
He was very emotional about the development of the West.
A part of the Arabian Sea has been saved due to his thinking, consciousness and activism and it is still part of India.
Dr. Shyama Prasad was the most important thing about Mukharjee's unity and integrity in India.
And that's why he had to immerse his life at the age of 52.
Come, we remember the message of this unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukharjee and continue the internal effort to take India forward through goodwill and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, for the past few weeks, I had a chance to talk to all those people who were benefitted from the government's various plans through video calls.
I got a chance to hear directly from the man's face to come out of the file and talk about changes in his life.
People have told their compositions, happiness and sorrow, achievement.
I think it wasn't just a government function to me, but it was another kind of Learning Experience.
And what can be more satisfaction and more than the joy I've witnessed in front of the people at this time
When a common man heard of his simple words, his simple words, his own feelings, it touched the heart.
I knew how the girls from the remote villages of Common Service Center are helping to create a passport from the village old people, from Penson to the common man.
A sister of Chhattisgarh collects ice cream from her, simultaneously supplementing medicines to the nearby villages with a simultaneous simultaneous young man and medicine system of the country, like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand.
The young man in West Bengal, who was looking for a job two-three years ago, is not only running his business with success, he has employed 10-15 people with his job.
In Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa, school students are working on important things like the Western Management in the school's "Tinking Lab" at this young age.
There were stories of such a numerous feeling.
There wasn't a territory where there was no message of success.
I am glad to think that I felt the power of the success of the common man, the power of the country, the power of the dream, the power of the dream, from the success of the government in the entire event.
There are some people in the society, until they say no desperate words, do not talk about desperation, do not work to create disbelief, do not find ways to break apart, they do not get peace.
In such a situation, when ordinary people talk about new hopes, new enthusiasm, their success is not available to the government.
A little girl from a small village in the remote territory also inspires 125 million people.
With the help of technologies, I had very sweet and very inspiring moments to spend time with the people who were beneficial in government planning through video bridges.
And it's compassionate to work, and enhances more work.
From poverty to poor, there is a new inspiration from life.
I'm grateful to the countrymen.
You're 40-40, 50-50 million people joined this video bridge program and gave me new power.
I'm expressing gratitude to you once more.
My dear patriots, I always think they're gonna see somewhere or the other, some good work is going on, there are people who do good.
That's good', I feel it too.
The thing I've seen a few days ago is a wonderful combination, it has professionals and engineers on one side, on the other hand, the farmers working in the field are brothers and sisters.
You might think so much different business, how does it matter again
Actually, the Bangalore Corporate Professionals, I-T engineers, together created a "healthy prosperity trast" and acknowledged this trast to double the income of the farmers, i.e.
Through this trast, they have joined the farmers, built plans and efforts are being made to increase the income of the farmers.
With the new techniques of farming, how can biological farming be done and how other crops can be grown along with one crop, all these training is being given to the farmers through these professionals, engineers and technologists.
All the farmers who were previously dependent on only one crop, so that the crop was not good and the profit was not the same, today they are not only fluttering many crops, they are getting better profits by making the right market of the crop through this trust.
Farmers who produce cereals are connected to this arrangement.
On the one hand, farmers have a major role in this entire range of crops, on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure the amount of partnership and profit of the farmers.
The crop will be good when good species of seeds are used.
Seedbank has been separated for this.
Women do this Seedbank care.
This way women are also connected to it.
I'm enjoying all these young people for this congratulatory effort, and I'm enjoying that the professional, Technocrat, joined the engineering world, came out of their own thorns and came out with the farmers, with the village, with the fields, the streets to join the ground.
I once again know the country's youth and their kind of convincing effort, which maybe I know, I don't know, which maybe some people know, but this is why millions of people are doing some good jobs.
My dear countrymen, the G-S-T system has been completed for one year.
The One Nation One Tax, which was the dream of a patriot, realized today.
If I have to give credit to anyone for this arrangement, I will give this credit to the States.
A beautiful example of GST 'Ko-Operative Federalism', where all the states had decided to focus on the welfare of the country together and as a result, such a large tax reform system has been started in the country.
Till now, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can proud that people of different political thoughts, representatives of different states and different preorty states, despite being there in the G-ST Council, the decisions taken so far have been taken.
There were 17 different types of taxes in the country before GST.
But after the system is in progress, it's the same system all over the country.
G-S-T's victory and honesty is a celebration.
Already in the country, the Inspector royal is going to hear such complaints.
After the GST came, I-T took the inceptor's place with the information technology.
From ' Return' to 'Rifund' is currently fully effective through 'Information Technology' online.
The check posts were also closed after the GST came and the speed in the transport of the business and other things increased.
It's not only time left, it's also seen to benefit in logistics.
GST is probably the world's largest text reform system.
Tax Reform has succeeded so much in India because the people of the country have accepted this system, and this public power has ensured the success of GST.
Ordinarily, the reform of such a bigger shape takes 5 to 7 years to be fully formed in such a large country.
But the enthusiasm of the true countrymen, the flow of the country's celebrations and the partition of the people's power, is that within a year, this new process has made its place, has established and revised itself through the inbuilt system. .
This is a great success, which has achieved 125 million countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I'm waiting to finish the finished wind of the next minute.
Wait, Rail, meet you, talk.
You're very happy, thank you very much
.
