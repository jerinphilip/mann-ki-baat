Talking about the mind, May 2017, my dear countrymen, greetings.
We will hardly forget the heat of this year.
But rain is waiting.
Today, when I'm talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramzan, I give heartfelt best wishes to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community, this holy month.
Prayer, spirituality and Charity are given considerable importance in Ramzan.
We are very lucky that our ancestors have built such a tradition that today India can proud of this, we can proudly proud that all the sects of the world are present in India.
This is a country which is also a people who believe in God and people who deny God, idol worshipers and idol worshipers, all kinds of ideology, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition, We have assimilated the art of living together.
And finally religion, religion, ideology, tradition, this message gives us "Peace, unity and goodwill."
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely be helpful in pursuing this path of peace, unity and goodwill.
I once again wish everyone good luck.
Last time I was talking about "Man."
So I used a word that and especially the young people had said, do something new, get out of Comort One, take new experiences, and this is the age to live life in this way, take a little risk, Invite difficulties.
I am glad that many people gave me eedback.
Individually everyone showed the enthusiasm to tell me my point.
I have not read everything, I have not heard anyone's message, so many things have come.
But, whatever I saw from Sarasari, "Anyone has tried to learn music, someone is trying to try a new instrument, some people are trying to learn new things using your tube, learn new language Are trying to learn.
Some people are learning cooking, learning some dances, learning some dramas, some people have written that we have now started writing poems.
Knowing nature, living, understanding are trying in that direction.
I was very happy and I would like to hear a phone call to you too: "I am speaking initiation.
My habit of reading had almost been discounted, so I decided to read in these holidays.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, then I realized how much struggle has been done to get freedom from India, how many freedom fighters have spent years in prisons.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who achieved a lot at a very young age, so I am requesting you to give some message to the generation of today in this regard.
I am happy that the young woman is interested in knowing our history, our freedom fighters, people who sacrificed this country, about them.
Innumerable Mahapurush, who spent the youth in jails, many young men climbed to the gallows.
Do not suffer anything and then today we are breathing in Azad India.
One thing we have seen that the great men who spent time in prisons in the movement of freedom, they did a great job of writing, study, and their writings also emphasized India's independence.
Many years ago I went to Andaman Nicobar.
The cellular went to see the jail.
Today Veer Savarkar ji is born Jayanti.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a "maji birthdate" in jail.
Poems used to write, write on the walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
What kind of tortures will the freedom fighters have suffered
When I read Savarkar ji's "maji's birthplace" and from that I got inspiration to see Cellular Jail.
There's a flight and sound show also runs the program, it's a big motivation.
There was no state in India, there would be no language of India who would suffer the punishment of black water for freedom in Andaman jail, in this cellular jail, not in his youth.
Every language speaker, every province, people of every generation suffered torture.
Today Veer Savarkar ji is born Jayanti.
I will definitely tell the young woman of the country what kind of torture people had suffered from the freedom we have received, how many suffered, if we go to Cellular Jail and see why black water was called.
Only after going, it is known.
If you ever get a chance, in a way we have a pilgrimage to the war of freedom, surely go.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Although everything is normal, but June 5 is a special day because it is celebrated as World Environment Day and this year the UN has kept its theme - Connecting People to Nature.
In other words, what does the meaning of connect to basics and nature mean
I mean to join yourself, connect yourself.
Connect from Nature means - nurture better plant.
And who can tell this much better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times "ne must carabout a world one will not see what we will not see, our duty is to worry about it too, we should also care about it."
There is a strength of nature, you have also experienced that you have come very tired and if you sprinkle a glass of water on the mouth, then what kind of freshness comes.
Have come very tired, open the windows of the room, open the door, breathe fresh air - a new consciousness comes.
When the punch Mahabhutas have the body, when contact with those five Mahabhutas, there is a new consciousness in our body itself, a new energy appears.
All of us have experienced, but we don't register him, we don't add him in a thread, in a formula.
After this you must see that whenever you come in contact with the natural state, a new consciousness will emerge in you and therefore the global campaign to join with the nature of June 5 should also be our own campaign.
Our ancestors protected the environment, we are getting some benefit from it.
If we protect then our future generations will benefit.
Earth and environment are considered to be the root of power in the Vedas.
It gets description in our Vedas.
And Atharvaveda is completely, in a way the biggest directional texts of the environment and it has been written thousands of years ago.
We have been told here "Mata Land: Sons Ahm Prithviya:"
The Vedas have said that the preliminary in us is due to our earth.
Earth is our mother and we are their sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha then one thing is definitely revealed that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the gain of knowledge and his Maha Parinirvana, was under the three trees.
In our country too many such festivals, many such worship-productions, educated people, illiterate, urban, rural, tribal society, worship of nature, love for nature is part of a simple social life But we need to be treated with modern logic in modern words.
These days I have news from the states.
A huge campaign of plantation runs as soon as rain comes in all the states.
Plants are planted in crores.
School children are also added, social-service organizations join, NSG join, government takes initiative itself.
We also promote this work of plantation in this rainy season, contribute this time.
My dear countrymen, June 21, now the world has become the day to go on June 21.
The whole world celebrates it as World Yoga Day.
In very short time, this World Yoga Day of June 21 has failed in every corner, connecting people.
On one hand, many dimensions of scattering in the world are showing their distorted face, at such a time the world has a huge donation of India.
We have added the world to a formula by yoga.
Like yoga, body, mind, intelligence and soul connects, yoga is also adding the world today.
Today due to lifestyle, due to temperament, due to increasing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to live free of stress.
And this situation has reached even at the young age seen.
Yoga's role is important for taking medicines and passing the day, to live stress free life in such a time.
Yoga is guarantee of both wellness and itness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
From the body, from the mind, from the body, from the ideas, how to walk in an interface of health from ethics - it is possible through yoga.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments of the world about Yoga Day, to all the leaders.
Last year, I have announced some competition related to yoga, some rewards have been announced.
Gradually the work will move forward in that direction.
I have a suggestion and I congratulate those who give these fundamental suggestions.
Great interfering suggestions.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and I said that you appeal that this time three generations of the same family together on the third International Yoga Day.
Grandfather or grandfather, mother-in-law, parents, son-daughter, all three generations together and upload their picture.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow there will be such a good coincidence that yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also think that as we drive the cellie with daughter and had a very interesting experience.
The picture of this three generation, Yoga, will surely awaken the curiosity for the country and the world.
You must send me a picture simultaneously on the NarendramodiApp, three generations on MyGov where you do yoga.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be the picture, which will be Suhane tomorrow's guarantee.
I invite you all.
We have just three weeks for International Yoga Day.
Get in practice today.
I will do something in connection with daily yoga on twitter from June 01 and I will continue to post till June 21, share from you.
You also propagate the subject of yoga for three weeks, broadcast, add people.
In a way this is the movement of preventive health car.
I'm inviting you all to join it.
Since you have given me the responsibility of working as a chief servant and from the Red Fort, when I was the first August 15, I had the opportunity to speak for the first time.
I spoke about cleanliness.
Since then, I have a migration in different parts of India and I have seen what some people closely do Modi
Where are Modi going
What did Modi do
Equally Collow.
Because I got a big interfering phone call and I didn't think of something like this, but I am grateful for what they caught.
This phone call will also come to you in mind: "Pranaam Modi ji, I from Naina Mumbai".
I always see Modi on TV and in social media today, wherever you go, people there pay special attention to cleanliness.
On your call to Mumbai or Surat, people have adopted collective cleanliness as a mission.
Big, big, children have also got awareness about cleanliness.
Many times, he has seen the elders spreading dirt on the road, stabbing them.
The campaign of cleanliness that you started from Kashi Ghats has taken the form of an agitation with your inspiration.
Your point is right where I go.
There the government machinery works as cleaning, but these days there is a celebration of cleanliness in society too.
Five days before my departure, seven days ago, ten days ago, there are a lot of cleaning programs.
The media also gives him big princely.
Now I went to Kutch a few days ago in Gujarat.
There was a huge cleaning campaign.
I did not even see it by adding it.
But when this phone call came, I thought too and I saw that yes it was right.
Knowing how much you can imagine, and how the country is notifying these things in a great way.
What will be the greater happiness for me than that cleanliness has also been added to my visit.
The rest of the preparations for the Prime Minister's reception will be used- but cleanliness will be the key thing.
It is enjoyable for any cleanliness in itself, inspirational.
I congratulate all those who emphasize this cleanliness work.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
Well that's a big fun suggestion.
I don't know, I can't do that.
Now, when you decide on migration, whatever migration you ask, tell them how will the level of cleanliness be if Bhai wants to call me
How many tons of garbage will you offer me
Based on that, I will decide my stay.
I
Dea is very good but I have to think.
But it is true that this movement should be made that instead of giving more things in gifts, it would be good that we will clean so much tons of garbage in the gift-saugaat.
How many people will we save from being ill
How big will it be humanity work
One thing I must say is that we don't believe this waste, it's wealth, a resort.
Don't just look at it as garbage.
Once we start treating this garbage as well, many new methods of waste management will come in front of us.
Young people associated in Start-P will also come with new plans.
The new euipment comes with tax.
With the help of state governments, the Government of India has decided to launch a major important campaign of Waste Management through the help of people's representatives.
Solid Waste, Liquid Waste are going to be available in about 4 thousand cities of the country on June 5, World Environment Day to collect it.
Two types of garbage will be available, one of the green color, the second of the blue color.
Two types of waste emerge - there is a liquid waste and there is a dry waste.
If we discipline follow, in these four thousand cities, these are going to be kept dustbins.
Put dry garbage in blue dustbin and put wet garbage in green dustbin.
Like what comes out of kitchen, peels of vegetables, remaining food, egg peels, leaves of trees and plants etc. are all wet wastes and put them in green dustbin.
All these things are such that work in the field.
If you remember the color of the field green, then what to put in the green dustbin will be remembered.
And the other garbage is like junk and paper, it is iron, glass, textile, plastic, polythene, broken dubbs, rubbed, metals, many things - All these things are dry waste in a way.
Which has to be recycled by putting in the machine.
Well he can never use it.
It has to be put in blue dustbin.
I believe we'll develop a culture.
Every time we have to take new steps towards cleanliness.
By going then, we will be able to fulfill the dream of cleanliness that we dreamed of Gandhiji.
Today, I have to mention one thing with pride - How big a mass movement can be created if a person decides in mind.
The work of cleanliness is similar.
There must have been a news on your ears in the past.
Versova beach, considered to be dirty in Mumbai today, became a clean, beautiful versova beach.
This has not happened suddenly.
For nearly 80-90 weeks, the citizens constantly worked hard and transformed Versova beach.
Thousands of tons of garbage were taken out and then versova beach became clean and beautiful today.
And he took over all its responsibility Yersova Residence Colunter (RD).
From October 2015, a gentleman Shriman Afroz Shah, he got involved in it.
Gradually this caravan went on growing.
People turned into movement.
And for this work, Mr. Afroz Shah was given the United Nations Environment Program (NDP), he gave a huge award.
He became the first Indian to get the Hampions of The Earth Award.
I congratulate Mr. Afroz Shah, congratulate this movement.
And the way in which he added people to all the areas and converted into a mass movement, this is an inspiring example in itself.
Brothers and sisters, today I want to tell you another happy thing.
Reasi block of Jammu and Kashmir in the context of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
I was told that the Reasi Block Open Deecation Ree (free from defecation in open).
I have given Jammu and Kashmir a fine example to all the citizens of the Reasi Block, the administrators there.
I congratulate everyone for this.
And I was told that this entire movement has been the highest level - women from that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He took out torch travels to make awareness.
He inspired the people of the house, streets and streets.
I also congratulate those mothers and sisters with heart, enjoy the administrators sitting there that have made a best start by making a block on the land of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for the month, are constantly newspapers, T.V. Channel, social media, 3 years of accounting is going on in the present government.
3 years ago you gave me the responsibility of the principal servant.
There's a lot of survey, all the Opinion Polls have come.
I see all this process as very healthy signals.
How this 3-year term has been done on every criterion.
The people of every section of the society have done her analysis.
And there is a best process in democracy.
And I clearly believe that governments should be accountable in democracy, public opinion should account for their work.
I thank all those people who took out time and discussed our work deeply, appreciated somewhere, somewhere support came, somewhere the weakness was removed, I understand the importance of all these things.
I thank those who have given critical and important eidback.
When there are errors, there are shortcomings, they also get an opportunity to improve when they are exposed.
The thing is good, it is less good, bad, whatever it is, it is learning from it and with the help of that it has to move forward.
Constructive criticism emphasizes democracy.
For an aware nation, for a Chaitanya full nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am also a normal citizen like you and as a general citizen, the effect of everything good and bad happens to me as it is on the mind of any normal citizen.
"The matter of mind sees him as a dialogue on one side, some people criticize him politically.
But after such a long time I feel, when I started talking about "mind", I didn't even think.
"The talk of the mind has made me a member of every family of India."
It seems like I sit in the middle of the family and talk about the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me these things by writing.
As I said that as a normal human, the effect that happens in my mind, then two days ago, the President of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the respectable Vice President, the respectable speaker, Mahodaya, talked about the mind, Analytical Book Festival.
As a person, as a general citizen, this incident is very exciting to me.
I am grateful to the President, Vice President, Speaker Mahodaya that by taking time, people sitting in such a senior position gave this importance to "mind".
In a way, given a new dimension to "mind" in itself.
When some of our friends were working on the book of this "mind", they had also discussed with me.
And some time ago when it came to the discussion, I was surprised.
A artist living in Abu Dhabi is known as Akbar Sahib.
Akbar Saheb proposed in front that "the subjects discussed in the matter of mind" want to prepare his sketch through his art and without taking a single rupee, Akbar Sahib has expressed his love The things of the mind The form of art. "
I'm grateful to Akbar.
My dear countrymen, the next time they meet, rain will have come in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will have come, the beginning of the new life will be started, and when the rain comes, a new pleasant, a new fragrance, a new fragrance.
Come, let us all go ahead in love with nature in this environment.
My best wishes to you all.
Thank you
.
