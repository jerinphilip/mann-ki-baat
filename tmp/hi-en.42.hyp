Talking to the mind, August 2015, my dear countrymen, greet you all.
Once again, to talk about the mind, I have the opportunity to come between you.
People in far south are colored in the festival of Onam and tomorrow the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Government of India has implemented several new schemes for social security, for general humans
I'm glad that in a very short time, in comprehensive evidence, everyone has accepted these plans.
I had made a small request that on the festival of Raksha Bandhan, we give this security plan to our sisters.
The fat information that has come to me that eleven million families are associated with this scheme since the start of the scheme.
And I was also told that nearly half profit, mothers and sisters got.
I consider it auspicious.
I also give many good wishes to all mothers and sisters of Rakshabandhan's holy festival.
Today, when I am talking to you, the Jan-Dhan Yojana was taken in large scale a year ago.
What is not done in sixty years, will it be in such a short time
There were many question marks.
But I am happy today that all the units of the government related to implementing this scheme, all the units of the bank gathered, all the lives, got success and till now according to my information, about eighteen crore bank accounts were opened.
Seventeen million fourteen lakhs
I also saw the richness of the poor.
The ero Balance had to open an account but the poor saved, saving and deposited the amount of twenty thousand crores.
The main stream of the economy is also the banking sector and this system has reached the poor house, so the bank-friend's plan has also emphasized.
Today more than 1.2 million banks and friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
You will be happy to know that in this one year, Banking Sector, Economy and Poor Man - one lakh eighty thousand financial literacy camps have been installed to connect them.
Only the accounts are not to be stuck and now many thousands of people have become entitled to take overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they also took it.
And poor can get money from the bank, this belief also arises.
I once again congratulate all concerned and urge all the poor brothers and sisters who open the bank's account, that, do not break the ties with the bank.
This bank is yours, you should not leave it anymore.
I brought you, now it's your job to hold him.
All of us should be active .
You'll definitely believe me.
In the past, the incidents of Gujarat, the Tandava of violence, made the whole country restless and natural that if anything happens on the land of Gandhi and Sardar, the country first reaches shock, suffers.
But in a very short time, enlightened people of Gujarat, all my civilian brothers and sisters took over the situation.
Active role in preventing the situation from deteriorating and once again Gujarat went on the path of peace.
This is the right path of peace, unity, brotherhood and we have to walk on the shoulder side on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the past, I got an opportunity to meet the scholars of Sufi tradition.
They got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I tell the truth that the manner in which I got the opportunity to listen to their words in a way like a music is ringing.
The selection of his words, his way of conversation, i.e. the generosity in the Sufi tradition, which is the rhythm of a music, I felt among all these scholars.
I felt very good.
Perhaps the world has become the most important to reach the right form of Islam.
I believe that Sufi tradition, which is related to love, is related to generosity, will reach this message far and wide, which will benefit humanity, will also benefit Islam.
And I also tell others why we do not believe in any sect, but, sometimes Sufi tradition should understand.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days, and I consider this invitation as my privilege.
In India, scholars of Buddhist tradition of many countries of the world are coming to Bodh Gaya, and are going to discuss global issues related to mankind, I have also received an invitation in it, and it is a matter of great pleasure that those people have invited me to come.
Pandit Nehru Bodh Gaya, the first Prime Minister of India.
I am going to get an opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya with these scholars around the world, I have a very happy moment.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I want to tell you specially today.
I have already mentioned this topic in "mind".
You must have heard, I have heard in Parliament, in public meetings, "I have heard about the mind."
I have come to say one thing every time that the government's mind is open about the dispute between the And Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestions of the interest of the farmers, I have been saying this repeatedly.
But today, my farmer brothers and sisters have to say that the matter of improvement in the Acquisition Act came from the states, and everyone felt that if the village, poor farmers have to do good, to make canals to reach the fields, to make electricity in the village, to make roads, to make the village poor, to make houses for the poor, the poor young people of the village have to make arrangements for the employment, then we have to remove the law from the clutches of the Afsarshahi and then it was proposed to improve.
But I saw that so many confusions were spread, the farmer was so frightened.
My farmer brother-son, my farmer should not be confused, and fearless should not be there, and I do not want to give any opportunity to anyone who fears farmers, mislead the farmers, and for me in the country, every voice is important, but the voice of the farmers has special significance.
We issued a rdinance, on August 31, the limit of the rdinance is ending, and I have decided, let's end.
It means that the situation before my government was formed has now been reproduced.
But there was an incomplete work in it, and it was - there were 13 points which had to be completed in a year and so we brought him in the ordinance, but the matter was also entangled during these disputes.
The rdinance is ending, but the farmers are going to get direct benefits, the direct economic benefits of the farmers are connected, we are implementing those 13 points under the rules, so that farmers do not suffer, there is no economic loss, and therefore, the 13 points which were yet to be implemented were left in the previous law, and I am convinced to my farmers and sisters, that Jai-Jawan, Jai-Kisan is not the slogan for us, this is our mantra - the welfare of the village, poor farmer - and then we said on August 15 that not only the agriculture department, but the Kisan Welfare Department, which we have decided to move forward very fast.
So my farmer brother-in-law, now there is no reason for confusion, nor does anyone try to fear, then you need to be frightened.
I have to say one more thing that two days ago the war of 1965 took fifty years and when it comes to the war of 1965, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
"It is very natural to remember Jai-Jawan, Jai-Kisan Mantra too."
And it is very natural to remember all those martyrs who keep the Tricolor flag of India, making it an honor.
I salute all related to the victory of the war of 65.
I bow to the heroes.
And incidents of such history have given us constant inspiration.
The way I got an opportunity to meet the people of Sufi tradition last week, there was a great pleasant experience in the same way.
I got an opportunity to talk to the country's dignitaries for hours.
They got an opportunity to listen, and I was happy that in the field of science, India is doing a very best kind of work in many directions.
Our scientists are actually doing the best kind of work.
Now there is an opportunity in front of us to reach these amendments to the masses
How to transform the principles into equipment
How to add Jab to And
As an opportunity, it has to be carried forward.
I also got many new information.
I could say that he was a very inspiring for me, too educative.
And I saw, many young scientists were telling things from Umang, how dreams were visible in their eyes.
And when I last said in "mind" that our students should move forward towards science.
After this meeting, I think there are many opportunities, there are many possibilities.
I would like to repeat it once again.
Take interest in all young friends, science, our Dutational ID
nstitutions also inspire students.
I have many letters from the citizens.
From Thane, Mr. Parimal Shah wrote to me about the Ducational Reforms on MyGov.in.
Writes for Skill Evelopment.
Sriman Prakash Tripathi from Chidambaram of Tamil Nadu has stressed the need for good teachers for primary education.
Emphasis has been laid on reforms in education sector.
I'm sure my young friends have to say one thing that I had told the Red Fort on August 15, why this interview for a lower level job
And then when Winterview call comes, where will every poor family, widow mother, recommend, whose help will get a job, Jack
Do not know how words are being used
Everyone runs, and perhaps this is also one of the reasons for corruption at the lower level.
And I said on August 15 that I want the liberation below one level from the Interview tradition.
I am glad that in such a short time, it has just happened 15 days, but the government is moving forward very fast.
Information is being sent, and the decision will now be implemented that small jobs will be exempted from the interview circle.
The poor will not have to run for seizure.
Deploitation will not happen, corruption will not happen.
These days guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For health, Khaskar's parents and infant mortality should be reduced, for his work plan, all to Action in 24 countries of the world, together in the land of India.
This was the first time outside the US, this program was held in another country.
And it is true that even today, in our country, almost 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children die every year, at the time of delivery and immediately after that.
This is worrying and scary.
Well, improvement is enough.
India has started appreciating internationally, yet this figure is not low.
Like we got rid of polio, similarly, tetanus in the death of mothers and infants, they also got rid of it.
The world has accepted this.
But we still have to save our mothers, save our newborn children.
Bhaiyo-Bahno, nowadays the news of dengue continues.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its defense is very easy.
And what I am talking about clean India is not directly connected to it.
We see advertisment on T, but we don't care.
The advertisement prints in the newspaper, but our attention is not noticed.
There are ways to keep cleaning in small things in the house with pure water.
These things are being widespread public education, but we do not notice and sometimes it seems that we live in a very good house, are very good arrangements and do not know that water is filled somewhere and somewhere we invite dengue.
I will urge you all that death should not allow us to become so cheap.
Life is very precious.
Children of water, apathy on cleanliness, they become the cause of death, this is not right
There are free investigation facilities available for dengue at around 514 centers across the country.
Living from time to time, investigation is useful for protecting life and cooperation with all of you is very important.
And cleanliness should be of great importance.
These days, from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali, festivals are celebrated in our country in a way.
Why not add every festival to cleanliness now
You see rituals will become nature.
My dear countrymen, today I have to tell a good news to you, I always say that now we will not get the privilege to die for the country, but the privilege of living for the country has been found.
Two young men and both brothers of our country and their origin are also the origin of our Nashik K. Dr. Hitendra Mahajan, Dr. Mahendra Mahajan, but the spirit of serving the tribals of India in their heart remains strong.
Both of these brothers have increased the pride of India.
In America, Race Factross America is a cycle-race, it is very difficult, there are about four thousand eight hundred kilometers long race.
This year these two brothers won this race.
Increased India's respect
I give these two brothers a lot of good wishes, I congratulate, very much.
But most of all I am glad that they have all this campaign Team I
India Vision for Tribal tribes intend to do something .
See how everyone is trying their own way to pursue the country.
And this is what happens when such incidents are heard, the chest gets stuck.
Sometimes due to perception we make injustice to our youth.
And the older generation always feels, the new generation does not understand anything and I understand that the series has been going on for centuries.
Experience in relation to my youth is different.
Sometimes talk to the youth, we also get a lot to learn.
I have met many young men who say that Bhai, I have been fasting in life.
Some people say that I have kept a day in the week.
It's good for my health too.
It's also good for Environment.
And I also enjoy my youth.
Nowadays, bicycles also run in many cities in our country and people who promote bicycles are also very much.
But they are good efforts to protect the environment and improve health.
And today when two young men of my country hoisted the flag in the US, I like to mention the direction in which the youth of India thinks.
I want to congratulate the Maharashtra government in particular today.
I enjoy.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar - The land of 'Indu Mill' in Mumbai - The matter was hanging for a long time to build his memorial.
The new government of Maharashtra completed this work and now Baba Saheb Ambedkar will be a grand-dividual monument, which will continue to inspire us to work for Dalits, victims, exploited and deprived.
But at the same time, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar lived in London - 10, King Henry Road, that house has also been purchased now.
When the Indians traveling around the world go to London, Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the memorial that is now going to make the Maharashtra government, will become a place of inspiration.
I give sadhuvad for these two attempts to honor Baba Saheb Ambedkar to the Maharashtra government, I respect him, congratulate him.
My dear brother-in-law, before the next "mind" comes to me, tell me your thoughts, because I believe democracy runs with public participation.
It runs with public participation.
The country can move forward only by mixing shoulder with shoulder.
Give me a lot of good luck.
Thank you very much.
