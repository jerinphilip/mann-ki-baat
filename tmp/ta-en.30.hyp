On the day of the sounding Monkey Pat's program, the voice of the mind, the people of the country, the salvation.
29th August, the birthday of Hawky Sportsman Tyaan Chand.
This day national sports are celebrated throughout the country .
I'm trying to show them my memorable flowers.
In this case, I'd like to remember all of you about his partition.
In 1982, 1932, 1936, while playing the games of the games, he has done an important task of gaining gold for India.
I'm asking you about the name of Gricket's priest, the name of the Fraudman.
He's also talking about Tyaan Chand, he's putting goals in Hawky like he scores goals like like runs, cricket runs.
Tyaan Chand was found to be the example of the exhibition and the great patriotism shown in the game.
During a Hawky competition in Kolkata, a sportsman accompanied by the guy, Tyaan Chand hit his head.
At that time, there were only 10 minutes to get rid of the cat.
Tyaan Chand, they put 3 calls in that ten minutes, and I've put counts for the wound.
My countrymen, whenever you come to mind, there are colors that have many suggestions, narendramodiap, in mygov confusion.
They're different types.
But this time I'm sure I'm supposed to tell you about Rio Technic.
It looks very commendable to see the pressure given to the Prime Minister of the country about this kind of interest in the people about the Rio Template.
Even the cricket has interest in other sports of the Indian people, it's all awakening, so many information is known.
I've also become a very numb factor in order to release this message.
Mr.
Azit Singh has written in the narendramodi app, please, this time, in the minds of women children, talk about their participation in the field of sports, because they have gained the prospect of the country by winning the rio on the other side.
Mr. Like that.
It's written by the Christians that you need a proposal, this time talk about silver, sakshi, Deepa Karmankar.
Our women are burying you with the troubles we got.
Our daughters have proven each other that you're less than anyone.
Among these women, one of the North India, one of the South, one of the East, the other of India.
It appears as if the daughters of India are accepting the responsibility of enjoying the importance of the country.
In MyGov's combination, Shiker Tagore wrote that we can work more specially in the FTMA.
He further says, the valuable motivation sir, you live me for two things we've received in Rio.
But I can only tell you that you're not interested in the question of whether our actions were special.
There's a need to make a long clear journey to the game games.
Our parents only pay attention to the study today.
Even now in the community the sports are seen with the sports of time .
We have to change this idea.
The community needs to be encouraged.
Which one can give this work better than you
Mr. Like this.
Satyprakash Mehra is also written in the narendramodiap - in the voice program, the extra-curricular accities were insistent on the need.
Somehow this feeling has reflected thousands of letters.
The fact is that we don't have to change what we can't function according to our negatives.
We've got two pieces in the tragedy.
But even if there is no doubt, you can see that in many matters the first time the sportsmen of India showed great potential.
In the shooting section, our Abhino Bindra took the fourth place, he lost trouble in a very small difference.
In the Gymnastic game Deepa Karmankar has shown a miracle even if he can get 4th place.
At least the difference was ruined.
But how can we forget that he's the first Indian woman capable of the last international cricket, too
Like this, the Tennis Magazine happened in Sania Mirza-Rohan Popanna joint.
In the Athletics section, we're working this way specially.
B.
T.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalida Babar has captured the last competing of the truckfield.
In the last 36 years, the first funny Hawkip Magazine has succeeded in getting the knock out position.
Our weight is very strong, but here's a funny thing, the entire combination of the golden organdina is in the same ball, who knows who they swear
It's the weight of India.
It's okay to have time for us.
In Baxing, Vicas Christian Yadav came to the final stage, but he couldn't get the whisper.
Several warriors, for example - Atiti Ashok, Tathu Pokhnal, that was a very important activity of Thas.
But I'm more than the people of the country, we have to do.
But till now, if we continue to act as we act, we'll have to come back to disappointment.
I'm reporting the information about a team formation.
The Government of India washed it deeply.
The world will find out what kind of activity is.
We're gonna be dealt with the fact that we can function well in the field.
2020, 2025, 2088, with a vision of telescope, we need our plans.
I'm asking the state governments to choose a few games to stay, to show your strength, to see what we can roll in the game in the world, what can be partialized in every state.
I'm supposed to be in the confluences of the world that the game should be engaged without any serious concern.
That's all the interesting Indian citizens I want to leave, send your suggestions to the narendramodiap.
Listen to the government, the conclaves will give their descriptions to the government after they are engaged in deliberation.
After the state governments rebelled, they sent their advice.
But we will fully prepare ourselves, the 125 crores of people with 65 percent of the youth will be ahead with the vision of the most important position in the world.
My countrymen, teachers on the 5th day of September.
I've been spending a lot of time with teachers every day for many years.
I've been with him as a student.
I could learn a lot with these little boys.
According to me, the teachers are not only on the 5th day of September but also on the day of education.
But this time when I had to go to the G20 square foreigners, it appeared that I would be feeling in the hoof of the mind today.
How important is the place for Mother in life, that is the place of the teacher.
We've seen teachers with more than us.
They dedicate their lives to their seats, for their students.
In today's times, after Rio-Tomperium, Bullela Kobishant is talking about them.
He's a sportsman, even a good teacher at the same time.
I've seen him as an excellent teacher today as a sportsman.
Teachers daily, Bullela Cobisonnd tells her, her sword, her fullest interest in the game, to enjoy him in the victory of Billower.
We always feel the participation of teachers in our lives.
The 5th day of September, the former President of India, Dr.
The birthday of Lord Krishna
This is the day we're following teachers everyday.
He tried to live himself from a teacher even if he had taken any position in his life.
Not only this, he always says he's never gonna die, a student inside a good teacher.
Even after the president of the state, he lived in a scripture.
Your thought as a student was alive.
It's a wonderful life, Dr.
Radhakrishna has shown us alive.
The memories of my teachers are green.
Because they've always been your hero in a small village I lived.
But today, in the event of 90 years of age, I'm convinced that I have been receiving a letter from a teacher for the month of Mada.
In the same month, the books of the books, from which the papers were also found in it.
I've done it all the month, and I've been observed to be observed to be wrong with his eyes.
Something's like he's getting me in class even today.
Even today, he comes to give me some kind of far-flung education.
I'm supposed to think how pearls can write to him in this filthy age when he sees his handcuffs at the age of 90.
Because if my handwriting is so bad, anybody writes beautifully, then I feel very respected.
Maybe your experience as I experienced.
If your teachers get what benefits you have in your life, you'll tell it to be worldwide, the teachers will have a pride that will change in our eyesight.
It is our responsibility to increase the pride of teachers in society.
If you're taking some smoking with your teachers, if there's any possibility of your teacher's business, you must be in the narendramodiap if you're talking about your editor.
It is a matter of valuable fact that the participants of the country's teachers are looking at the students.
My countrymen, we're celebrating the Ganesha square in a few days.
Ganesh relievers
Our country, our community, our families, we want us to be without everybody's living restrictions.
But when we talk about the Ganesh square, it's a natural thing to revert our memories about the Logamanya Bridge Tilkar.
The tradition of celebrating Ganesha square in social style is the wood of Logamanya Dilkar .
He changed the day of the nation's awareness, the time-related by the Ganesh gathering.
Social culture has become daily .
Ganesh square is argued about all the things that touch social life.
There was a new lecture in the society, a new evolution programme.
Besides this, there is a mantra given by him - Svarajya must be the center of our vagina.
The freedom struggle must be powerful.
Not only in Maharashtra but today even Ganesha square Nadeng is not celebrated socially.
All the young people are busy trying to celebrate it.
In addition to this , some people have been engaged in the efforts of the Logamanya Dilkar who has made it feelings.
Appears about public matters, runs articles, competes up to column.
The scenes gathering in it are showing artistic lights to touch the community .
In a way everyone's awareness is carried out by the Ganesh square of the society.
The Logamanya Dilkar Swarajya has given us the name of our genetics.
But we are now independent India.
Isn't that our genius, right now, the genius of the same community
We'll move towards good sight.
The primarily objective of our goodwill is that we cannot give goodwill to this mantra by the Ganesh square of the community
Come on, I'll call you.
The truth is the powers of the community.
They give a new life to the society, for a single person.
It's impossible to live without walking.
But it's necessary to change it for the time.
This way specially Ganesh square has written a lot about Durga Puja .
They're concerned about the environment.
Mr. Shankara Narayana, on behalf of the President, Moti, don't use the idols of the plaster of Paris that you're supposed to explain through the voice program of your mind.
Why don't we use the soil of ponds in the village
The idols made by Plaster's Paris aren't good for the circumference, but other scientists show their concerns right.
I'm gonna urge you all to relieve our old tradition using the idols of the soil, the idols of Turka.
Conservation of environmental protection, protection of our rivers and pools, the safeguard of the micro-life living in the water from the pollution that occurs in them - these are also meat services
Ganesh concerts.
In such a situation, we shouldn't create a generator's idol.
I don't know how you take what I'm saying.
But I didn't just say that, the guys say.
I've been asking you many times.
A sculptor of Pune, Mr. Abhijit Torbale, Nisark Mitra, Vigyan Prophetini, Nicharak Kata of Barparpa, Gyan Prophetini of Pune, Kirkawasa RAJA King of Mumbai.
Many types of structures and personalities pursue a lot of confusions in the creation of soiled Ganesh statues .
It's also a social service that a Ganesha square is not polluted for the environment.
Turka Puja is still a long time.
The idols of traditional idols were engraved by such mud idols .
We will take care of our ponds, the soils of the rivers that they will protect the environment.
Your survivors are very nice to your survivors.
I am decorated with the devotion of Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa on the 4th day of the month of September .
Mother Teresa is engaged in the service of her lifetime.
He was born in Alphenia.
His mother's word is not English.
But he turned his life into a complete effort to lay down on the service of comrades.
It is natural that when Mother Dharsa , who served for the labourers of India , has now been given the reverence of pilgrimage .
This event takes place on the 4th day of September.
In that event, the Government of India, the Secretary of State for Communications, Mr. Sushma Swaraj, has decided to send a jurisdictional representative team there from the ranks of 125 crore people.
We've got every penny from the devotees, rishis, priests, great men.
We're getting something from them, and learning, understanding good actions.
When I'm a campaign that's a progressive thirst in the people of the country, how big it makes
People are seen in the form of energy macation power.
In the last few days, the Government of India has been engaged in a successful effort to pursue the Ganges, to clean the Ganges, to the people.
The heads of the villages living on the banks of the Ganges took a meeting at Allahabad on 20th day this month .
They were men and women.
They came to Allahabad by calling us, all these village leaders took a witness to the Ganges Mother, the practice of expulsion in the open shores of the Ganges should be immediately finished and the drainage dressed and the entire participant of the Ganges was also supposed to be ruined by the Ganges.
For the sake of the meeting all these village leaders came to Allahabad , from Uttar Pradesh , from Uttarakhand , from Bihar , from Jharkhand and from West Bengal .
And for all of you who came, I'm warning my life.
All the states of the Government of India who have fulfilled this important work, the ministers also have my own lives.
The first of the five State Governments, who helped to take the main steps of the Ganges by mixing the power of the people, demonstrate my greetings.
My countrymen, some things, sometimes touch my mind.
There is a special recognition in my mind on those who make a chance.
On the 15th day of the month of July , one of the more than 1700 schools of Chhattisgarh in Kabirtham district .
More than 25 lakh students write letters to their parents socially.
Some people in English, some in Hindi, some in the language of Satiscuit, have to spend their homes in their written letters.
They thought they had to settle the toilet, some boys wouldn't have written even if you weren't celebrated this year, but certainly the toilet was finished.
Girls from seven to 17 years of age did this work.
Whatever extent it was affected, what kind of emotional effect was made, the next day when they came to school, parents, wrote a letter to the teacher.
In which they were requested to finish the toilets within a certain date.
My friends, who enjoyed such an idea in the mind, whom my friends were engaged in this kind of effort, those students who made me a luggage to your kids with a letter written and finish the duties within a date.
That's not what we're gonna predict
There is a 16-year-old Malamma woman in Kopal district of Karnataka.
This lady has committed suicide against her family.
He didn't leave taking everything as food.
Anything he didn't eat sweets or sweets to slaughter you, or slaughter good clothes.
It's just for the girl child Malamma's fate to have a toilet at home.
In the family, there is no economic condition to make such a clutches, but the woman is supposed to be a prediction, not to lose her satyagraha.
It was found that Mohammad Shafi, the head of the village, was engaged in the satyagraha of Malamma.
Look at the importance of village leader Mohammad Shafi, who arranged for Rs 18,000, had given a trap to the toilet within a week's time.
Look at the culture of a village head like Mohammad Shafi, the power of the magic of the female child Malamma.
What is the power of the people
It's the way to find out how the problems are solved.
I have a dream of every Indian dweller in the people of the country, pure India.
It's turned to some Indians.
Some people have made it the target of their lives.
But everybody is connected to it in some way, everybody is dragging a golden participant.
There are daily reports about how new efforts are being made.
We'll invite the subjects of this subject in the synthesis of the darkness that you'll send it to the government after you're prepared in a quantity of 2 minutes, 3 minutes.
In between these competitions will be held on the 2nd day of October, the successors will be recognized on Gandhi Jayanti, which will be awarded.
I'll invite TV channels to arrange competitions by telling you to make such agreements.
The creative ability to pursue a power to enhance, to get new ideas, to know new methods, to get new predictions, all of which will be done by the simple artists, through the partition of the people.
There's no need for a big studio to make a picture, big camera.
Nowadays you can make a picture using the camera in your mobile phone.
Go ahead, let me invite you, come.
I have always come from the efforts of India that our relationship with the people of the country should be deep, natural and alive with our country.
A matter of great importance has been drawn in the past few days.
He started a new program called Akashwani Maitre Centre in Kolkata.
Many people may find out the question that a radio channel should be started by the kingdom of the country.
But it's not a normal channel of radio.
It's a great effort.
Community is our country.
We know that the traditional and western regions are the only cultural nutrition.
Here's Akashwani Maitrey, Bangladesh Bethar Radio and the border.
Together, people speaking Bengali language on both sides will enjoy hearing audience.
Connecting people, the biggest partition of Akashwani.
The President has put it initiated.
I'm supposed to describe my thanks to the territories associated with us to complete this work.
I'm supposed to appreciate my appreciation to the friends of the Airways in order to share your partnership even in the irrational principle.
My countrymen, you all will be the Prime Minister of the country to me, but I'm a man like you
That's why sometimes my mind gets wet by touching some sensitive events.
That feeling gives full senses to new energy and new predictions.
They give you the instruction of slaughtering something to the people.
My heart touched a letter that came to me a few days ago.
It's written a mother of only 84 years old.
If the relaxed teacher hadn't asked if he didn't disclose his name, I must have named him.
I'm gonna forget about it, asking me you're gonna hate the jewelry.
But a few days ago someone came and gave me your letter to me.
Thank you for deserving the manifestation and you conveyed me the written letter.
I believe that the Prime Minister of India has written letters on the basis of me as compared to the Padmasri Award.
I know you've been trying to make a letter from my level to whom the folks, who tricked all the burnt jewels, who gave it to those who were slaughtered.
It's an attempt to write letters to most of a million people.
According to this program only I have reached this letter .
He wrote that you're doing well.
And he writes, I'll touch a relaxed teacher, and in some years my age is 90.
If you've been driven out as a liberation of evil greetings, I'm sending my dress of Rs 50,000, he'd use this population for the work of liberating smoke of drunken mothers.
Can you observe yourself as a simple teacher who keeps his relaxation as a simple teacher who smokes the poor mothers who smoke that smoke will give 50,000 rupees to the smoke
It's not about 50,000 rupees.
The thing is related to that mother's feelings.
My belief about the bright future of the country is only because of the blessings of millions of mothers and sisters.
He didn't write to me in the form of a letter written by the Prime Minister.
I've been writing my brother Moti in a very simple way.
I'm sucking the symptoms of that mother, and I'm sucking the symptoms of the mothers of India, who are trying to seduce the others with trouble.
My folks, we've been abducted last year due to dryness.
But this month of August has been given the fear of floods.
Some parts of the country were flooded again.
State governments, central governments, museums, social structures, civilians have tried to be sheltered.
But remember some of the actions that took place between these terrible floods.
We remember the month of August this year, what's the power to live together, how will the effect be on all the skin riding with the skin.
In 2016, the political parties in front of the month of August, 90 parties in Nadeng, all the political parties in the court, who were all involved in the Serk service tax.
Appreciation for fulfilling this will be done by all political parties.
This is an excellent specimen of what the favour of travellers in the same direction connected with all political parties.
Likewise, in relation to the situation in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country, connected with the land and environment, have argued about the problem of Kashmir in the same hole.
Through this, the message was released to the world, sent a message to the disciplinary powers, the people of Kashmir expressed their understanding.
After talking to all the political parties regarding Kashmir, one thing was well known.
If I say that I'm gonna hid it in two words, they're supposed to be united, you're good.
These two words are mixed with you as the chief minister.
If there is any life in the Kashmir, it may be a life of a young man or a protector of the warrior, the loss is what is ours, ours is ours, our belief is ours, the faith of 125 million people, the village head and the hope of all of the Prime Ministers of the country.
In order to create peace in the Kashmir, small slaves must be replied to these slave boys one day.
I'm in the country, the country's largest, the rest of the world.
In the form of a society, in the form of government, it is the responsibility of ours to connect this country with separation.
We're gonna get more nervous to the things we advise to unite, make them very advanced, then the country can move towards a vibrant future, walk.
I believe 125 million people in the country.
With this, I finish the hole of the mind today.
Thank you very much.
.
