In Akashwani, 30th July, 2017, the Prime Minister of the Nation, Manki Bath (Speak in Mansu), is full of fond of my country, Namaskara.
Man's mind is very paramount in the rainy season.
Animals, birds, stairs, nature, everybody become enchanted by the rainy season.
But whenever rain falls distorted, the power to create destruction seems to be so much for the water.
Nature gives us life.
Select our concerns.
But sometimes the nature of earthquakes, floods creates so much destruction in its terrible form.
There are changes in the environment due to the changing season.
Its effect is too fast.
In the past few days, in some areas of Assam, North-Eastern regions of India, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, natural danger had to be faced due to great pride.
How much is being monitored in flood areas.
Help programs are going on in a wide range.
My friend members of the Ministry are also going to the place where they can.
State governments also provide the best support for flood victims in their own methods .
In such circumstances, the people who work with social institutions, cultural institutions, civilians are helping them unanimously.
The Government of India, the military personnel, the Air Force War, the NRF, and the Armed Forces, enjoy themselves to help their lives in such times.
People's life becomes very dirty due to floods.
All the crops, animals, fundamental facilities, roads, electrical, information mediums etc. are affected.
Especially when our farmers, our brothers, spoiled the crops, they did not damage these Schurence companies, especially the Clim Settlement to the farmers, they made plans to remain unprecedented.
The 24-hour control room help line has worked 1078 continuously to face flood situations.
People are also telling their problems.
With the unprecedented absence of most of the areas before the rainy season, all the government systems have been kept in mind.
Keep NRF Bridges in work.
They'll do all the works of making explosives everywhere, teaching them what they do, determining volunteers, locking up the public sector on one side.
These days we are getting environmental information beforehand.
Due to the inconvenience of technology, space science also has a great role in improving the environmental estimation.
Gradually, if we do our work according to this environmental information, we can save us from the losses.
I'm thinking that most people of the country are more than me when I'm ready for the "speaking" program.
This time, how many answers to JST, phone calls, people are still expressing their joy, all the sympathies.
I'll call you a phone.
"Garoo, Chief Minister of Namaskar, I am.
From Good Gov.
I'm talking to Garg.
I've been very impressed, listening to the context of your Chartered Accountants Day.
Last month, on this date, our country's goods and services have come into operation.
Do you want to say if the government has been successful in the last month
I want to know your thoughts in this matter.
Thank you.
GST came in operation and spent almost a month.
Benefits have also started to appear.
Because of JST, I'm enjoying a lot of joy when I get answers from someone who says how the cost of things they're buying is cheap.
I'm scared of something that's going to happen in the beginning.
But now we're learning all things slowly.
The business is easier than the eastern regions, remote hilly areas, people living in the jungles will enjoy me writing the answers.
Especially consumer believes in the businessman.
The traffic and the Logistics sector are supposed to have the impact of JST, now.
Tracks don't come up.
It's easier to decide the distance.
Highways have been cluster-free.
Due to the increase in the speed of trucks pollution also decreased.
The bulls are also reaching soon.
With this comfort, the economic liquid also strengthens the speed.
It takes too much time to do more resources than transport and logistics sector because the tables are left out.
Therefore new gods have to be built in every state .
JST, I called 'Good and Simal Takes', really produced a favourite effect at a very short time on our economy.
So fast-free changes, the rapid migration registration has created a new belief in the country.
The pupils of the economic system, technical experts observe the GST experiments in India and make a precedent sometime before the world.
It's a Case Study for all universities in the world.
Because at such a great height, such a great change, this huge country, with the promulgation of millions of people, is a very big task to successfully run ahead.
The world will definitely examine this matter.
Now GST came into operation.
All states have the responsibility, part of it.
All decisions are taken together by the state, central governments.
The result of that uniform decision is that no weight should fall in the poor trench.
What was the cost of something before JST, now in the new circumstances, how much that cost is all the numbers you can know better through your mobile phone at JST app.
A country is really a big dream of a single dog.
In the matter of GST, I saw how difficult all the government employees settled from the Tahsil level to the Government of India worked.
There's a very good, affectionate environment between the government, traders.
It's so important for the consumer to raise confidence between the government.
The officers of all the departments, central, state governments, all of the departments involved in this program are saying my heart-breaking appreciations.
JST is an important example of India's nuclear power.
It's a historical grave act.
It's not just a comprehensive of teeth, it's an economic system of empowering culture with a new reality.
To say a way, it's a social reform movement.
I'm killing all the millions of natives for the second time to make such a big effort successful.
Lovely my country, Vasulara, is the revolutionary month of August.
On 1920 August 1, we are naturally listening to childhood.
The 'Kwit India Festival' started on August 9, 1942.
It is also called the Agastya revolution.
The country got independence on August 15, 1947.
In a way, all the incidents that took place in the month of August are also mainly related to the history of freedom fighters.
We are celebrating the festival of ' uit India ' Taluku Vejar festival this weekend.
But this is called uit India doctor .
Yusuf Meherry Ali knows a lot about the congress he gave.
They need to know what happened on 9th August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of the country were obsessed with any freedom generosity, which is the inspiration for the creation of our emotion.
What is the inspiration of sacrifices, penance, sacrifices, sacrifices given by our freedom fighters
The uit India Festival of India's Freedom is a major solution.
To quit the binoculars of the British government, Yawat gave this inspiration to the country.
It's time for the British to participate in the festival of 'Kwit India' by mixing every root of nindi, village nanddi, township, neglected weekly, poor, poor, everybody's handicapped.
It's the target that reached the terrible stage of janakrosha.
On the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi lakhs of Indians started their lives in the fountain with the spectacle of ' Du Ar Day ' .
Millions of young people stopped their studies and dropped books.
Freedom's mantra ran ahead of the jap.
Mahatma Gandhiji called on the festival of ueen India ' on 9th August but the British government was imprisoned all the big Netals.
At the same time, the second phase is the latest doctor.
Great men like Lohia, Jai Prakash Narayan played a big role in the funeral.
The Cooperation Festival in 1920, the 'Kwit India' Festival in 1942,
Both of these also show us two forms of Mahatma Gandhi .
It's a different form of cooperation embarrassment.
In 1942 the rapidity of the movement grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi also gave the spell of ' Du Ar Day ' .
There's help from people behind that.
There's people's friend.
The people have the vision.
There's people's struggle.
Yawat kingdom fought together.
Once again, once the history of Ganaka turned to India, I think the first freedom struggle of India started in 1857 itself.
Then the beginning of the Freedom Federation continues to be a root in the country till 1942.
This long time has created a generosity of freedom in the minds of the nation.
Everyone's decided to do something.
People don't change the vision of changing waves.
People are coming.
Being united.
Going.
The new ones are coming.
Then they're going to be united all week.
The country has been trying every moment to disperse the British Empire with fingers.
A new situation provided by this industry from 1857 to 1942 reached the last stage of 1942.
The movement of uit India became so rough that within another ID the British had to leave the country in 1947 itself .
From 1857 till 1942 this freedom garden reached all the people.
From 1942 to 1947, all the people with the IDs were determined by the same mind, and this is the reason for the success of giving freedom to the country.
This is like a bullshit of eyes.
Now you'll be associated with the Generation.
We got freedom in 1947.
Now 2017.
Almost twenty-five rats have passed.
Governments came.
Go away.
Arrangements have been made, turned, grew up, growing.
Everyone tried in their own way to get the country out of the problem.
An attempt has been made to increase the growth of the country, to prevent poverty.
They worked in their methods.
He also got success.
The observations were born.
From 1942 to 1947 these idols are also like a hole of conception .
I've seen even the IDs from 2017 to 2022 when they're gonna complicate like these.
This 2017 August 15 will celebrate a visual festival.
We'll end up with that vision at the time of the Independence Garden in 2022.
Remembering the revolutionary day of the 9th August, the people of the country, every Indian on 15th August, will serve this country as a citizen, do it in the family, do it in the society, do it in the form of villages, as a government department, should imagine that it will do it by government.
Conceptions of crores of crores.
Try to make them complete.
Like from 1942 to 1947, the country's independence was miles.
These are, i.e. 2017 to 2022.
For the future of the country of India, let's do the same.
After these, we will celebrate the country's freedom valor.
That's why we all have to make a strong equation.
2017 should be our vision year.
This month of August should be strengthened by competing.
Destroyed - uit India, Population - uit India, London - uit India, ugliness - uit India, uit India - uit India, Religion - uit India
The only requirement is not "doo r die" to wipe out.
To meet.
Need to possibly possibly achieve the ultimate results.
Suppose to survive.
Fight.
Come on, this month is 9th August to run a great day for communication.
Every Indian, social organization, local departments of local institutions, schools, colleges, various organizations, everybody compete for 'New India'.
We need to possibly possibly possibly in the coming eye.
Young groups, student groups, NGOs, etc. can conduct social discussions.
New ideas can be extracted.
We're gonna take the country to which level, as a person thinks I'll provide any support to that program.
Come on, it's our third part in this concept festival.
So, where we're not, we're sure on the online line, I've invited my young friends, my young colleagues, to come forward to support them with creative methods of creation of 'New India'.
Use technologies, videos, posts, blocks, reserves, new ideas.
This propaganda is a fuss.
In the NarendramodiApp, we're devising the uit India uiz for young friends.
This quiz is useful to introduce young people to our country's honourable history, freedom fighters.
I believe you must have made extensive propaganda to this endeavor, all of a sudden.
Lovely my country, Vasulara, on the 15th August, the red fort of the country's sect service provides a chance to speak to the people of the country.
Only the pill that I'm standing.
There's not a guy talking there.
From the Red Fort, the people of the old Corps swoon.
Trying to give the words to their dreams.
I've been giving instructions, suggestions that I should talk about what I should say, from all the countries of the past quarters to August 15.
I'm inviting you to send your thoughts to MyGov or NarendramodiApp this time too.
I read them myself.
I'll try to propagate them when I get it on the 15th of August.
Last finished August 15, the complaint that I heard was taking long time for my reproach.
So I decided to reduce my delivery time this time.
All you're trying to complete forty five, eighty minutes.
I don't know if I can keep the rules for me.
But I'm definitely trying to reduce my happy time.
Beloved my country, I've suggested another thing.
There is a socio-economic science in the Indian economy.
We don't never understand it less.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just enjoyable.
Our festivals, our festivals and social reforms.
But at the same time, every festival of our festival will be connected directly to the financial life of the people.
In a few days, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, Vinayak Chaviti, then Chaviti Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Deepavali.
Such a series of festivals come.
All these are also involved in the financial wealth of poor people.
There is a natural joy in all the festivals .
In the opposite of festivals sweetness, affection in the family, bring sovereignty in society.
Persons, fold the society.
There's a natural journey to cross the guy.
There is a chance to go from Ah to Wayam.
From a few months before Rakhi, till the financial system, the construction of rocks starts in small cottage industries in lakhs of families.
Several types of rocks are made in the week of straying from Khadi.
In the recent times, people like more of the rocks built in the house.
Those who make rocks, who sell the rocks, make sweets, thousands of people are tied up with a festival of daily business.
Our poor brothers, sisters and sisters have lost their lives.
We'll burn the lamps to Deepavali.
Not only a festival of lights.
Not only the festival to bring the glory to the house.
It's connected directly with the poor families that make small soil promises.
But now I want to talk about the festivals, while talking about the economic system of poor people who are drowned up with those festivals, so far about the environment.
Sometimes I think the people of the country are more uncomfortable than me, they're smart.
The unprecedented people have answered me for the past months.
Well, before the planet's poetry, the environment-hit Ganeshhudi said.
Therefore they can make plans from now on becoming the subject of earth Vighneshwar .
I'm so grateful to the people who told me to propagate this before time.
This time there is a speciality for social Ganesh festivals.
This great tradition was started by Lokmanya Tilak.
It's 125 years since the collective Ganesh festivals started.
125 people, 125 crores of people.
Lokamanya Tilak has started this social Ganesh festival for the unity of society, for understanding, for social festivals.
Then, in this parallel, people all together, performing churche programs, reminding the progress of the local telecast, what is the feeling of Tilakji.
Don't force it.
At the same time, we are supposed to worship the Mount Ganesh for environmental protection.
This time I told you before, so I believe you're all about me.
Our poor artists who make idols, workers get daily work.
Stomach is full.
Come on, let's put our festivals in the poor economy.
Our efforts should be made to change the joy of our festivals as an economic festival of poor people .
Ganu is telling many excitements for the festivals of different festivals coming to all the nations .
Loving my country, educational, economical, social sector, players, our maidens, our country's name, our new goals, we're constantly thinking.
All our country's people are also pretending to see our girls.
A few days ago our country's female cricket team has displayed wonderful games in the World Cup competition.
This week, I got the chance of being a fighter with those sportsmen.
I enjoyed talking to them very much.
But, I've noticed that the world's cup wasn't very heavy.
Even in their faces, the fury, the pressure snatched.
I heard my count for those girls.
With them, how much I'm enhancing hopes, that's not failing, it's turning aroused.
When Indian sportsmen were losing we saw in many sports of the country being irritated by anger.
Some say very painfully, without consultation, come.
But, for the first time, our players didn't win the world cup, 125 crores of people put that fail on their shoulders.
Well, we didn't even lie on our girls.
Besides, these maidens were respected by shining.
I think it's a clean change.
"And I see with these girls."
Such luck just got you.
Put the feeling you're not winning out of your mind.
Get the match, you won the minds of 125 crores if you don't win.
I told those sportsmen.
Actually our country is young, especially our girls.
That's how much the country's name is to stand.
Once again, for the country's youth, especially our girls are telling my heartful joys, salutations.
Lovely my country is remembering you again, Vasulara.
The Agastst Revolution is reminding the 9th August.
Remembering the 15th August again.
Till 2022, we're also remembering 75 springs for our freedom.
Assuming every country's citizen, makes an instrument of the ID for its vision.
All of us must bring the country to the highest peaks.
Accommodation.
Accommodation.
Come on, let's run together, let's try something.
The country's comfort, the future is best.
Thank you for many satisfactions, all of you.
.
