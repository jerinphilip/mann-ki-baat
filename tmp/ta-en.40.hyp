My requests to all of you, to the folks of the Monkey Bath program on the 25th day of October.
I've got a chance to talk to all of you again through the voice of the mind.
Today 5th day between India and Afghan cricket competition is played in Mumbai.
This 5-day cricket competition has been called Gandhi Mandela series.
These sequences have a comfortable order.
Two dresses have been successful in two texts.
That's why, the interest of the last competition has increased.
My nickel lives for all the sportsmen.
Today I'm demonstrating my appreciation to friends at the Cantour station of Al India Radio.
When I started the hoove of the mind, many people used to join you, in which the student of 12th class of Kerala, Shratha, is one of you.
The Chunchur station took him to the station once, arranged for an event.
It's sufficient quantity of ideas.
In the 12th grade, Christ's awareness was appreciated by the Christian transmission station, which was awarded gifts.
This activity of Kuntoor Radio Station is also meant to be predictable.
If the entire country's transmission stations do such awareness and activity in their areas, people's attention will be able to repeat milk, and create a new energy for our thoughts to regulate the people's partition.
That's why I'm demonstrating all the companions of Antoor Radio Station, my heart's fullest appreciation and life.
I once again want to convince about Kerala today.
A letter has been sent to me students of Duya Mary Upper Primary School adjoining Siddur area of Kerala.
These letters are special in many kinds.
One, these students kept the turmoil of the Bharata month in a very big cloth by recording their thumb maps.
He sent me the miracle of Bharat Maa, the Indian picture.
I was surprised at first why they put this picture on recording their finger maps.
But after reading the letters they wrote, they've sent me so many big sex messages.
These students didn't make sense that they should be aware of something.
They're doing this as well as aware of their parts.
Their marks are about donating body parts.
They're engaged in awareness about body donations.
In order to increase the awareness of body parts to donate people in the middle, they have been presenting it in many places by dancing and dancing.
These students are asking you in your letter, you're observing your body part donation in your voice program.
Only 80 years old resident of Maharashtra , Rao Suddak , Guruji has come for a long time to conduct a campaign .
He says he wants to celebrate body donation as a fair.
I've always got many news and information through the phone.
Devesh, a resident of Delhi, has also sent me a message like this.
Devesh speaks from Delhi : Government efforts to take on the donor of body organs give me very pleasure of the principle plans that are related .
The country needs strong support in such a way that someone needs to help.
The countries like China are very advanced in the matter of body parts.
It is a matter of great importance that the target of donating a body part of ten lakhs of government has been appreciated .
In the country every year more than 2 . lakh kidneys , heart and liver organs are required .
But in a country of 125 crore people only 5000 body parts can be operated in our country.
Every year one lakh eyes need to be lightened.
But we can only give blindness to 25,000 people.
We can only give such a thing to four people in need of eyes .
If there's death in road accident, you can donate body parts.
I believe there are some of the legal complications in this matter.
State governments have also tried to provide guidelines regarding this.
Some states have shown good progress in efforts to thwart the administration practices related to this.
I'm supposed to be the first member of Tamil Nadu to donate the body.
Many social organisations, many governmental Sara Services, are administering the work of appreciation in this area.
NOTO has been established as National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation, National Cynthesis and Tessue Organisation.
The Helpline running 24 hours is also served by the number 1800 11770.
Our fronts are also frozen as Honey Tyakdena Bunjeeta
That is, the joy that he gets to enjoy is only by the words of Honey Tyakdena Bhunjeeta .
In the past Delhi's G.
B.
In Pand Hospital, the surgery was done by the wife of a rotten businessman.
After making special arrangements of this liver it was brought from Lucknow to Delhi .
This surgery was successful, saved a life.
We've seen it on TVs.
We need to give the food of body part donation , mahan donation , physician , physiotherapy .
We must give strength to this thing.
In my favorite folks, we are celebrating the sacred days of Navaratri and Vijaya Sami.
After a few days we are celebrating Deepavali festival too .
Eid, celebrated Ganesha Charity.
But in the center of this country is celebrating a big festival.
It's the kingdom's enjoyment and enjoyment for everyone.
From the 26th to 29th of the Akober month coming , the capital of India , New Delhi , is going to be the Indian African market .
This is the first time that such a big market is going on in the Indian soil.
The leaders of 54 African countries and the United Nations have been known to participate in this country.
It is believed to be one of the largest markets of African countries that run out of Africa .
The relationship between Indian African countries is very deep.
The population of the population of India is also the population of African countries .
If the population of our two countries is counted as one third of the world's population.
It is said that this is the only kingdom of India and Africa .
There are so many complications in our arms.
The jungles of Africa can also be seen in the wild animals of India .
There is a great deal in natural resources.
Only 27 lakh Indians live in African countries for many years .
There are contacts between India and African countries in economic , cultural , political , etc.
But in all these, India is very big in training the younger leaders of the African countries.
More than 25,000 African students have studied in India in human development , competence .
In many countries of Africa princes are also among the educational teachers of India .
Look, there's so close to us
Looking like that, this market is very important.
Normally when a market runs, leaders of many countries join together.
We're gonna try to combine the people of this country even though it's true that it's going on in this country.
This time the Government of India , especially the Human Development Board , has been organising a very important event .
Schools combined with CBSE are organized for competitors like writing poetry between all the students, enhancing their participants.
Only 1600 schools participated in this, including schools outside India.
Thousands of school students have written about information about Indian African relations .
On the other hand, Mahatma of Memories, Mahatma of Mahatma Gandhi's birthplace, has begun a museum on the head of Gandhiji's memories.
This is the 29th month of October in New Delhi through north states .
Many lakhs of school students found this miracle, the villagers saw, what was the participant of the Gandhis in the relationship between Africa and India, all the people knew about how people had suffered their influence on the mind.
In this competition many important participants were found .
A poem has my heart, it's my favorite, so I want to show it to you.
Look how smart the children living in small towns are .
We can see how big their gaze is, how deep they think.
Udra Kupta, a member of Muzaffarnagar, has written a poem in this competition, specially written.
Blue river in Africa , but the name of the sea , the Indians living in this island , the symbol of the joyous valley civilization of India , the Nile river and Karthaiz are the symbols of African culture .
Gandhiji started, everyone from Africa attracted the dwelling, kicked the door on his mind.
Johnnesbarko, Kingstono, Jimbapweyo, Sado, all the African countries, we get our potato shot.
Write me, there are fifteen tricks in the jungles, love of me.
The poem is too long, so I've read only some parts of you.
It's going to be the market between Indian African countries.
But it seems clear that there is a chance to connect the people here.
I'm demonstrating my appreciation to all the students participating in Epoti, more than 1600 schools, and the human estate ministry.
On the 15th day of the month of August 2014, Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, the official member of the village, was defined.
After that many member friends have completed this work.
They're busy with full mind in this.
Last month, in Bhopal, a conception was arranged.
In this way, the leaders of the villages, district rulers, some executive members, officers of the Central State Government, conducted deep connections with the village planning.
Through this different kinds of new ideas have been exposed, they are incredible.
I'd like to bring some things to your attention.
Jharkhand is one of the most tribal dwelling areas.
I'm sorry to remember when we talk about Jarkund, it's Mao militants, donkey cultures, bullshits, etc.
Several parts of this left wheel are ruined by the influence of militants.
But in that area, our senior executive member, Karya Munda, who is the subordinate secretary of the court, has dedicated his lives to the tribal people.
He chose to set up a village like Bursie village Panchaya, accumulated in the Kundi district of Jharkhand state.
If the area is hardened by the left shirt militants, where the government machine is unable to function, the doctors can't even join.
He started to go there, people gave confidence in the mind, tried to give life to government structures, and ordered the officers to come and join.
It was a drama that the area was roaming in the skull for a long time.
In addition to the conservation facilities in the village planning, the successful effort to make people aware of the minds, this Parcy village of Jharkhand state.
The precious civilians are supposed to demonstrate my life.
I've got a similar information from Andhra Pradesh.
Ashok kajapati Raju, a member of the state of Andhra Pradesh, was involved in the development of the village scheme.
He chose for the village planning of Dwaraburi village Panchaya situated in Vijaynagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
Other arrangements are going on.
He's making a special renewable relationship with this.
He advised students studying in school there to do a job.
Because the new television in the villages is likely to be learned.
But the eldest heads of the village are unable to get rid of.
He asked the school students studying upper classes to keep their parents study in this class.
School is such a way that in the morning students and in the evening their parents are also taught.
These kids taught only 550 uneducated elder citizens.
They made liberations.
Look, without any budgets in society, without sweeping, without any special facilities, how big changes can only be made by the only psychological obligation.
This is the singing of the village of Dwaraburi and giving it to us.
Likewise, our precious member of the Mizoram state in the north-eastern region, CL Ruvala, chose Gwala Hillong village as a village planning.
There he performed a special work.
This village is also known for the production of black pepper and black pepper .
Ruvala started the Black Festival on 11th March in this village.
The people of all parts have participated in this.
The elders engaged in public life joined the government officials of that area.
There was an observation in front of the black massoole that would be selling too much.
For attempts to make villages a centre of economic activity, how to market the fertilizers of the villages, to create a self-sufficient village with the village plan, they are really entitled to appreciate.
My brothers and sisters, if they don't get the place of purifying the voices of the mind, how is it
From Mumbai, Savita Roy has sent a phone message.
During the Deepavali festival, we're cleaning our homes every year.
During this Deepavali, we have to keep this pure condition clean without just cleaning our homes, keeping our outer environment clean.
They're attracting our attention on the right thing.
I love a thing to remember you, in the people of the country.
Last year, after the Deepavali festival, our country, especially the publications, conducted a campaign.
After Deepavali, everybody was boiled, showed them all.
They said it's not true.
As a result, all the publications made a awareness operation, after Deepavali, there was a clean drive.
You're right to think of how much we try about sanitation before the plans, even after the plans, it must be continued.
We're gonna have to do this for every public event.
I'm demonstrating my appreciation to all the publications of India today.
On the 2nd day of October last year the campaign of Gandhiji 's birthday and sacred India ' had begun to participate in the program ' Safai Gree ' organized by India Today .
They gave Clean India awards.
I knew that many kinds of activity was found.
Some people keep changing their lives for this regulation.
The information related to how many places in our country have been kept very sacred has been published .
After seeing it, I've been demonstrating my heart's gracious appreciation for this work of the transmission of the India-based team.
E . . . . , E . . etc . , which comes out of Andhra Pradesh and Dhelangana state from the beginning of the pure India campaign , is encouraging the activities of the country .
Especially Ramoji Rao, despite his age, his enthusiasm is not less than a moment.
He's making cleanliness his own personal planet.
Through ETV, he is constantly encouraging pure works for the last decade, and his messages are the colors that have come in this regard, he only pays attention to the creative work.
He has joined 55 to 56,000 schools of Andhra and Thalungana in a pure India campaign .
For public reasons, railway stations, places of worship, hospitals, parks, and many places are going to conduct cleanliness.
These messages also gain stronger in the creation of a pure India.
ABP News channel launches a program called India.
In the past, the people have developed the idea of sacredness in the minds of the people about the level of awareness about cleanliness in the middle.
NDTV has arranged for the type of conduct of pure India.
The Thanic Jakaran's communication system has also come forward continuously.
EE teamed, Andia Tv has also begun the process of pure India.
There are many channels in our country, many messages.
Everyone took this operation even though I couldn't tell everyone's names due to timely defects.
That's why Savita Roy, they're recommending the suggestions you've given you all over the country today, it's moving forward.
He wrote a letter to me, our brother of Meghalaya, Shanmukhnath.
It's about Mavalanonong village.
For the past several years this village has been cleaning itself in a corner, every corner of the pure world comes in a hurry .
A few years ago, this village has been awarded as the most sacred village of Asia.
I am very happy to have this information that a village of Meghalaya , which is situated in the remote north-east region of our country , has been engaged for many years .
The citizens living there have become a natural one.
It has become the culture of the village itself .
Such possibilities make ourselves believe that our country is certainly clean.
It's the result of the efforts of the people of the country.
In the year 2019, when we celebrate the 150th year of Gandhian festival, we will get rid of our Bharat Mata from the sacredness of the people and the streets of 125 crore people.
I've been told by the people of the country, when I spoke to the bricks on the 15th of August, I was lost in the country.
We have to hear a lot of messages like those who are very deep, when they pursue small jobs, they have to lay down a lot of hardships for the hospital, the treasures of the middle class are supposed to pay from them, even if they don't get work, we'll get paid.
After seeing this, there was an idea in my mind.
What's the need for a comprehensive selection for small jobs
I don't ask you that there's a psychological world to know one's power in a few minutes.
I'd say that when I was strained from this idea, the small scale jobs should be taken, the method called a genius selection.
My little friends, the government has taken all the actions related to this, non-gazetted, non-recognized employees of the Central Government Department, C section and P sections.
It's coming to him on the 1st day of January in 2016.
We're not gonna interrupt any of the ongoing activities now.
But it will get amalgamation from one day to the month of January in 2016.
My niggers live for all my young social friends.
In the last budget we've made an important knowledge.
Our country is living in a way as a part of society.
Gold is considered a publicity for economic protection.
When the confluence comes, he gives his hand.
It's a tradition that has been in social life for centuries.
My opinion is that nobody can afford the country of gold.
But rubbing the gold in an unfavourable way is not good at this time.
Gold can be fulfilled in a compound.
Gold is the ability to change the economic power.
Gold can change the economy of the country.
Every Indian has to give your share in this way.
In the budget the promises made to us during this Deepavali festival, the people who come before it take specially to stay on the day of Dhanteras.
Before this, we're giving the form of action for this important plan.
We're bringing the plan to pay good monitization scheme gold.
According to this, you pay your gold to the bank, how you get your pre-registrated population, and you can get the blanket for the shelter deposited in the bank.
They've kept gold in the lakers all the time before.
We have to pay Laker's rent.
Staying in the bank now, but you'll pay the money by slapping the bank.
Now tell the people of the country, don't you swallow the money
Would you change the power of the gold poured in unnecessarily
Do you want us to do this job yourself
If you put me a handful of money.
Don't keep sleeping at home.
Don't misunderstand its advantage, its safety, the two advantages of rounding.
Second thing.
Your hands don't get dressed in by the Savaran Golden Play.
Only get a paper.
But the value of that paper will be the value of gold.
That you're paying back that paper, you'll be paid according to that gold price.
Today, if you buy a golden gift of thousands of rupees, you'll get 2500 rupees instead of that paper, if you repay it for five years, then you'll get 2500 rupees.
We're starting this too.
That's why we don't have to buy gold, we don't have to protect gold, don't buy the paper anybody.
I'm sure the people of this country will have the next week's security plan.
We're describing the gold coin.
The golden coin of the Ashok Chakra.
We've been free for 70 years.
But we're using the golden coins of the country so far, or we're using foreign slums.
Why don't we have a promising code for our country
Therefore, in the coming week, 5 grams, 10 grams of Ashok Chakra, Indian gold coins will be displayed before the holy day of Danters.
Besides this, 20 grams of gold will also be given to the people.
This new plan will make a new change on the economic development path, in which I must believe that your entire complacency has come to me.
I'm the people of the country, on the 31st of October, the iron man's birthday is his birthday.
The only India, the Boat that has been convinced of your own India, will reflect the whole of India in mind when you think about them.
This great man is the biggest participant of India for the unity of India.
He's working according to his name as iron man.
Sir, they're gonna need us to get our working pancreats.
His dream of geographical India, even if he's right, should seize India alone, that mantra must consistently be formed through our thoughts, practices, exhibitions.
India's rich country.
Our country is full of sophisticated hindrances, many methods, many languages, many species, many environments.
These variations make us beautiful.
If these precious things aren't merely, whatever beauty has come to us, it'll not go to us.
That's why, the only mantra of separation.
Peace, compassion, compassion, etc. are the roots of development.
Over the past several years, on the 31st day of October, there has been a continuous drive.
I'm supposed to be part of it before the pilgrimage.
I have also been told that this process is being organized in different parts and people are engaged in drilling unity with enthusiasm.
The drive is actually the drive towards growth.
In another way, if you want to say it, the rationality of growth is the same drive.
Come on, Sardar will indicate them our workforce.
Let's go ahead with the mantra.
My brothers and sisters, you all are engaged in the production of Deepavali.
The purity of the house continues to be pursued , buying new things , the sacred Deepavali is celebrated in various parts of the country .
Before Deepawali's sacred fate, I'm supposed to demonstrate my unimaginable life to all of you.
But during the days of Deepavali take a straight color of danger .
Be careful, when you burst the cottons, when you put them on fire.
Give me the pleasure of the festival of Dipavali, but I'm sure that our children should see the colors of no harm to any children.
And we must have done purely.
My countrymen, the next day of Dipawali, I'm going to Britain.
This time my private folk journey is very comfortable.
It has an important reason.
A few weeks ago in Mumbai Baba Saheb Ambatkar had gone to a special place of memorial .
In London, Baba Saheb Ambetkar has lived in India now.
It's a place of pregnancy for 125 million people.
I'm going to get there to start it regularly.
This place can be pretended to be abandoned, abandoned, abandoned, abandoned tribes, an Indian man who comes to meet the places in his life, if all this house of Baba Saheb Ambethgar is determined, even beyond the confluences, to advance in his life, to get married.
At this place, Baba Saheb worked hard as Ambettler.
The Government of India , the State Governments also provide education educational population to the intellectual children studying in the wild countries of the affected areas of the society.
The Government of India also enjoys the wise children of the lower communities .
When we learn our children in Britain, this memorial of Baba Saheb Ambethgar, I believe that they're going to be a tourist spot, predictable.
If you learn to live, then live for the country - it's the news of yourself Baba Saheb Ambeatkar.
He didn't show up
My tour of Britain has made me a special excitement, this thing has not been confused for many years, now that house should be 125 crores of Indian people, it should be the memories of Baba Saheb Ambethagar, then look at how happy those like me.
I have another chance in London.
It is opening the idol of Lord Bhaswaeshwar.
Several years ago, Lord Passevaswar is a matter of enlightenment and encouraging works for the rights of women.
The idol of Lord Basavaeshwar in London is dedicated to the people of the world since many centuries ago how the thought plan of the great Indians was the best example of how many distances were visible .
When there's a possibility of this, the people of the country are filled with the minds of all.
My folks, man's guys, you're all together.
By phone, mygov.
I have colors that came to me through your suggestions.
Then, with your letters, programs are made in Al India Radio, discussions are carried out by the government officials, some try to solve them when writing about their problems.
We need to acquire many languages in India like India.
It's true that even though some languages were foolish, I couldn't even learn so many languages.
But Al India Radio is swinging every state language at 8 o'clock in the night.
The voice may be someone else in it, but the idea is my mind.
In your language, I must try at 8 o'clock in your mind.
Look how close our relationship is flowing.
Last time, it was over a decade.
Today we're following the new year.
I live in the people of the country once again.
Jean Hind
