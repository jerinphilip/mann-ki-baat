In the name of Manki Bath (Mandi's voice) Prime Minister Mr.
Narendra Modi today morning in the All India Radio (24.
9.
2017) The coincidence of the coincidence of the conversation, the folks, salvage all of you.
In Akashwani, three years have been completed by talking to you through the voice of the mind.
Today is 36th part.
In a way, the creative power of India, the feelings gained in all the corners of the country, desires, neglects etc. in some places are faults - even though people have given me a miraculous opportunity to communicate with the feelings of the mind .
You might have noticed that I never told you that it was the voice of my mind.
The voice of the mind was connected to the folk, they joined the feelings, their desires were linked to the Abilities.
I can only say at least in the cheeks of the mind, but I've got information in a humid manner.
Brightening, telephoneing, mygoving, narendramodiApping, all of which you send me information.
They're all predictable.
Several of them are about making reforms in government processes.
Sometimes personal disorders, sometimes social problems, etc. are attractive.
I take only half an hour of your month, but people are sending me information regarding the voice of the mind for 30 days.
As a result, the government's actions have been understood, the emphasis on the survival of the society.
It's a natural experience.
That's why this three-year-old journey of the Mental Church, the folk, they travel to feelings, experiences.
To get me a chance to understand the feelings of the ordinary dwellers of the country in such a short time, I'm thankful to the folk.
I've always come to remember the words of Acharya Vinopa Pawe in the cheek of the mind.
Acharya Vinopa Pave always says, "A-Sarkari, Azarkari" means the government's sarad, creative impact is full.
I have been trying to sound the voice of the mind by keeping the people of the country centered.
I'm watching the kingdom without studying in it.
Now I'm telling you that we're not going down in the land and environment, in the oxygen, trying to connect with you with a strong mind.
Of course, three years later, I believe social scientists, universities, research students, publicists will carry out the investigations about it.
Well, I'm sure you'll smell all the deficiencies.
These researches and observations will be more effective in the future thanks of the mind, in which there is hope of a new temper and a new awareness.
We should be careful about how much food we should eat, that we should not finish the food, I've already told you in the cheek of the mind.
After that, from everywhere in the country, there were letters that came to me, many social structures, many youths were all engaged in the drunken work.
I'm very pleased to enjoy my mind, enjoying my mind about how to use it.
Once the relaxed teacher of Maharashtra Chandrakant Kulkarni told him about his mind, he received a month from Rs 16,000 to Rs 5,000, then he was given a donation for the sacred work of 51 rupees.
After that, I noticed how many people came to join your share in this way for satisfaction.
Once I noticed that the Panchayat leader of the chicken took a copy with her daughter, I told her in the church of the mind.
It was seen that not only in India, but also in the world, it was the biggest campaign of Celphy with daughter.
It's not the problem of social publicity.
Every woman turned into a new self-confidence, new humiliation.
Every mother appeared to have to take sympathy with her daughter.
It's a feeling that every woman has her own importance.
In the last days we joined the tourism department of India .
I'm asking you to travel wherever you travel, where you send the smokes of India to surprise.
Lacs of pictures came from the corner of India , in a way it became a big deal of business in the tourism sector .
Look how the smallest thing becomes the biggest movement.
I felt it very well in the hole of the mind.
I told you, I was in my mind today.
Because, in the last three years, many events that took place last three years were round my mind.
The country has every penny to travel on the right path.
Every dweller in the country has to do something for the sake of health, for the benefit of the community, for the development of the nation.
This third year's act of anger in the mind, I've been learning from the nation, learning, learning.
It's the biggest source for any country, the greatest power.
I'm heartier to see the people of the country my deeds.
I once told you about the traitors in the church of the mind.
It's not just a clothing, guess.
Well, I can see that there's a lot of interest in the streets, I don't tell anyone to wear the traitors, but I'm telling you that wear many kinds of clothes, dresses.
It could be anywhere in the house, spreading, handcuffs, screening etc.
In the middle of the small communities, I can see the growing attraction on the trails.
Market sales have increased, due to which employment has increased in the areas of harvest.
On the 2nd of October , the first round of the trails is covered , it is covered with numerous amounts .
I'm asking you once again, we're gonna go ahead with the trails, make it stronger.
When we buy the traitors, we have to act in the mind the feeling that the Deepavali drives will be lightened in the harvest.
This process leads to the power of our country's evils, for which we have to do it.
Due to the increasing interest of the treasures, there has been a new kind of sensitivity and excitement in the affairs related to the traitors of the Indian kingdom.
It has been thought of how to introduce new technology, how to increase productivity, how to introduce the sun-power tools.
For 20-30 years it has begun to think of how the Buddhist sacrifice was given to the family of Falpa .
In Uttar Pradesh, the Shivapuri era of Varanasi has been closed for 26 years, which has now started working with the new temper.
Several types of actions are connected.
Many have a new chance to work.
The training center of the nested Kathi and Grothyouk , which is closed in the Pambore of Kashmir , is now opened again, and in this area there can be an adverse amount of divide.
Due to the re-opening of this training center, the new pupils have helped in modern production, inspiracy, creation of new products.
I enjoy that even if the big agencies give gifts to Deepawali, they will give me the supplies only.
People are starting to examine the traitors of someone.
We can realize how a thing is going forward in a natural way.
Our folk folks, we've done a promise that we're going to be in the hoof of the last month.
I mean, Gandhiji's birthday was 15 days before the 2nd day of October, and decided that we would be pursuing our country.
People will unite the minds through sacredness.
The President of our assessment started this work, the nation was united in it.
Everybody, male and female, city-village, is connecting you today, a part of this sacred movement.
We've been sure that this sacred drive is pursuing our success with the help of our conviction, we're spreading in front of our eyes.
Everyone's making it yourself famous, helping, giving it a share of slavery.
Even if I express my gratitude to the valuable kingdom head, all the people of the country who are associated with this operation will approve of my thanks.
Everyone is connecting you with this.
All of them are connecting with this operation as sports-rearers, students, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, workers, army personnel.
A kind of pressure has been felt that people are shouting at public levels, they should keep them clean even there.
I feel it's a good thing.
I am very happy to know that only 75 lakhs of people, more than 4,000 have participated in advance, some have been supplied to not leave, and continue to be successful.
Another thing about this time I was supposed to take care of another thing, that we weren't ruined from alarming.
At the same time, it is important to transform ourselves into a self-conscious movement.
This time many competitors related to sanitation were held.
More than 212 crores of children participated in the Authorities.
Thousands of children put paintings with their imagination.
Many wrote poems.
I appreciate the paintings that send our little children in social publicity, I'm proud of them.
If we talk about satisfaction, I don't forget to convey my thanks to the public sector.
They've moved this drive with a very sacred feeling.
They're supposed to be the biggest participant of their survivors, connecting yourself with them, creating artificial environment.
Today, they're gonna take charge of him in a great way.
We're gonna find out how big service is being done for the sanitation of our country's artificial communications, communications.
A few days ago, the 18-year-old Billa Dar, a young man affiliated to Srinagar, convinced me.
Sri Nagar municipality, Billa made Dhari a clean drive.
You can't think if the runners are involved in screening, or are involved in the field of sports.
Bildar has been engaged in purifying for the last 5-6 years since his 12-13 years.
The biggest lake of Asia is near Srinagar , in which they used to display plastics , polythenes , bottles , skulls etc .
From here, the revenues were also drawn.
When his father died due to cancer, he joined clean work with his lifetime.
It is estimated that they have removed more than 12,000 kilometres per day .
In order to administer the previous participant of sanctity, I'm demonstrating my appreciation to the Sri Nagar municipality.
Being a tourist spot of Sri Nagar , every resident of India has to go to Sri Nagar .
It's the biggest thing to gather sacredness in its surroundings.
It is admirable that they are supposed to drive the blade, and have been engaged in purifying him with vehicle, streams.
And it's not important that they go to other places and make public awareness about cleanliness, not relaxing until they get good results.
Billadar, younger, hygiene and emotional factors.
I'm supposed to appreciate Billal Dar.
We must confess that all the folks, from today's sides of history, the future is born.
If you talk about history, yourself is a very simple thing about the mentors.
This month of October our magnificent architects are mixed in the month of the memorial.
Started by Gandhians, till Sardar Boatel, in the month of October, the magicians spread our eyes ahead.
They showed us directions in the 20th and 21th century, headed, experienced many miseries for the country.
On the date of October 2, Gandhiji, Lord Bhadur Shastri's birthday, the birthday of 11 January of the month of October, the birthday of the Nanaji Teshmuk sector, the 25th day of the month of September, the birthday of Than Tyala Upadiya.
Nanaji, this year is centenary for the Than Dyalists.
Do you know what was the center of all these magicians
Living for the country, slaughtering the merchandise of the country, not standing with a few words, living in your life, was a common thing between them.
Gandhians like Jayaprakash Narayan, Dhina Diyal, who were away from the authority centers, lived with the lives of the people, who sacrificed their lives for them, for everybody's sake, were engaged in some work for happiness.
Nanaji Teshmuk, who triggered political life and joined himself with the garodayan campaign, in this way we celebrated his centenary, is important to guess his work on geography.
When the former President of India Sambambah speaks to the youth, Nanaji Teshmuk ever preferred the details of his rural development.
With respect, he also went to the villages to see these works of Nanaji.
Like Gandhians, Dhian Tayal Upadiya will talk about the man in the community's market.
Din Dayal remembers how he can make changes in the lives of social evils, harmful people, depressed, desperate supporters, education, workplace.
Looking at all these miracles, they don't have a gift to us, if we see why these miracles think, when you think, we're gonna rotate the way forward.
I must tell them about Sardar Brahbbai Boatel in the next mood, but in the country on the 31st of October, there are unparalleled India, unlimited India.
In every city of the country, there must be a large number of running programs, the wallet is also comfortable according to it.
Get iron like them, it's necessary.
Clard they united the country or not
We also have to take part in this drive for synergy, move ahead of the mantra.
We're saying very naturally that India's achievement is in different ways.
Even if we're proud of confrontation, didn't you try to feel this confrontation
To the people of the country, especially to the younger guy, I want to repeat again, that's what we're alive.
Look at the confrontation of our India, feel it, look at its glory.
For the evolution of the personality within you, you can see that this confusion of our country is going to be a schoolroom.
It's been a pleasure for the holidays, the time of Deepawali, to go anywhere in our country's shadow.
But it's obvious that we don't see our country, don't know about the contemporaryness of the country, want to go to foreign countries attracted by the day.
You can't go anywhere in the world, but you can see our homes around
I don't know what North India is in South India.
I don't know what's in East India, who lives in West.
Do you know how many confrontations are in our country
Gandhians, Lokmanya Dilkar, Swami Vivekananda, the talks of our former Presidential leader, Sampad Kalam Sarkar, telling you that a thing will be well known - when they visit India, see India and understand it, for that the new festival was born to accommodate your life.
These magnificents all visited India completely.
Before your operation, they tried to understand and understand India.
He tried to see India alive inside you.
Can't our various states, different societies, groups, their practices, their traditions, their rituals, their food habits, their beliefs, learn, understand, live, try to see
Don't stop walking and watching, we're just valuable to change as a student.
I have the chance to go to more than 500 districts in India .
There is a possibility of staying at night in more than 450 districts, the reason is that if this responsibility of India can be fulfilled, I can handle the experiences that I have done.
It's very convenient to understand things.
I'd like you to enjoy visiting this huge India
You shouldn't just stop furiously, it's our greatest energy, to experience it.
The dream of India's unparalleled India is in it.
How many types of food
If you have every kind of food every day all your life, you don't have to eat the same food again, that's the kind of.
It's the biggest strength of our tourism.
Without stopping from leaving the house in these holidays, without going for change, go out with the purpose of knowing and listening things.
Put India in you.
Connect the confrontation of the people of Kotanukodi into you.
These experiences will fulfil your life.
Your eyes will be expanded.
Say, who can be bigger than your experiences
Normally the time from October to March is of great tourism .
If you go this way too, you'll go ahead with this drive.
Wherever you go, take care of your experiences, avoid smoking.
Definitely send your smoke to increblendia.
If you have to meet the people there, send their smokes.
Record some things about the lifestyle of the people living there, not only does the natural forests catch the pictures of the bushes.
Turn good news about your journey.
In Mygov, send NarendramodiApp.
In order to encourage tourism in India, what will be the 7 most important tourist spots in your state - every Indian should know about those 7 places of your state, if possible, to go to that 7 places.
With the help of this, can you give any information about it
Can you express it in the NarendramodiApp
Can you indicate it in Incredible India
If a member of a state describes this, then seeing it, I would like to tell the prince to describe the advertisement papers about which 7 places are mentioned in general every state.
That is how can the tourist spots be taken forward in a way with the opinion of people .
Likewise, places you see in Nadeng, in which you have the most important 7 places, others need to see it, go here, get information about it, you can think about 7 places you like, you must send it to my Gov, NarendramodiApp.
The Government of India works on it.
Forming pictures related to such important places, creating video, making advertisement papers, supporting them - you choose things by the government.
Come on, combine with me.
During this period from October to March you can be psychologically encouraged by the tourism department of the country.
I'll call you.
Our folks touch my mind, as a man.
My mind creates generosity.
My mind has a deep impact.
I'm yourself a man like you
The event that took place in the past , maybe your attention had come to it - only the folks of women power and patriotism have seen the magnificent treasure .
The Indian monarchy has got two giants - Lieutenant liberty and financial, which are extraordinary giants.
Why are the uncommons who say they lost their inners in the service of Bharat Mata, the husbands of both honesty and financial.
When they fall into the world at this young age, you imagine how they feel
But the wife of Diagonal Connor Santosh Mahadik, Suwadhi Mahadik, competing with such a difficult situation, struck her mind.
He joined the Indian Army.
He joined the military for 11 months with hard work, and he engaged himself to wear his husband's dream.
Likewise, the Grandfather of Region Tubey, Mr. Mohammed Tube, came to the Kenney in the military, succumbed to his wife's financial work to join the military.
Every dweller doesn't suspect our mother's power to be respected by these monsters.
Our two sisters are supposed to demonstrate many lives of my heart.
They're making new exhibitions and new lives for the people of Kotanukodi in the country.
Our brothers live again for both of us.
My favorite folks, Navaratri Festival, between Dipawali, have a great opportunity for the younger community of our country.
FIFA.
The World Crown for 17-year-olds is going on here.
I'm supposed to be in front of the clutches on the four sides.
Interest on counterparts every time.
Everybody has to be involved in this game in the field of any school and galleries of India as well as not the youth who did not play clubs .
Come, if all the world countries are playing in Indian soil, we will make the game a part of our life.
My folks, the Navaratri is going on.
This is the point of worshiping Mother Durga.
The environment is full of sacred comfort.
A kind of spiritual environment in the surroundings, surroundings, devotional climate.
And all of them are considered to be the time for the achievement of power.
It's known as Sarta Navaratri.
It's the beginning of the Celebration.
In this sacred period of Navaratri, I have demonstrated many folk people, the desires of the life of the common dwellers of the country should be fulfilled, the country wants to capture new peaks.
The ability to compete every voice is to get rid of the nation.
In 2022, the country has to move forward in a rigid light, India has become 75 years of independence, the effort to fulfill the dreams of freedom fighters, the peace of 125 crore people, the restless work, the uneasiness and mind of the uneasiness, and the five years of plans for new India, we have to go ahead, our mother's richness give us our blessings.
Many lives for all of you.
Enter the pitch, spread the pitch.
Thank you very much.
