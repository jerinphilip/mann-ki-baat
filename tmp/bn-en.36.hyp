My dear countrymen, Namskar, the Bengal Translation of the 'Man Ki Vaat' (Supendash Festival) program of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, honored for the nation.
You're sure you're listening to me in the radio.
But the mind is on the test of the kids. Someone's tenth, somebody's twelve classes will start from 1st March.
That's what you think.
I want to be your partner in this regard too.
I'm worried about your children as much as you're concerned about.
But if we change our thought-conscious process about the test, we might be unconscious.
I've told you in my earlier "Man Ki Wat" that you must send me your advice through the Norendra Modi App.
I like teachers, all the students who have been successful in Korea, parents, social thinkers have written me a lot.
Both of these writers have touched me very much.
Secondly, there's a lot of things I think I'm very important.
We have limited the matter called 'immigration' in school slums, families and students.
From all the suggestions on my app, I think it's a funny thing.
There should be discussions about students all over the country.
I'd like to talk to my parents, testifies and teachers in this "Man Ki Vaat" program.
What I heard, what I read, I want to say something from what I was told.
I'd like to join this with what I think.
I believe that this 25-30-minute speech will be very beneficial for all the students who give tests - this is my idea.
My favourite student friends, why don't I start the Opening of Man Walt today with the world's famous Opener
You must have the feeling that he worked for the supremacy of success in life.
I want to listen to you about the words of Bharat Ratna Shri Shachin Tendulkar, who is proud of the young sect of India, I'm saying that Shachin Tendulkar.
I know it's going to start the test in a few days.
Some of you are worried about this.
One message for me - From you, your parents, teachers, relatives, friends, everybody's hopes, wherever you go - everybody asks, how are you preparing for the test
How many percent of the numbers in the test
That's what I mean, you're gonna steady something for yourself.
Don't put pressure on someone else's hope.
You must work hard, but fix a reality and a goal for yourself and try to touch this goal.
When I played cricket, I had many hopes for people too.
In the last 24 years, there has been a lot of difficult moments, but there was a good moment, but human hopes were always there and it was growing.
As the time has passed, people's hopes have increased.
It was very important for me to extract a solution.
I thought I would hope for myself and set a target for myself.
And if I steadfast my goal and fulfill that goal, I must do something or something good for the country.
And I've always tried to fulfill this goal.
I always had a goal and that's why the goal was gradually fulfilled.
I'm gonna tell you that your thinking is very important.
It's possible to get a predictable fruit when it's a predictable thought.
You must have a predictable psychology.
And I believe, God must give you good results.
I'm greeting you for my exams.
Give the test and make good results by becoming stress-free.
Good luck
"Brothers, listen to what Tendulkarji said.
Don't worry about hope.
You have to make your future.
You're gonna steady yourself.
Stabilize targets according to free mind, open thinking.
I believe Shachinji's message will help you.
Why is this right-up competition with outside
Why isn't your own competition
Why would I ruin your time to contest with others
Why don't I contest with myself
Why don't I try to break my own records
You see, no one can interfere on your way forward.
And when you break your record, you don't have to be a masker to look good.
Friends, don't think of the test number game.
Wherever he reached, how far he reached, he wouldn't go to the Hessab-Nicesh.
Life should always be driven for a great purpose - one should take a dream - should be committed.
Whether we're driven on the right path, or whether we're moving properly, this test makes him a hesitation.
If the dream grows, the test itself becomes a joyous celebration.
Each experiment is one step to fulfill that great purpose.
Every success becomes the key to the door to fulfill that great purpose.
And that's why it's going to happen this year, what will happen in this test, not being confused of all this, it's a big goal.
If there's nothing left to fulfil the hope, you won't be desperate.
Prepare more and more hard work and stress.
Thousands of people wrote a lot of small words through my phone phone at my app.
Shrey Gupta said that the healthy mind remains in the healthy body.
Students, take care of your health with your studies so that you can properly examine.
I'm not gonna tell you just before the test, don't you, or run three or five kilometers - what's the original thing, especially what's your rojannamacha on the day of the test
Anyway, for 365 days, our rojannamacha should be friendly to our dreams and visions.
I agree with Mr. Prabhakar Reddy.
He specifically said to bed at the right time and asked for a review.
You should reach the test center with admit cards and other papers - Prabhakar Reddy said this.
Maybe I couldn't say this, because I'm a little sad about sleeping.
My friends complain that you sleep too short.
It's my error.
I'll try to fix it.
But I must agree about this.
Sleeping at the appointed time - deep sleep is as important as your other work of the day.
I'm lucky, even if I'm less sleepy, it's deep.
And that's why I don't have trouble.
But I'll tell you, keep your sleeping thing right.
Some people have a long conversation before sleeping.
Then how will you sleep when you think about it
And when I spoke of sleep, I don't think I'm talking about sleep for the test.
Don't misunderstand, I'm talking about sleeping to be technologically free to give good tests.
I'm not talking about being asleep.
It doesn't matter if you get fewer numbers and answer the question that Modiji told me to sleep, so I'm asleep.
Don't do that.
I believe you won't do this.
Life is very important to strengthen the foundations of success.
The strong foundation of life is made of sympathy.
And the obscure and disciplined, the morning works at noon, he thinks the work was done.
But it has plenty of strength, and there is tension every moment, if one or half of our body becomes slightly discomfortable, then you must see that it affects the whole body.
It's not all. He has an impact on our daily work.
That's why you don't think anything is small.
Look, don't make the habit of approaching what's fixed for you.
Do it properly, do it.
Friends, I've seen sometimes the test takers like two.
One, who reads what he learns, they reflect what's good.
Secondly, there are other test takers who don't know what questions will come, what kind of questions will come, what I can't solve.
The question papers will not be easy, so I've seen the testimony of this two.
Those who are worried about what questions will come, their results are also negative.
The self-confidence that takes is exactly successful.
If anybody can tell me better than me, he is the master of the kite-mother who has sprayed the world's big player, the champion of the game of the world, Vishwanathan Anand, has given his experience.
S, we learned from him the trick to finish the test.
First, I'm telling everyone good news for the test.
And then I'd like to talk about how to test and experience my experiment.
I think you're gonna have to face all the problems in the next life. That's the same problem.
You need a lot of rest, a good sleep at night, not empty stomach.
And the most important thing is to keep the mind calm.
There's a lot of tests with a mask game.
When you play, you don't know any rice of a fool, you don't know, you don't know what's going on.
If you stay calm, eat properly, sleep too much, then you'll see your brain will remember the right answer to the right question.
So calm down.
Never take much pressure on yourself - this is extremely important .
Don't be very highly hopeful - look at this as just a challenge - I can think what I've learned for the whole year, can I answer these questions
At the last moment, just take care of the most important things and look at the things you can't remember.
When you answer the test, some of the events between teachers and students can be remembered.
All these things will help me remember a lot of reading.
If you read a strong question again, you'll see it's very easy.
Then you can solve it easily while writing the answer.
So calm down, sleep well at night, don't be more self-reliant, but you're not negative.
I saw your exams are better than your fears on the test.
So, be self-confident and very happy for you.
"Bishwanathan's joy is really a very important thing.
You must have seen how calm, how slow it is when he participates in international competition.
His eyes don't turn around.
We heard that incident of Arjun's life - only his eyesight.
That's how I saw Vishvanathan Anand.
At the time of the game, he's fully focused on the aim - and that reveals the peace of his interior.
It's simple to talk about the peace of the world, but it's really hard to be in peace.
Then we have to try.
It should be done only to laugh.
You see, if you laugh on the day of the test, you can live joy, then peace will come to you.
You don't talk to friends - stay alone, you'll be mindful, reverse a lot of book papers to the last moment - you can't calm your mind.
That is why smile - smile with a lot of smile - friends - see that your mind will be calm .
I want to tell you a little bit - you imagine you're standing in front of a pond and seeing beautiful things below.
But if somebody suddenly jumps into the water and gets into the water, then what's the best things that were seen below
If the water is calm, then below the water... as deep as it is, every thing can be seen.
But if the water is not calm, nothing can be seen.
You have accumulated a year-long hard work.
This treasure can't be found if you're quiet.
But if the mind remains calm, that treasure will come to you and the test will be easy.
I'm telling me one thing - I've ever heard a speech, or if there is a discussion on the government level - I don't know, then I have to be very conscientious.
When I tries to hear such things with extra attention, there's sometimes restlessness.
Then I think it would be better if I take some rest... so I made a way myself.
Deep breathing - Keep breathing deep.
Three times and five to breathe deep.
Sometimes 30, 40 or 50 seconds.
But my mind becomes calm that some things can be understood.
Maybe it's my experience, but it can help you too.
Rajat Agarwal said a good word: "He wrote my app, "I enjoy retirement with at least half-hour friends, family members every day."
Rajatji, it's a very important thing.
Why don't we see most of the time, we're gonna get the hessage, what's right and what's wrong
If the parents are educated at home, the parents are teachers, then write what I have written in the whole account.
Together, you're gonna find forty-five, no newbody. You're focused on the test that's done.
Calling friends, you want to know how they wrote.
You say: "I'm wrong - I did wrong - I knew it, but I didn't remember."
We're stuck in it.
Friends, you don't do that.
The time for the test has been done.
Talk to family members about other things.
Remember a smile of the day you left.
If you go out somewhere with your parents, remember that scene.
Leave yourself half-hour time without the exams.
Rajatji's words are really important.
Friends, I'll talk about your peace.
Today, before your exams, a person has given you some advice - who basically teaches teachers and today's kind of cultural education.
He is trying to reach the world in his opinion regarding the importance of 'Ramcharit Manas' in the present observation.
Religious priest, father, has given a lot of important advice to the students.
And since he's a teacher, Su-Chintak, I can see two points in his words: I'm the princessary father-I want students to say that they don't have any stress at the time of the test, understand, sit in the test.
And whatever the situation, accept it.
In my experience, we can be mentally happy and happy if we agree to the situation.
I'm sure it'll be successful if you sit in a happy test without any stress.
And if you don't get success, you don't feel sorry for failure.
And for success, it will be proud. I'm glad to mention a shawl. It's not possible.
Teach to live with failure.
.
Our honorable Prime Minister is the "Man What Walt" program. I'm grateful.
I've been very happy for everyone.
Thank you
We are grateful for the advice given to all of us.
Friends, I want to talk to you today.
I see, this time different people have told me about their experiences.
There must be discussions about yoga.
It's a pleasure for me that nowadays anywhere in the world, when anybody meets, they talk about some yoga exercises.
The attraction of yoga in the mind of any Indian person or any person in the world has come up - in this regard I like it very much .
My mobile app, Mr. Atanu Mandal, Mr. Kunal Gupta, Shri Sushant Kumar, Shri K.G. Anand, Mr. Abhijeet Kulkarni and many more people talk about meditation.
Emphasis on yoga.
But friends, if I say - I start yoga exercises from tomorrow morning, then it will be injustice to you.
But those who do yoga, don't do this today as they're testing.
If you do yoga, you must.
But it is true that yoga is an important role in student life or in the next life - mental development.
Easy ways - You must pay attention to it.
If you don't do yoga before the test, contact any person who knows about yoga.
Let's call you some yoga exercises that you can do in two to four minutes.
See if you can- I believe it.
My young friends, are you hurry to reach the test
Do you want to sit at your specified place
Why hurry for this
Build your whole day's timings in such a way that even if you're stuck in traffic jams, you can reach the timely test.
Otherwise, such a situation creates anxiety in the mind.
And one thing, in the question papers, it seems the time will be lost if they read.
But it's not okay.
You, read the instructions very carefully.
Two minutes-three minutes and five minutes - but no problem, no regrets.
I've seen, sometimes you can't understand the question papers, but if you read the instructions properly, we can accord with ourselves and fix it.
Maybe you'll take five minutes, but I'll request you to follow it.
Yash Nagar wrote my app that when he reads the first question paper, he felt it was very difficult.
After reading the same question paper again with confidence, he thought he would not find any other question papers - he must answer the question paper.
So that's easy to understand the question paper.
He didn't know the first time he thought - after reading the second time, he realized that the question was rotated, but he knew it.
It's very important to understand questions.
If you don't understand, sometimes the question paper looks hard.
I want to give you the importance of Yash Nagar that you read the question paper twice or twice.
And try to admit yourself with him.
You see, the question will be easier to you before writing.
Today, it is interesting to me that our honored scientist, Bharat Ratna, C.N. Rao emphasized on patience - he gave his advice to all the test takers in a very little bit.
Come, listen to Rao Saheb's advice: I'm from Bangalore to CN Rao, I'm completely convinced of creating experiments, not even disturbing competition tests, try to make the best results.
That's what I call my youngsters.
Remember at the same time, we have a lot of opportunities in our country.
Do what you want to do in your life and don't scream - you're gonna succeed.
Don't forget that, you're a child in the world.
You have the right to stay here like trees and mountains.
Whatever you need, that's the power of jealousy, self-sacrifice.
With all these qualities, you will be successful in all tests and efforts.
I wish all your efforts.
God bless you
See, how a scientist speaks: I spend half an hour in words, he tells them in three minutes.
This is the power of science and the power of scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb, who encouraged the children of the country, the words of determination, satisfaction, practice, that is self-sufficiency, concentration and hard work.
Friends, please.
If you're engaged, you'll be afraid.
The bright future is waiting for you to do well.
My app is interesting Dobbs shared his test experience.
He said that at the time of the examination, there was an attempt to keep a predictable environment between his family and his families.
It's just as Shachinji says, a positive philosopher, a positive psychological situation, a positive power.
Sometimes there's something that's not only ours, but also encourages students.
Whatever a good example of life, the truth makes things very encouraging, gives strength, and gives a new way to the danger.
We all know about the electrical bull discoverer Thomas Alva Edison, we've read about him in our silvers.
But friends, you ever thought, how many years he gave it back to the discovery - how many failed - how much time it took - how much money was spent - how ruined
But today, that power - the light of the bull is illuminating human life - that's why the failing seeds of success are available.
Who doesn't know Srinivas Ramanujan
This Indian mathematician is one of the greatest intellectuals of the present times.
Do you know
There was no legal education in the mathematics, no special training.
But, he has an important contribution to mathematical analysis, number elements.
He's given a lot to the world despite being a terrible life.
The success that anybody can get at any time, a bright example of J.K. Rowling.
Harry Potter Serress is popular all over the world today.
But it wasn't the beginning.
He had to face the problem - how many failures.
Rauling himself said : During the Mushkil he used all the energy to work which he needed at that time .
The tests are now not only students, the whole family, the school, the teachers are involved in it.
But without the help of parents and teachers, the situation of the students is not favourable.
Teacher, parents, even senior students, create a team with everyone, and the test becomes easier to go ahead with the conscience.
Mr. Keshab Vaishnav, wrote my app, he complained, shouldn't give much pressure on the students to get more numbers.
Just encouraging to be ready.
We have to think they're unconscious.
Vijay Jindal wrote, don't stress your hopes on the children.
Get them brave as much as possible.
Help your self-confidence.
It's really true, I don't want to say much to my parents today.
Please don't press.
If he's talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Make a light taste environment.
Keep the predictable environment.
Look how much confidence will increase between your son or daughter.
You can understand this confidence.
Friends, I'm sure about one thing, especially my youngsters... our present lifestyle has changed much from our old generation.
Every moment new ideas, new technology, and new science are visible.
We're not just curious, we like to be connected to it.
We want to go ahead with science at the same pace.
Friends, I'm talking about this because, today's national science day.
Every year on February, on February, we celebrate as "Jeasonal Science Day".
In February 1928, Sir C.V. Raman announced his discovery 'Raman Effect'.
He got the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
That's why the day of February escapes in the form of 'Jeotype Science Day'.
He's a genius of science.
Scientific thinking, attraction to science creates a new idea and on the other hand, it is not possible to create new ideas by excluding science and technology.
Today, in the 'Terrorist Science Day', the country's reflective power will be valuable, knowledge-scientific, technology will help us develop.
This is why the basic point of ' Diaspora Science Day ' is ' in Make ' .
ndia Science and Technology Driven I
nnovations...
"I'll tell C.V. Ramon the salutation, and request all of you to increase the interest of science.
Friends, sometimes it's too late to get success.
And when success is achieved, the vision to see the world changes.
Perhaps you didn't remember a lot of news because you were busy for the test, but I wanted to remind the countrymen one thing - you probably heard, science has a very important discovery in the world.
The world's scientists have done something for generations.
He worked hard, and he succeeded almost a hundred years later.
Our scientists have marked gravitational waves or great waves in their capacity.
It's a far-reaching success in science.
It doesn't just prove the principles of the great scientist Einstein of the last century, it's a great discovery of psychology.
It's going to work all humanity and all over the world.
As an Indian citizen, we are happy that some of our special scientists were also involved in this research process.
I'm supposed to convince all those scientists.
In the future, our scientists will try to take this research forward.
India will also participate in international efforts.
My patriots, in the last day, we have taken a cautious decision.
For success in this study, Laser I.
Enterferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory in the "LI
The government has taken the industry to set up GO in India.
There are only two places in the world.
India is third.
With India being connected this study will get new energy - it will have new knowledge - from among respectful resources also India will become an active partner in this important scientific exploration process in human clinics.
I'm thanking all scientists again.
My dear patriots, I'm telling you a number, you're gonna hear me "Man What Walt" from tomorrow.
You're gonna hear your mother's speech.
Missed call is number 81908 81908, I repeat-819088908.
Friends, your tests are on.
I'll have to check tomorrow too.
125 million countrymen will take my test.
And you know, tomorrow budget.
29th February - This is Lip Year.
But yes, you must have seen me understand how healthy I am.
I'll be tested tomorrow, Parshu will start you.
If we're all successful, the whole country will succeed.
Friends, you're very happy
Free from the stress of success and failure, keep moving in the mind free.
Thank you very much
.
