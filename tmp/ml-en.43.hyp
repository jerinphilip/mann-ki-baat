Prime Minister Mr.
Narendramodi, 2015, 26 July, at 11 a.m., says my dear country's people, the mind of the special launch conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population.
You have my greetings.
This was the beginning of the rain.
It will help our farmers to generate the Kharif crop well.
There's another thing in my care.
In our country, there is a lot of food grains and oil pigeons.
The poor need food to eat.
We need oil to cook vegetables.
But this time the crops are very happy.
About 50 percent of the food grains, 33 percent increase in oil grams.
That's why I appreciate my peasant brother-in-law.
My dear folks, July 26 is recorded in the history of our country as a successful day in Kargil.
As much as the farmer has a relationship with the land, he has a relationship with the military and the country.
In the war in Cargo, each of our soldiers has driven a hundred enemies.
My hundreds of appreciations for the youngest heroes of the enemy, even in their own lives.
The war in Carg wasn't just a war on the territory.
Every village in India was involved in this war.
Every mother and sister of India participated in this war.
They're young boys or brothers who killed enemies in Kargil.
Many ladies, who didn't even finish the silk of Mangalya, joined the war.
And their ancestors attended the war that young men saw their own children.
Likewise, the priests who couldn't even walk their father's fingers were fond of this war.
As a result of all these tribes, India can speak to the world today.
That's why my hundreds of appreciations to our brave soldiers today's successful day in Carg.
In another case, July 26 is important.
We're My Gov on July 26, after months of this government in 2014.
'I'm starting.
Our decisions were to increase democracy, to ensure democracy in the development of the country.
I can say very proudly about 2 million people, 'My Gov.
I've seen it.
More than five and a half million people have already recorded their opinions.
But the most pleasant thing is that more than a thousand people have found time to concentrate on 'PM application', and appreciated it.
Keep in mind the advice of Akhilesh Vajpayee in Copper, why did the discrepancies not allow them to buy tickets deserved by the IRCTC website of the Railways
It'll be better if the discrepancies avoid the difficulties of getting tickets.
It looks very simple.
But the government or others did not pay attention to this matter or seriously thought about it.
But, Mr.
Akhilesh Vajpayi's suggestion has been enacted by the government to facilitate the discrepancies to facilitate tickets.
My gov, even when the 'Logo' prepares the 'Tag line' and the work is planned.
'A lot of actional instructions are available.
There seems to be more fresh air passing in the rules.
Gets a new coincidence.
My gov is about what I should be speaking on August 15.
Especially in the directions coming in.
Srimati in Chennai.
Suitra Ghavachary has sent a lot of instructions.
Please discuss matters like 'Betty Bachao, Beti Pathao', 'Clean Langa', 'Clean India'.
I've taken a decision based on this.
If you want anything I want to speak on the coming August 15.
'My gov.
I'm sure send it to you.
Let's send letters to the sky.
Let's burn directly to the Prime Minister's office.
I think it would be better to give my freedom to the day of commemoration on the basis of opinion and instructions from the people.
I believe you'll send good instructions.
I want to explain my vision in one thing.
I don't want anyone to give advice.
At the same time, the state governments, central governments, territorial estates, and their responsibility do not find ways to escape.
I noticed a car accident in Delhi two days ago.
Ten minutes after the accident, the sportsman was thrown in the way.
He didn't get any help.
In the same way, many people write more and more matters, and you talk about road safety matters and make common people aware.
Let's be the Hoskot Niwasi Akshay of Bangalore, be the pride of Mundubadri in Karnataka - people are too, I don't remember the names of all.
Everybody's interference is real.
If you pay attention to the situation, the heart will fall.
Every day every accident is happening in our country.
There's a death every four minutes in road accidents.
The most distressing thing is, one of the three deaths is young men between 15 and 25.
Every death takes the whole family.
Governments should do the right thing on this subject.
But my parents must learn from home the habit of conducting the rules and controls of road safety to their children running towel and forewellers.
Maybe, papa, get home quickly.
There are autorickshaws written in the back of the film.
I feel sorry when I read it.
So, I'll tell you, the government wants to take some new actions.
For road safety, new consciousness or road construction technology will be developed.
The government wants to reproduce the roadways security bill with full care of the new laws or the threatening forces.
In the nearby days, the idea of introducing the 'National Road Transport Policy' and the 'Road Safety Karma Yojana' is active.
Another project is in the opinion of the government - 'Cashless treatment'.
This means that no money is paid in the first 50 hours or no one pays, and how can those who fall in road accidents be provided without looking at such things
How can you provide relief
It gives importance to things like that.
To use the entire country, 1033 toll free numbers, ambulance facilities will be included in it.
But all these things are after accidents.
It's necessary to be cautious to avoid accidents.
Every life in danger is worthy, lovely.
So there's one thing to keep every worker in mind - 'Karmacharya Karmayogi'.
I've told you this.
Some events in the past have come to me.
I think it's good to talk to you about them.
Sometimes people are tired of working.
Years of work, pay and gains will be handled properly.
So we think we're working.
But in the last few days, I received some information about railway workers.
TT Vijay Biswall of Nagpur division is interested in painting.
Whatever the painting matter can happen.
But he made the railway his choice.
So, he worked on the railway and displayed various scenes related to the railways in his paintings.
He's happy with that, and he's enhanced his job.
It's a good example of how new life can be brought to your job.
We're here to understand how to connect with the artistry and interest of our own profession, Vijay Biswal.
The painting of Vijay Biswal will be obvious in the coming days.
Another thing I remember is a small group of government officials in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
The work they do is touched my mind.
I really like that job.
They started operating.
I guess what's happening when you hear it.
But they made a new way to the 'Swachh Bharat Yajna' and performed the whole district.
'Brother No.
That's an excellent brother can give his sister a gift to Raksha Bandhan a toilet.
Inspire all such brothers and make their sisters a toilet.
So the entire district and the mothers and sisters do not have to urinate in the open space.
This great operation is going on on the day of Raksha Bandh.
The Raksha Bandhan's meaning has changed here.
I appreciate the teams of all government officers in Harda district.
I heard a news recently.
Sometimes some little things make me happy.
I share something like that with you.
Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh is a small village of workers living.
The people of that village have begun and finished the construction of the toilet for the last few months.
Now in that village no one has to urinate in the open space.
This is what they did.
When the yajna finished, they celebrated it like a festival.
That village has benefited.
The small village of workers enjoyed the festival.
Today, social life is changing.
People's minds are changing.
In this situation how our citizens lead the country.
It's a good example for me.
I write Bhavesh Dheka from Gohati about the problems of north-eastern states and T.
V.
See you.
He writes.
It's a good thing.
But I'm glad to know that there was a special ministry for the north-eastern states.
Mr.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, that ministry was formed for the development of north-eastern states.
This ministry has taken several major decisions after our government came into existence.
Can the development of north-eastern states and we can sit in Delhi
In the states of Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim, a team of central government officials decided to go to North-Eastern states.
The team has met the local government officials and has decided to discuss the problems of ordinary people and discuss the matters of the central government to solve them.
The results of this endeavour will occur in the coming days.
The officials who go there always say that this beautiful area is worthwhile to develop so good people living.
With the determination of development, the officials coming to Delhi are easier to understand the problems of the north-eastern regions.
This effort to develop north-eastern regions from Delhi is important.
The policy I say is actually an attempt to east.
We'll enjoy the success of this mission.
It's a matter of pride for us.
During these days, India's PSC-28 dispersed the 5 planets of Duga.
India has distributed the most weighty idols for Duga.
Such news will come, it will go for minutes.
We don't care much.
But this is a great achievement.
Today, when we talk to the youngermost, ask who is in the future, perhaps there are hundred people who want me to be a scientist.
It's very curious that there is no significance of science.
In a way, science and technology are the source of development.
We have to dream to become a new generation scientist.
They have to be encouraged in research and research.
I want to recognize their talents.
This is our biggest requirement.
Recently, the Ministry of Human Resource Development of India has begun a plan on the national level.
Promote children, guide them, help them, focus on these developmental matters, our pre-President of India's IIT, NIT, Central Institute University, to work as a 'Menter'.
That's why Kalamji said.
A lot of things have been learned by our IAS officers.
They must always be in touch with children in school or college near two or four hours a week.
Their experiences are their strength.
It will benefit the new generation.
That's what I want to tell our IAS officials.
We have taken an effortful mission.
Electricity has to be available 24 hours in all our villages.
It's very difficult.
But it must be done.
We're about to start it.
Our villages will get 24 hours of electricity in the coming years.
The children of the village don't have trouble while studying on the exams.
If small and big industries are to be started in the villages, they need electricity.
If they want to charge the mobile today, they have to go to the next village.
The facilities available in the cities should also be available to the villages.
That's why Dinada's Deputy Gramjayoti program was started.
Such a big nation, millions of villages.
It's too far.
We have to get home.
But this shit is poor.
We will surely fill it up.
I'm sure it's done.
My heart told me to talk about every Indian in today's Manki Bati.
And August, September is our time of celebrations.
We have lots of festivals.
You all have my heart-long best wishes.
You must send orders for August 15.
Your ideas will benefit me very much.
Thank you so much.
