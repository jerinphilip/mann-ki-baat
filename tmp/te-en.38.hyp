"Man Ki Bath" (Speak in Mansu) is my favorite country's imagination of Narendra Modi's speech.
My name for your beauty.
It's my chivari 'Man Ki Bath' in 2015.
I'm gonna talk to Manki Bath in 2016.
First of all, Christmas is celebrated.
Now we're making arrangements for the new year's welcome.
The country full of wealth.
Festivals continue to be bought.
A festival is finished, Maro comes to celebrate.
In a way, Prati Festival also leaves a observation in mind about the festival that comes.
I'm feeling once.
Based on the festival, the only country of the economy is the Bharat Matra.
These festivals give an opportunity to make poor people financially working, compassionate ways.
The Christmas Festival of all the people of the country is telling the pursuits of the year 2016.
To bring so much happiness to your beloved year 2016, new excitement, new excitement, new compassion, ignore you to mount the new peaks.
The whole of the world wants to be free from the nakedness - it is urgent, geographical, nature evaporative - the compassionate, all the ends - the happiness of mankind, peaceful life.
What's the matter of enjoying Man so much
You know I fully use technology.
I'm also telling Boley's speech, things.
I'll see MyGo Poortal sometimes awake.
From Pune, Ganesh Vi Savels Warker confessed to me.
It's a tourist season, a large number of countries, foreign tourists, a lot of Christmas holidays, reminded the search for different countries.
The tourism sector is taking charyas for all the facilities.
Well, there were tourist gamblings, travellers, pilgrimages, pilgrimage sites, clean and clean things.
It'll grow up in the world as much as it's funny, but it'll grow.
I'm welcomed Ganesh's thinking.
I'm listening to your beauty.
It's the principle of God's goddess in Man's country.
All the guests are coming to the house clean, comfortably.
It's also a good thing to get rid of tourist spots, homes, places of travel.
It's a matter of enjoyment to call me news from different regions of the country.
From the other side, I'm gonna have to tell you the media friends.
Because they're telling me about news by finding a lot of small, small things, good things.
This spirit I've read a news in Paper.
It's also I want to share with you.
This news about the Malviya of an elderly worker Dileep Singh in Bhojpura village of Sihore district of Madhya Pradesh.
Common labourer supposed to be a messenger.
There's a news in the queen about an amazing, magnificent puzzle.
It looked like I'm supposed to share with you when I noticed it.
If you give the material to build any future in the village, the lady who has been building a dragon didn't take him freely, he published Dhilip Singh Malviya.
In the village of Bhojpura, without taking a coolie, this drive has been made 100 bucks now.
I'm telling Dhilip Singh Malviya the pursuits.
Let's hear a lot of unconstitutional news about the land of Man.
But there are millions of people in the country of Man.
There's a lot of people who're doing good in a good way.
This is the power of the human country, this is the hope of the human race.
That's the ability to make the man in front.
That's why, "Man Ki Bath" looks very sad, sir.
Many of the rest of the world is moving ahead of the surroundings.
The weighing lots of old bulls, putting foot in the feet, putting one foot on your own.
The country is also moving forward.
Great education , excellent skills , many new opportunities for the treatment of the citizens to provide baking facilities to the beaches , the geographical levels of trade trades , jealousy for new businesses , facilitatory businesses , bringing access to the survivors of the bank - to provide slight slumps under the Modra Path of the common families without crossing the banks .
Yoga Tarafuna is now known to be the weight of the nature that is humiliated by Yavtu.
When he's supposed to be an international yoga, when he's not seen the whole man of the world.
I thought it was Bharat.
This feeling, when will this feel
Man is seen when he's supposed to be a world form.
Opening Balkrishna's mouth, how will you forget the mud of the brahmand in his mouth for Jesus
Then she understood what that power was.
The beginning of Yoga Dinotsav was also the humor of the country.
The message of cleanliness is changing in Prati's house.
Military portions also grow.
Welcome an electric pillar in a village that means that there is really understanding of the dwellers who use the uninterrupted education.
If the dark opens are over, how excitement is, what does he know about how the excitement crosses the seas.
Centre, the power sectors of the state's property are still working.
But whenever you communicate a couple of days to provide electricity to the villages, Prati gets to the news of the electricity of one village every day.
The village shows how the light of the light of the electric light.
This church is not very elaborate in the same media.
But I believe that Midia doesn't reach such villages, I'm supposed to communicate to the country.
It's a big advantage, it's so pleasant, satisfied for the poets in this power procurement plan.
In a village life, changing the lives of the people, they are happy to know by the news - farmers, poor, young people, women and everybody.
I don't want to tell them what the Lord has done, not to tell them that no one is able to punish.
Don't fucking lose the hiccups in this matter, tell them these news to understand.
Congratulations for Hakk's literacy
Good things, funny things, things about the good things that normal human beings, should act like everyone else.
It's also a service work.
I also tried to do this from my side.
But how much I can do one of myself.
But I mean, I should do it too
The woman loaded the narendra Modhi app on her mobile phone and could touch her hands with me.
In this app I'm sharing small things.
Projectors tell me a lot of complications through this app, the thing I'm happy.
You also share this effort at your level, in your own way.
Tell me how I'm gonna do the weight of millions of old ladies without your courage
Come on, let's inspire them to the common man in the common man's language, to inspire them as they can.
My dear young man
I first expressed myself about Start up of India - Stand up India in connection with the red fort of August 15.
It started in all the departments of that terrain.
Bharth Start up royalty
In the minds of the kingdoms, the new stars of the new star-up corporations, unprecedented, different stars off for the youngsters
Leave tyari colors, but serve, business- new things, new methods, new thinking methods.
The new inventions of the world, didn't move forward without creativity.
Start of India - Stand of India brought a big chance to the young man.
My friends who are young have brought the full level of Caryacharne Pranciples to Start up India - Stand up India on 16th January.
How would it be, what's this conversation
Why
Let's take a procedure in front of you with that sequence.
In the country IIT, IIM, Central Universities, N.
I.
Tea - There are young people climbing, everybody's live connectivity discovers this work.
In the start up poison, the man was stuck in a chatter.
Digital proposal, I had a feeling that the pill for IT business is Start up rimit.
But that's not the way... ...the country's originals have to change the batty.
A poor man slaughters somewhere, he works physically.
But, if the youngsters have a business, a negotiator, like they're supposed to be a laboratory, I'm calling you a start up for the invention.
Let's ask the banks to help the youngsters.
I'm supposed to ask those young men to move ahead with patience.
Market is also available.
Metho supplies of the young men, not the tricks for some niggers, kids.
Think of that.
The original original youths in the weight of the country are abundant.
They have to come to the conclusion that the Start up of India - Stand up India shouldn't be limited to some numbers.
Increase the root of nature in the country.
I'm also asking for state princes.
That's how to take this guess.
On the 16th of January, I came to you without consultation, speaking about this particular thing.
Your suggestions are always welcome.
My dear young man
On the 12th anniversary, Swami Vivekananda is also celebrated.
My people who were inspired by Swami Vivekananda are hundreds of people in this country.
From 1995, on 12th January, Swami Vivekananda celebrated the national youth festival.
This festival begins in Raipur of Chhattisgarh Garh from 12th to 16th of January.
This program will be a hypothesis.
This time I came to know that the growth of 'Bharat Yuvata - Development, Efficiency, Samikyata'.
In all the states, more than 10 thousand young people from all over the country know me about the hazard of this product.
The 'Sukshma Bharata Desh' is encircling a surrounding view.
The scene of 'Yuva Bharath' is witnessing.
Looks like I'm supposed to be a visual, visual.
You can also inform me about this young man's life, please
I'm specially advising young friends.
You send me your instructions directly to the Narendra Modi app.
I think I'm gonna know your mind.
I'll give you permissions to the Lord as you imagine in your young lifetime.
I'll inform you.
Kabbitty sweetheart, I'm ready to give you information on the National Mody Aap.
A teacher under the vision of Dhilip Chauhan of Ahmadabad, Gujarat.
Accessible India's democracies were set up in his paperwork.
Phone calling me, he shared his feelings with me.
Sir, we've started the excitement of Axesble India in our board.
I'm a teacher with vision.
I'm talking about compassionately aiming to two thousand kids.
I'm supposed to talk about how a kind of wicked killer can be comfortable, generated.
The students came from a magnificent smell.
There's so much inspired, excitement in the children of compassionate people.
I think you've been sent to the Oxseas Bull India Password so important.
Dhilipji, my gratitude to you.
You're punching this field yourself.
All these things will understand you clearly.
You're facing many problems.
Sometimes, there comes a chance to meet such a person in the ceremony.
As soon as I get married, I'm sure I'm supposed to think of many kinds of things.
The mind's imagination is sweet, man's expression.
A lot of people are sympathetic.
Some people are from birth to vaccine.
It's a supposed to be supposed to be rocky about them.
But this language, there's always a mind about these words.
Many times don't mind - it's not a way to talk about them, it seems they don't have to use it.
It looks like Gaurvanga.
Several words have been embarrassed like this.
Handicapped once, or disabled says specially added person is heard so many times.
I know the most important thing about the legs too.
When the Bharath Prabhu started the 'Sugmaya Bharat' garden, I wanted to haze that work.
But in some districts in Tamil Nadu, especially in Chennai, I haven't been able to haze that day for that work.
But I'm supposed to think about it in my mind.
I got a guess then.
If God feels some kind of deficiency in the body, then he's supposed to squeeze a two-fold correspondence - it's a man's complication.
Call them the witch.
But when they're sympathetic, they know that Man seems to have a defect in his eyes, but the prince seems to have given him some power.
In that separation of a variety of power, Master Nimpadani, can't see that power with his eyes, but when they make a drink, seeing his ability, it feels like "He's so good to do this day".
Yeah, it's okay, it's okay.
But seeing the experience, it looks like something else's power.
In such a situation, there was a imagination in my mind.
Why don't you use the word "disorders" in place of the words of the people in the country of man.
They're the same, or the more components filled with their own divineness, if they're any persons.
Divya Shakti is full of a drink.
The simple man is sleeping in the body.
It's so nice to me.
My countryman
At the place of the funny fools, dragging it into the skull
I'm hoping to open this fucking thing.
Below that day's smooth bharath garden, bringing changes in aristocratic fundamental supremacy, and make sure to smooth and beauty to the best of the beloved.
Readrooms, hospitals, hospitals, buses, railway stations, ramples, parking, lifts are available, all the times in the brailley lips - so many of them need a creative mechanism to make smooth things - need technology , to be busy, to make arrangements - should be a pleasant, happy feeling.
Put this action forward.
Participation from the public is also available.
Everyone liked it.
You can also run into this garden like your hands.
My favorite countryman
Provinces are constantly coming.
You're gonna finish.
But things must always be alive, excited.
Verko, the separation of the legends, must be alive for every person in the country.
They're dead in the files, don't swallow the remains.
For the generals, for the poor.
The weight of the corners was a laboratory.
They're supposed to get the prayagons of the yojans, so easily how to reach these fruits.
I'll give subsidy to Gas Sylinder in Man's country.
I'll pay for crores of rupees on it.
But it doesn't count-- it doesn't mean or determine it to the people.
I don't care if I don't know or not.
The governor brought some changes in it.
John Dhan's empty opening - base card - with the help of this, the very big number of rupees reached the sub-division line directly through the streets of Badilly.
I'm telling you I've got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records, under the Badilly Teacher, the most surprising victim in the future.
This story is in the name of Pehl.
This effort has become so vulnerable.
Since Nawamber Chivari 15 crores of cooking gass servings have been obtained under the Pahal Pathak.
In the bank accounts of 15 crores, the donkey was straightforward.
There are no mediators, no recommendations.
Don't touch them anymore.
On one hand, the base card, on the other hand, the opening of the Jan Dhan Khata, the third state, the central government, the list of Kalasi literature, the folding of the account - this is buying like this.
The National Rural Legislature is absorbing in Hamithak village.
There are many complaints in the matter of this evil.
Somewhere now that dump is straightened, the fucking person is jammed in the account.
Students were complicated to gain hunting.
The complaints are coming.
This jam process started in that too.
Crazy is very elaborate.
Now about 40 thousand crores rupees are being transformed directly into websites through different metals.
I'm supposed to be supposed to be immortalized by Badili forty-fourths perfectly.
My favorite countryman
The 26th generation of birth anniversary is a magnificent celebration.
It's a clean combination this time to be the 125th jurisdiction of Mr. Robert Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Even in the parlment, there was a special discussion for two days on the test.
It's so good carcrama.
The leaders of all the parties discussed in the utmost way of recognising the recognition of the privileges, the sympathetic evidence.
Take it in front.
The Ganesh dynasty of nature, the supremacy of the dynasty, is there a research system
You drowned off the fucking place
The man's recognition has made a lot of harms.
It's supposed to be jerking about Hakks.
Fucking shit
That church is equally important.
It's also saying it's supposed to mess about illness, carelessness.
But, you don't have a big deal about carefulness.
When the elections are held, they come everywhere.
They're on the walls.
Hoardings are arranged.
It's gonna be supposed to take a shutdown.
I'm sure I'm supposed to be careful when I'm holding the ship.
But why do you enjoy the survivals even in the daily life
This time Babasaheb Ambedkar's jurisdiction will take place as a symptom of 26 students, in colleges, colleges, colleges, colleges, nurses, competitions on various issues, competitions, competitions, competitions, competitions, sympathies, discretions
If the weight of millions of older monkeys move forward with their imaginary feelings, then how terrible is the creation of the world
Let's start this process with Church.
I think you're in your language on the subject of Duty, Christianity, Vidhi 26 before Janaviri, then send me a business in Hindi or in English, if you can.
I want to know your opinion, thinking.
Send my portal.
I think I know what I think about the young man's career in my country.
A small instruction: When the birth anniversary of the 26th anniversary of the birth anniversary, the men, the daughters of the Buddha, the wraths of the Buddhists in the swings, clean the neighbourhood of those wounds
Janavari 26, the most surprising purity, the luxury
It doesn't mean I do the privilege.
Millions want to do that.
Whatever the illusions of the beloved will make the mind feel so emotionally, that nervousness remains so unconscious in the matter of keeping that wrath clean.
Suppose, we're gonna get rid of this wickedness in our country
Depending the beauty of the 26th of this janwari - in the village of the majesty worked as a decoration of the majesty's wrath of Gaurav, sweet, sweet and sweet.
It'll be jerked by the people.
Jump through the precaution.
My favorite countryman
Secondly, you have many pursuits for the year 2016.
Thank you.
