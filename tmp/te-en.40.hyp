Professor Narendra Modi Man Ki Bath is my favorite patriot.
My name for all of you.
'Man Ki Bath-Mansu's word' got me the beauty of your beauty again by work.
Today, the Bharat-Dakshinafrica Cricket Jette is on the 5th Wande Mach in Mumbai.
This film has been named Gandhi - Mandela Mohammedi.
Now this march is very funny.
Two teams random matches.
So the Priority of Chewry Mach has increased again.
I'm telling all the sportsmen my pursuits.
I'm telling you about the friends of the Akashwani Kannur Centre tomorrow.
Congratulations to them as soon as the work of "Man Ki Bath-Mansu" started, many people got involved in it.
Among them, the 12th student of Kerala was also attended by Tamban.
The center of Anantaram Kannur started a function by calling her.
That's why the spontaneous spontaneous-- Fidbyak was designed to know.
It was designed in the public's emotion.
He praised the Akashwani Kannur Centre of Chaitanya, a girl named Shraddha, 12th Taragati.
She's supposed to be pursued.
I also got inspiration from this attempt made by Kannur Akashwani.
In the same way in the above mentioned areas of the entire country, the country will have a new power to run the country with the cooperation of the people.
All the friends in the Kannur Akashwani Centre are describing their heartiest respects.
I'm telling you the salutations.
I have to tell you about Maro about Kerla this day.
Kerla - Kochi, the students of St. Mary of Chittor wrote a letter to me.
This lecture has many kinds of importance.
One thing is that all of these girls have put a picture of the mother's weird on the opposite.
He sent me a painting of the weighted mother in the shape of a heavy country.
I wonder why they took me a picture in the shape of the country weighed with the frontiers.
But I understand the words written by those who wanted to give them so important Symbolic messages.
These girls didn't make Prathana Mantri a pill to conscious.
They're also trying to make the public aware in the same area.
They're supposed to be Mishen.
On the occasion, they worked for the public to make the charitable.
They went to many places and performed the drama to spread evil in the public on the occasion.
They're gonna be a professional, instinctive.
These girls said in my writing that you're listening to your Man Ki Bath-Mansu, please pray on the activity.
Twenty-one of Maharashtra's natives, Sudkey Guruji, always keeps a garden.
It's called the origin to be supposed to be excited.
There are many messages coming to me on this phone.
Devesh from Delhi also sent me such a message.
Please try to make a way on it, and I'm happy to see it.
The country's embarrassment in this field.
Prosecute each other.
China's been behind the mind than the disappearance countries.
Million's determination is very excellent to take the privilege of donating each other.
This thing's very pretty fascinating tongue.
The country has more than two and a half lakh kidneys , heart , liver donations .
But twenty five crores of people in this country are being supplied to 5 thousand people.
Prati takes a look at the eyes of O Laksh.
We're going to reach 25 thousand a year.
All four eyes are supposed to be given at the same time.
You can donate the originals of the body if you forget the road cremation ground.
There's too much trouble.
I also tried to inform various states of the country.
Some states have made a good effort to speed up it up on papers.
It's in the woods before the original donation.
Several social institutions, many healthy service sectors are doing a very good job in this country.
The National Argon and Tessue Transplant Argnezen-Noto's establishment to promote the survival.
1800-114770 services are available for the Help Line supplied 24 hours.
Teen Techten said Bhanji Tha.
The enjoyment of sacrifice is in the magic of Ten Taktan Bhanji Tha.
I've seen all the bricks in TVs.
In the Gibi Pant Hospital in Delhi, the carriage changed her liver to her husband.
He brought that liver to Dili from Laxon to special arrangements.
That surgery was sufficient.
Oh saved life.
Enjoyment, honey techteen Bhanji tha to create a meditation with this feeling.
Absolute this thing without penetrating.
Lovely countrymen
Now the man is shy, the night, the devil's birthday.
For a few days, the festival of Deepavali will also be celebrated.
Eid also did.
Ganesh Chaturthi also said.
But soon the country's getting a big start, all the people of the country will get the Gorva Revenge
October 26th to 29th is the kingdom of India - African Foreign Sammeet in Delhi.
I'm supposed to be at such a bigger level at the bottom of the country.
It's been such a bigger level at the bottom of the country.
54 African countries, invite the cousins of the numerators.
The African countries are very big.
- African relations are very strong.
The great country Janabha is the same as the Janabha of the African countries.
If both of these are killed, the man will be the third janabha of the province.
Laksh says they lived under the same territory.
The Hindu Mahasamudra has been divided into two pieces.
The mind is very commendable.
Life enjoyment in Bharath, the joy of life in Africa is seen in many ways.
There are also very comparisons of nature.
Nearly 27 lakh people of the country of wealth have remained in these countries for a long time.
There are economic relations with African countries.
There are cultural relations.
There are royal relations.
But the greatest of African countries, the greatest, the most important role in providing education to the youth.
Manav's development, capacity building, more than 25 thousand African students are living in weight.
Many of the people who walked around here are now numerous in many countries in Africa.
I know it's in a strong relationship.
Looking at that point, this relationship is very important.
On the occasion of the occasion of the Mahasambhas, the main poets of different countries meet.
In the same way, the summit of the main nerves is going on.
We're tricking the jerks of the public.
This time, the weight of the Lord, especially the development of the Manavas, has done a good job of the Department of Ministers.

In all the schools advocating with them, the students who were studying were competing in the middle of the business.
The Kavita contested.
Their portion was devised as an activity grown.
About 16 hundred schools were involved in this.
Bharath . There are also scooters in it .
Thousands of students have been talking about African relations.
On the other hand, Aktoba arrives on 29th day from the headquarters of Memorial of Mahatma from Mahatma Gandhi's birth port .
This morning, the students of Lakshadweep were stolen.
I saw the villagers.
Africa - Mahatma Gandhi plays a great role in the relations of the wealth, knows how much the Mahatma Gandhi's personality is in these two parts, it has been known.
Recognition.
There's a lot of excellent races coming in this rachna competition.
O's gonna look at the rocks.
Thank you well for me.
I want to hear it to you.
Even the school kids in small countries
How big is their eyesight, they think deeper
Looks like this poet.
Garima Gupta, from Muzaffar Nagar of Uttar Pradesh, came a poem for these competitions.
It's cool.
That's what she came.
In Africa , the name of Sangram , the large island of Maha island , the residing islands of Sukhmayam in the valley of Sindh , Gandhiji started the greatest of African culture , and enjoyed all the johannes burg but the king stain , jimbabbe but or chad does not find in all African countries , but I love the thousands of African folk .
I just heard you something.
This word is on the Indo-Africa.
It's obvious for the man that the progeny's supposed to meet each other's necessity.
I'm serious, for all the boys who participated in it, more than 16 hundred, h.
Ar.
I appreciate the Department of Defense.
I've done a representation of the Aadarsh Gram Yojana on August 15.
Many parlment friends have made this puzzle.
It's so clever.
In the last month, there was an activity in Bhopal.
On the path of the supreme villages, the village elder, district collector, parlment sabhadu, central-state governors and beautiful people were depthed deeply on the occasion of the worship village.
New thoughts are blown up.
It's very funny.
I'm gonna remind you of some things.
- Oh, yeah, that's a good state.
Girijan area.
Unfortunately, it's all he hears when he comes to Jarkhand's delivery, bamboo, gunfire.
Several places have been destroyed by the provocation of Wammapaksh.
But Mr. Kariyamunda, who played the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker, also crossed his life for the Girijans.
In Jharkhand, Panchayati village of Kunti district has been selected to be developed as a deserted village.
Strong words, the Wampakshu state is also embarrassed to go to civilians.
The doctors didn't even go.
Going to yourself, coming back, sweetheart.
It's believed in the public.
Depended to live in the presidency.
The authorities encouraged the pursuit.
It's been a long time that the desire to do so much in the atmosphere.
In this Persian village, the attempt to bring awareness in the public along with the mathematics of the supremacy of the orthodoxy village.
Gaurav, the partners of the parlment are appreciating Mr. Kariyamundaji.
And the news from Andhra has been given to me.
Andhra-Lock Sabha member Ashoka Gajpathi king - himself was embraced in the Ayodhya Gram Yojana.
Andhra Pradesh - Dwarabunda village Panchayati of Vijaynagar district has been selected as a luxurious village.
The rest of the business is that much.
But a big creative piece of sweetness.
Scholars were handed over to the diamonds in the skulls.
Because the newborn students were in the villages.
But the old ones are immunity.
That's why some big boys now told their parents to be taught in classes every day.
Now those pupils are teaching the intellectuals at night for single day children's education.
Moreover, about 5 hundred 50 illiterate students say these kids are dead.
They've made the Akshayas.
Look, there's no budget in the conference.
Not sircular.
I don't care about anything.
But you're gonna get a big deal with the naked balloon.
Dwarabunda village can be seen from Panchayati.
And Morrow's dear Parlment, sir.
El.
Ruvala chose Lok Sabha from the North-Eastern state of Mizoram.
In the north-east, the Rwala Hiling village of Adarsh village has made a good job.
This village is very famous for plantation.
It's very famous for jaggery as well.
Mr. Ruvala started exciting jaggery on 11th March in this village.
All the wrangles are involved in it.
Old orders have also come.
Good jobs are also coming up on the rope.
That's why the girls also grew bad.
That's why he's also set up a demonstration.
How to make the village's economy grown center, how to empower the village products, which makes it understand.
Mr. Ruvala, who has been working to fulfil the village of self-sufficient with the village of Adarsha.
My favorite dealer Sodrimnalara
How's the point in this mind not to propagate about purity in action
This message was sent by a telephone called Savita Roy from Mumbai.
On the occasion of the festival of Deepawali, we will roam the house on the ground.
This time Deepavali doesn't clean the rocks of Man along with the house.
And Deepavali Tarawat also does not keep the neighbourhood clean.
She looked at the best thing.
This maybe I'm gonna remember you a thing.
My favorite countryman
The last surrounding Deepawali suggested that it was not a real practice by extensively displaying the areas that were burnt across the country.
All the processes have devised a propaganda activity like awakening in the beauty of this part.
As soon as it became Deepavali it started to cross the garden on the climate.
You said that the festival should be taken in the form of the original activity of the festival before the festival.
Do this in the Prati Praja Activity.
This day, I'm telling every kind of congratulations to all the media organizations in the country.
In the last week, on October 2, the Mahatma Gandhi's self-sufficient activity, I got the opportunity to participate in the event of the Newspaper of India on Friday.
That organization has provided the Puraskaras of 'Clean India'.
I'm sorry for those who swore in 'Won-Like-Won-Mishen' Taraha.
In the country of Man, he purified the princes of the country.
All of them came to light.
So magnificently, I appreciate the India TV group that worked.
Whenever the Swachhbharat campaigns, from Andhra Pradesh, ETV from the Bengal, the universal media organizations took a look at this work.
Especially Mr. Ramoji Rao doesn't take care of a young man to see the enthusiasm of a very big man in the middle.
It's a michine that takes the segregation of the pursuit work.
ETV is producing purification work from almost one level of survivor.
There are also many news on purity in the wicked tricks.
And they're giving a lot of importance to the genius, the genius on the clarity.
However, in the Andhra Pradesh and the state of the state of the state, about 55,56 thousand readings, 51 lakhs of children participated in this activity.
Transfers, railway stations, spiritual affairs, hospitals, parks have spread over purity in such places.
Now these reports will make the power of self-sufficient sympathy by this threshold activity.
The ABC News Channel, called Ye Bharat County, Meera, started an activity.
It's explained by this activity that the survival of the rainy season has come in.
Andy TV Channel Benega has done a very popular propaganda called Switch India.
Divek Jagaron - This organization also took the clean burden of the campaign.
The George Institute brought the 'Mission Clean India' to India's TV capture.
There are hundred channels in Man's country.
There are thousands of news tricks.
I can't say all the names because of not comfortable.
But all the media organizations have made publicity on purity.
So whoever Mr. Savitarai informs that all the people of the country are now taking this action back, thinking that it's true.
In Meghalaya, Mr. Governor Shri Shanmugandhan Garu expressed me very much.
This excitement propounded about Mavalyannong in Meghalaya.
From a lot of years this village has given rise to its priest.
They were completely involved in the purification of the nature of this village.
They're saying nothing else that Cleanest Village in Asia is the most clever village award to this village.
Being away from the country of mind, there was a pleasure to find out that in the beautiful north-eastern region of Meghalaya, all the villages have won the awards of the Palestinian territory.
The purity of the people in the village of akdi has become the surroundings of their lives.
It was a culture in those villages.
That's why the monkey's been supposed to believe in the beauty of the world that's a clean country.
It's possible only when the countrymen work.
In the year 2019, at the end of celebrating 150th birth of Mahatma Gandhi, 125 crores of people are said to be devoted to the weight of the heavenly mother from the odour.
I said my dear patriots are some things that have disappeared in connection with the red fort of August 15.
When the poor goes to small jobs, how many sorts he gets for the separators, he's gonna get dumps, he's gonna get dumps when he doesn't get the job.
We'll hear all these swords.
And there was a thought in my mind from it.
What's the interviolence of small jobs
I don't know how much a man's expert understands a person in one or two minutes of interview.
With these imaginations, these small television jobs have been sent to the private secretary of the Interviews.
My dear young friend
I want to say so seriously.
This direction finished all the actions of the Lord.
Now there's no room for Group-D, Group-C, Group-B-Nance Gegitated, not in the future.
It starts from 1 January 2016.
Now it's gonna be put in place of this process, but it starts only from 1 January 2016.
I'm telling all the young friends about this occasion.
And in the budget below I published a favourite story.
In the country of Man, gold has turned into a communicable life.
The gold is considered economically safe.
The tail that came to the end of the tragedy has been considered to be a golden ear.
It's the belief that's coming in peaceful life for centuries.
I don't mind if you smell the value of gold.
But it's not good to keep the gold alive in this age.
Don't change the gold.
The gold doesn't change the financial power.
The gold country doesn't have the economic wealth.
It requires the share of Prati Bharati.
Whatever promise we did in Budjet is that in this Deepavali festival, we are going to start the main compositions of Dhan Teras, especially before the day of the shopping of gold.
We've brought the method to change the gold nigger.
Under this you can deposit your gold in banks.
How will you come to the bank when you put your duck in the bank and you will also get a wedding on the goldsmith.
They were putting the gold in front of that.
That's gonna have to finish the bullshit.
Now put the gold in the bank.
Bankey's gonna sell you as a wedding.
Nation Prajalara.
Tell me now, can the gold be composed
Can't you
Does the bungaum change lifelong as a mortality
Can't you change
- You just have to do this one punch.
You should stand under me.
Now don't keep gold in the house.
It's safe.
Widdy comes on it.
Two advantages.
Get this advantage of yourself.
My word is Savarin's goald bond doesn't fall in your hands.
Only a paper drop comes.
But the value of gold is equal to that paper piece.
And the day when you turn that paper, how much gold costs that day, the ducks will return to you.
Now you're gonna take a golden gun for the value of thousand rupees.
If you don't go back to pay that bond, you'll get fifty rupees instead of that paper.
But we're starting it now.
This is because there's no need to buy gold now.
There's no need to drive the gold.
You don't have to climb the gold.
Nobody will come to steal the paper.
In the week of the delivery of this method of harmony to the protection, the country's public.
I'm very happy to say that gold coins are also taking.
The gold coins with the Ashoka chakra.
It's 70 swords, smoothly.
But now the man is using foreign gold coins.
Or the gold bullion kaddis are using these foreign countries.
Why don't the country's country's magnet
That's why in the coming week, Dhan comes to the general public before Teras.
Five grams, five grams of Asoka chakra, wearing a heavy gold coin.
Along with this, 20 grams of gold pills also come to the public.
I'm supposed to be your compassion for me to change this new story in the direction of Arthy Kabhinti.
My favorite country Prajalara
Actoba's 31st anniversary, Manish Sander Wal Bhai Patel's Day.
The heaviness of the great weight of Saddar, the whole country's honourable picture, just after remembering the valuable patel.
This great man has fallen so much for the greatest significance.
He showed something his ability to manipulate.
Saddar's sort of betrayal.
But what the heroines have to do is geographically showed it.
But all the same magic - for thinking, the end of envying, the consolidation of the disciplinary system.
There's a difference in India.
Many languages, religions, sects, many languages, different species, cultures.
It's like.
The country is full of many differentiations.
More distinct, it looks like Man.
If this shit isn't gonna happen.
I'm sorry to see something.
Bahusha's not gonna do that.
That's why differentiation is the same mission.
Peace, integrality, unity - this is the dictionary of development.
Many years ago, October 31, the work of 'Ronfur UNT' is going on in the country of Anno.
Run for unity - so much has the chance to share my part in it.
Even this time, the country's four worms so I heard Tayari's going.
Prosecutions have been encouraged to run alone.
The idea of the same day-- step for development.
Mauro's intellectually the development-- the one-sided homie.
Interestingly, there's a homie that's the only way to develop.
Come on.
Give respect to Sardar Saheb.
Take the same spell forward.
Dear Sodra - Sodrimnala
Now you're all in Deepavali arrangements.
The houses are cleaning.
You can't be buying new stuff.
The festival of Deepavali takes place in the form of one place in the country .
Maybe the cleaning of Deepawali is my salutation to your beauty.
But on the day of Deepavali, some prayers are listening.
Due to the burning of the towels - or the flames of fire are rolling due to the lamps.
It's so funny for the kids of the tower.
Prati Talli - I told the father that you should contact Deepavali.
But the family's kids are fucked up without any jerks.
Think about it as well as you.
So clean again.
Do it.
My country Prajala
I have to go to Britton on the second day of Deepavali Tarawat.
This time I was very satisfied on my trip to Britton.
It has a special cause.
A few weeks ago, in Mumbai, Babasaheb went to settle a great memorial of the Chaitanya land.
Now I'm in London, the house of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar settled.
The people of the old Corps have become the inspiration of the public.
I'm gonna start with it.
The couple, but strangled, but - the survivors who live in the back, fighting hardships, Babasaheb Ambedarkar, this fate of the Sankalp Shakti - can lead the hardships to life, inspire the future of education.
And in the same country Baba Saheb penanced Ambedkar.
The weight of the property and the state's relatives, the slaves of the Samaj, the widows of the back, give the widows to the widows to live in foreign countries.
Produces the weight of the oppressed young people.
My belief is that Babasaheb Ambethkar is the pilgrimage of this place when Britton goes to slaughter the children from Bharath.
The inspiration will be the land.
Learn a little in life.
But live the country of the Orthodox.
Babasaheb Ambedkar gave this message.
Mansara gave it.
So, on my journey to Britton, I'm supposed to be very excited.
A lot of fucking fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' shit--
Baba Saheb called Ambedkar how enjoys the public like me.
I also have a chance to get Merrow in London.
To invent Bhagwan Vishwaswara.
It's really a matter of studying the pages made for the Mahila responsibilities of Bhagwan Vishwaswara, who was before many.
The idol of Bhagwan Vishvesvara on the land of London is very excited to say how people think of the Bharatiya Maha - who thinks far and wide.
You know that when you're killed, you're very angry with the fate of the man of the country.
My favorite countryman
Manki Bath-Mansu talked to you.
By Telecom, My Gave.
Your instructions are also giving me through these.
Your writings are also going on in the sky skies.
These church works are going on with the governors.
Some of them are coming.
I'm trying to enjoy the samasyas.
Learn the languages of the country like Bharath.
The beauty of learning some languages came to me.
But there are these languages - you can learn everything at all
Not.
But, I am grateful to the sky.
This Manki Bath activity processes in the local language of Prati state for 8 hours at night.
That soul might have been mortal.
But things happen to me.
I'll try to reach you in your language for 8 hours at night.
So the mind made a good bond.
The last couple wanted to complete the year.
Now we're passing in a new year.
My dear dwellers are very sacred once again.
Jehind.
