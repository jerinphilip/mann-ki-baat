Talking to the mind, June 2015, my dear countrymen, greet you all
In the last mind, I had prayed to you people that if you go somewhere in the holidays, and if there is any memorable picture then I

Post you at India Hashtag.
When I said, I didn't think there would be such a strong consequence.
Millions of people posted photos, Twitter pay, Facebook pay, in Instagram.
I can say, see a scene more than one, how many diversitys India is filled with.
Architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, oceans.
Perhaps the Government of India would never have thought that people can do such a big job in terms of tourism, which you have done.
And somehow I also felt so much that I also re-tweeted him.
And I understand, perhaps those who did not have photographed the caves of Belum in Andhra Pradesh, many people of the country probably do not know that there is something like this in our country.
Orchha's photo in Madhya Pradesh, we always consider Rajasthan as a water crisis state, but it is very surprising when a man sends a photo of the waterlock of the manal from there.
That is, really a wonderful work has happened.
We will move this forward, continue.
The world will see, our countrymen will see, our new generation will see.
My dear countrymen, you have made me the Prime Minister, but the person within me sometimes loses himself away from all the posts and rituals.
June 21, International Yoga Day.
I could say that my mind was agitated in the same way, at the time I kept this topic in the UN.
Then it seemed as if brother would be a thing.
But the view of June 21, where the sun went, where the sun rays went, there was no such land in the world, where the sun was not welcomed by yoga.
We can say to the claim that the sun does not fall in the world of yoga practices.
The way Yoga was honored by the world, by laying the eyelids, the way the whole world picked up on its shoulder, who would not be proud of whom India would not be proud.
I too became enjoyable.
The mind was overwhelmed.
And when the people of France, for whom Sean River and Fiel Tower are very glorious, they liked that place to do yoga, gave the place of equality.
People in New York have done yoga on Times Sure.
If Australia is a matter of Sydney, then the picture of the Pera House comes in front of us.
The citizens of Australia have done yoga at the same time by placing yoga in equal to the exa House.
Whether it is North America, Silicon Valley, Milan's Chuomo Athedral, it is a matter of pride in itself.
And on June 21, when I saw UN's Secretary-General Shriman Ban Ki Moon doing yoga on UN Deadquarters, how much joy came to me.
In the same way, the UNPeace-Keeping Force also performed Yoga very well.
In India too, on Siachen, our youth were doing yoga on white ice sheet, then there were yoga programs all around the navy in the sea, wherever our navy ships were.
Delhi has registered its position in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Rajpath became Yogpath.
I am grateful to the heart of the country and the world, and I can say this was not a dangerous program of the program.
It seemed that a new curiosity from every corner of the world, a new joy, a new excitement, a new engagement.
A few days ago when I paid Twitter, a family from Vietnam tweeted a photo while singing a small child, it was so daring that photo, he was so popular all over the world.
Everyone, men and women, elderly, village-city, developed countries or developing countries, everyone got added.
Yoga became a reason for connecting the world in true sense.
I don't know, I.
ntelectual class , lite world will analysis the phenomenon.
But one thing I am feeling, and every Indian can feel proud that the world is very eager to know India.
An curiosity towards India has increased.
Here the values, the traditions here, the legacy here, the world wants to know.
We all have the responsibility to share this legacy without our legacy, we should share the world, introduce the world.
But we will be able to introduce this when we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we are so familiar that our things, what is new in it, feel like our family values, we do not know India's family values is very big for the world.
Why don't we make the world familiar with our family, family values
The world will be amazing.
I'm sure I'm wonderful.
There are many things that our ancestors have given us and the world has the right to do whatever is superior.
The success of International Yoga Day has come to a new responsibility with happiness and satisfaction.
It becomes our responsibility that we give the best yoga teacher to the world.
It becomes our responsibility to see all the traditions of yoga from the world on a platform.
I specialize the youth of the country
I urge TEProcessionals, make some plans for online Yoga Activity by meeting you all young people.
Introduce institutions related to yoga, know the yoga gurus, know about yoga.
If you want to learn yoga then you can learn, if you want yoga teacher then you will get it from where, you should prepare a datebase and I believe you can do it.
Come on, start somewhere, this will also become a new power.
I also see the events of the past few days and from the point of view.
Working government, running government. Once the goal is fixed, how can we bring results, we have seen it in the past.
And when there was disappointment around, we did not forget, one voice was heard from all around a year ago, nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens.
You can imagine AYUSH is a department in the government, never anyone pays attention to it.
If you come to the newspaper sometimes in 2-5 years, then come so much. In one corner, a small department, but he leaded Yoga Day.
And the small department organized such a big job in the world.
If the goal is in front, then how much small unit works, it is a sample.
In the past, the world saw how our people saved people from Yemen.
Within hours, how the people of India ran to help Nepal, when the working government had to open Janhanan accounts in the bank, all the people of the bank came to the ground and in a short time millions of millions of countrymen were connected to the bank.
On August 15, I appealed for toilets in schools on the Red Fort.
And I said that by 15th August we have to complete this work.
The work that could not be done in 60 years was a big courage to call in a year, there were about four and a half lakh toilets, but today I can say with satisfaction, it is still late on August 15, but it was not completed, but people completed the work of making toilets in very few schools.
Meaning that the government, people, government welfare, everyone wants to work for the country.
With selflessness, the public interest-surveillance, if we take the resolution, then the government also runs, the people of the government also run and welcomes them by spreading public-generation eyelids.
This is what I have experienced and this is what is true to pursue the country.
Last month we launched three public security schemes, I did from Calcutta.
There has been very positive results in such a short time.
There has been very little work in terms of public security in India, but due to these three schemes, we are putting a huge jump.
In such a short time, more than 10 crore people have joined somewhere in the schemes of these public security but we have to move forward.
There comes an idea in my mind.
I put this idea in front of you.
Rakshabandhan festival comes in the month of August.
Should we create a strong mass movement before the festival of all the countrymen Rakshabandhan and give benefits to the mothers and sisters of our country to the public safety scheme.
There is a sister cooking in our house or a utensil cleaner sister or a sister working in our farm or our family has its own flow.
Keeping in view the holy festival of Rakshabandhan, we can give gifts to our sisters for a lifetime of 12 rupees or 330 rupees.
On behalf of Rakshabandhan's brother, sister can be a very big gift.
Why do not we consider the festival of Rakshabandhan as a target and see how many sisters we can benefit from it.
Come together with me, we all try to fulfill this resolution.
When I talk about my mind, many people also send me suggestions.
This time, I should say something for the monsoon, such suggestions have been sent by many people.
Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harshvardhan ji of Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji, he said that for the monsoon you must tell some things about the mind.
He has sent good suggestions.
And anyway, this season is a great pleasant weather for the mind.
And the first rain, everyone, at any age, wishes to enjoy rain.
You may also enjoy hot pakods, bhajiye, cornea, as well as tea in the rain.
But as well as the way the sun's rays give life, the rain shields our lives.
Boon drops of water are very valued.
As a citizen, we have to make the nature of saving water as a society, drop drops of water.
The water of the village lives in the village, the water of the city remains in the city, it should be our resolve, efforts should be made to stop the water.
And rain water stops and if the earth goes back and there is recharge in the ground, then problems of the year are solved.
Rainwater Harvesting is not a new thing, it has been going on for centuries.
Check dams, watershed development, small ponds, fields and ponds, we should save drops of water.
I always tell people that if Mahatma Gandhi's birth place. If you go to Porbandar in Gujarat and if you go to Mahatma Gandhi's house, then there is a tank in the ground inside his house two hundred years old, in which rain water There was a direct arrangement to go there.
And if you go to see Mahatma Gandhi's birth place, then see, even after two hundred years, he is still working the same way.
And the water isn't even bad throughout the year.
Porbandar is on the coast of the sea, but sweet water was collected in the house by collecting rain water, at that time so much care was also done.
We can also do it.
And this mass movement should be formed, this arrangement should be village-village.
In the same way, how much greenery loves our eyes, how much green life we like, trees and plants, gardens make life green.
All of us should be in large quantities by the social organizations, by planting trees, planting trees in this rainy season.
And I give you a suggestion and I have a direct experience, a big successful experience.
This is exactly my rural technology.
When you plant the plant, put an old soil pot in the plant bugle and fill it with water.
If you fill water twice a month, you will also run.
The plant will move forward very fast, development will happen.
You can use and see the old soil clock will be found.
I keep telling the farmers, instead of fencing you on the edge of your farm, plant trees.
They will become your property.
It is true that rain likes too much, enjoys too.
But at the same time, the most disease occurs in the season of rain, doctors do not get enough time, so many professions come.
And we know that diseases spread very much in the rainy days.
Due to the increase in moisture in the environment, bacteria start flourishing and cleanliness becomes very important for this, will become very important.
The urge to drink pure water is necessary.
Most people drink water only by boiling at such times and also benefit from it.
It is true that the care we will do will be away from us.
Water should be required, rain should also be saved but disease should also be avoided.
Countrymen, right now we have launched three new schemes, especially for urban people.
There are about 500 small towns in our country.
Waste to wealth. From garbage and waste, property can be made, bricks can be made, electricity can be made.
We have to move forward that dirty water can be used again in the fields by purifying dirty water.
Under the Amrit (AMRT) scheme, we have taken a big campaign to make our cities alive.
In the same way, such a country should be able to equalize the world.
In the country, there should be such a smart city to equalize the world and on the other hand the poor person of the country should also have his own house to live.
And the house also has electricity, water, toilets, and the school is arranged to study closely.
In 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of independence, we want to give home to the countrymen.
Taking these three things, we have started a big plan.
I am confident that all these schemes will be used to make changes in urban life.
I myself am connected to you by social media, many new ideas are meeting me with you, and good information about the government continues to be available.
But sometimes a person sitting in a far-flung village, his one-sided talk also touches our heart.
You know, a "Beti Bachao-Beti Teacho" program is going on by the government.
But when the government's program makes a person, society, village, then how much increases its strength.
In the past, Sriman Sunil Jagalan ji, a Sarpanch of Bibipur village of Haryana, took him a very big fun initiative.
He was in his village with his courage, and an atmosphere became such that every father decided to remove selfie with his daughter and keep it in social media.
I liked this imagination, there is some reason behind it.
In Haryana, the number of girls is very low compared to the children.
There are about 100 districts in the country, in which this condition is worrisome.
Most in Haryana.
But Save the Sarpanch daughter of a small village in Haryana, give such a turn, then the mind is very happy, and a new hope is known.
So I express my happiness.
But I have also received inspiration from this incident and so I also urge you to post your daughter, along with Selie with Daughter, with your daughter.
Bachao Beti with her - Teach daughter, you will write a tagline that will give this idea and write the best line, it can be in any language.
English, Hindi, your mother tongue, any language.
The very inspiring tagline I will be your daughter and I will retweet yourself.
We can convert this thing into a mass movement in a way to save the daughter-daughter.
Whatever work was started by brother Sunil from Bibipur village of Haryana and we all move forward and I urge you that you must get a post.
You see, the dignity of daughters, the pride of daughters, the daughter save the campaign will give so much happiness.
And this stigma on us, that stigma will erase.
So take enjoyment of rain, very good wishes to all of you in this rain.
Make our country greenery.
International Yoga Day is not for one day, you continue the practice of yoga.
You see, you'll see the benefit.
And I tell my experience, move this thing forward.
Make part of your life, make it sure.
And that thing.

Post in Endia.
Many such things will be made in your city, poor people will also be made.
Those who have Skill will also make them, they can also send them.
We have to reach the world, to bring the features of India around.
And we have a simple medium, we'll definitely reach.
My dear countrymen, today just so much, I will meet next time for the next mind.
Sometimes some people think that I will declare the big plans of the government. No, I am working day and night.
Let me talk to you lightly, sour and sweet, just enjoy me in this.
Thank you very much.
