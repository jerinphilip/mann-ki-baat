In the All India Radio, the coincidence of the speech made by the Prime Minister through the voice program.
10.
I'm folks in 2016, I've lived with Dipawali for all of you.
Deepavali is celebrated at all places of India with joy and sympathy .
And for 365 days, in any corner of the country, a country that runs a plan is our country of India.
The life of the people of India from a distance is the second name of the festivals, it is also natural.
Till today, the tradition of the festivals in India has come to an end, the conventions that have come in time, we are telling the tiredness of the events that do not come in time.
We're accepting the changes that took place naturally in the events required for time, society, etc.
But in all these things we can see clearly, this complete journey of the Indian folk festivals, their spread, their deepness, their manufacture to the people are all connected to a basic mantra - that is to bring the unity to the community.
In the same way, man and his personality will be expanded, trying to spread his tight idea towards the masses of society, to make it through these plans.
But in them, however the weather is, however the weather should eat, how farming the fruits of the farmers, how to transform that fabric, what methods should be taken in the bodily erosion, all of our advances are mixed in pursuit, plans.
Today the whole world is a matter of environment.
Natural destruction is shining.
In the traditional tradition of India the nature of nature comes out and makes everyone compassionate to boys first.
Plants, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds show responsibility for all.
We're celebrating holidays on Sunday, but you're watching the people of the past sympathizers, laborers, mercenaries, they're supposed to communicate the holidays in the days of Purnami, Amavassa.
Any kind of changes in the sea water of the day of purnamic, the day of immortality proves that there is any kind of impact on nature.
It also affects human mind.
That is, our country has a tradition of celebrating holidays, fondness, science, etc.
Today, we celebrate Deepavali, as I said earlier, we are teaching every reading, giving knowledge.
We have a message that this Deepavali film will also be Damso Ma Jyotir Kamaya, from the dark to the light.
It doesn't mean only the darkness that occurs due to lack of light.
The darkness of blindness, the educator's darkness, the deep darkness, the social evils, and the darkness.
If we can get rid of this, then it is the purpose of spreading the light of Deepawali by the Dibhavali, the darkness of the society, the lack of unity.
One thing we all know, go to any corner of India, see that you're mixing the sacred movement of every family, without being the greatest sanctuary, or a deep treachery, during the Deepavali festival.
Every corner of the house is clean .
He's also cleaning his soil that Deepavali has arrived.
Deepawali is also a clean drive.
But not just standing in the house with sacredness, cleanliness, sacredness, sacredness in the entire village, we must spread our nature and wealth.
Deepavali didn't stop with the Indian territory.
Deepavali celebrates and celebrates in some form in all the countries of the world .
Many governments of the world, the executive members there, the rulers of those countries also participate in the development of Deepa.
The eastern corner, the eastern corner of the west, the eastern corner of the east or the eastern east, the African , the eastern and the eastern region of all the countries are snatched to the eyes.
You all know, the US Department of Defense has published the Deepa's head this time.
The Prime Minister of Canada, Deepavavatti, is spreading his picture by the dudware.
In London, the England Prime Minister had arranged for a welcome program in front of Deepavali, all the communities, in which he himself joined.
It can also be said that Deepavali is not the only city of Indo-England .
The Prime Minister of Singapore participated in a picture in Instagram worldwide .
Well, do you know what that picture is
The 16 women members of the Singapore administration wearing the Indian folk basket stand by the court, this picture is very popular.
All this is made up of Deepavali.
Deepavali is celebrated in all the streets and parts of Singapore .
During the Deepavali festival , during the festival of Dibawali , all the communities living in many cities of Australia were invited by the Australian Prime Minister to demonstrate the life of Deepavali .
Now, the New ealand Prime Minister left and agreed to join the Deepavali events in his country that he should go quickly.
The thing I want to say is that Deepavali doesn't shine, the world's everybody's great day of encouraging from dark to light.
We're enjoying the bats with good clothes, good dresses during Diwali.
Children, young people are also enjoying this.
But sometimes boys walk unaware.
Several bats gathered together, busy trying to make great smiles, threaten.
What things are in danger, they don't even come to terminate.
During the days of Deepavali, there are reports about accidents, accidents, deaths.
There is another problem also . In a crowd of doctors also enjoy Deepavali nullah with their families , there is a confluence and a confluence .
Especially in the parents and cops, I want to describe that when the kids boil, they should be elders with them.
Considering that no mistake should be made, you should look at the unconsciousness.
In our country Deepavali festival is celebrated for a long time.
It's not a day.
It's a long church to the luminous pavilion of Karthik Purnami, in a way it's a long church.
Together with this we enjoy celebrating the festival of Deepavali , the production of Sat Puja is also on the Musthibs .
In the eastern parts of India, the festival of Sath-Puja is one of the biggest festivals.
In some way this is the biggest festival , it is celebrated for 4 days , but there is an important thing for this which gives a big deep message to the community .
The Lord of the Sun, who gives us all, we'll get everything from him.
It's hard to look directly and right, hiding, and okay, to see the survival of the sun.
Sat-puja didn't supplicate the sun.
But it's yourself that we obey the sunrise.
During this sat-puja sunset is worshipped .
It has the largest social news.
Even if I say about Deepawali, speaking about Sath-Puja, it would tell you everybody's passionate lives.
And, especially the folks, tell my thanks to everyone, this is a good chance.
The possibilities that have been happening for the past few months are taking a form.
Our military troopers support your money for our peaceful lives.
Military warriors, security guards, I've been conscious of this sacrifice, sacrifice, hard work.
I want to share a thing from the world of these feelings - we will devote this Deepavali to the protector .
Sandesh2 Soldiers, that's why I've invited the folks to participate in a program called news to the warriors.
I'd like to convince the country's warriors that there is no one who doesn't care about the extraordinary publicity, the warriors and the security forces.
Whatever amount of external externals are located, it is a gift to every folk.
Your information has been strengthened in the form of their heartbeat and confidence and enrichment.
Schools, colleges, students, villages, commerce, businessmen, marketers, leaders, players, filmmakers, who are anybody, who don't describe the country's warriors, who don't send any messages to them.
Representatives have changed this Deep Festival as a day to thank the warriors.
I'm telling all the soldiers of the border guard, the Central Reserve Police, the Indian Tibetan police, the Asam Rifles, the army, the landlord, the trooper, the air force, the coastal police force.
Do you know what kind of hardships do they feel like our soldiers
- If we celebrate Dibawali, one is in the slope of Himalayas, one is protecting the factory, and one is receiving a cop in the airport.
Look at what kind of fucking shit you're doing
When we're in a mood, if you see them thinking about them, those memories also create a new energy.
A message also gives strength, the country has to do it.
I really appreciate my thanks to folks.
The artists of the art, the art of that art.
Some put pictures, collumns, cartoons.
The artists, the artists, used to be poetry.
Many made good nuisances.
When I see the narendra modi ap or when I see the feeling sea falling in my gov...
..
..
.
Through words, through Pena, through Dhorika, uncovered feelings of colors...
..
All this can be imagined by the imagination of how much the warriors of my country give.
These things are marked in the Hashtag called Sandesh2soldiers.
I want Mr. Aswini Kumar Souhan to read the poem he sent.
Aswini writes: "I'm celebrating the festival, joyful, smiling, I'm celebrating, enjoying, smiling, all these are you, telling me today.
Religiously, because of yourself, you're the lust of pleasure, I'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping in the peaks, watching the mountains and the gardens and standing before you.
The country's dweller, I live on you, lifetime.
The country's dweller, I live on you, lifetime.
A sister Shivani sends me information through the phone in the event of my folk, even in the birthplace, the soldiers are filled with warriors in the naked house.
Let's hear what the soldiers want to say, come on.
"He's the Chief Minister, I'm speaking Shiwani Mohn.
On this day of Deepa, you will get great gratitude to the brothers of our army through the Sandesh2 Soldiers operating.
My husband is a military officer, my father, Maman, was both military officers.
Our family is full of warriors, many officers in the border have received good news, military personnel are getting more nervous.
Military officers, their families, their wives, do a lot of sacrifices with the army personnel.
In a way, there's a very good news for the slaughtered military community.
Thank you, I'd like to tell you that Deepavali lives.
"My favorite folks, not only the military heroes, are seen in every order of life.
Natural seizure, law-constitution, sympathy with the enemies, sometimes the young people who travel on the wrong path will be brought back to our way, our servicemen are supported by national emotions every turn of life.
A chance was brought to me carefully - I want to keep it before you.
I would like to point out how things in the basement of victory form a very big power.
You may have heard that the Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the habit of spending toilet in the open open.
Initially Sikkim state has taken this position, now the Himachal has reached this position, Kerala has also taken this position on the 1st day of November .
But why's a success like this, I'm telling the reason.
Mr. a warrior in the Indian Tibetan border.
A man named Vicas Father.
- He belongs to the small village Badana of Sirmaur district of Himachal.
We went to his village for the holidays of the confrontation of this Indian Tibetan Border Force.
He's gone there when he gets drunk in the village.
Discussions related to construction of toilets were going on in the village panchayat.
I came to know that some families couldn't get busy due to money laundering.
No, it's not the idea that we should discover this art, we had the valorous Vicas attacker of our Indian Tibetan Border Warriors.
Look at the former patriotism, he's not only folks on enemies
He immediately took his Kasol Book and gave him a cashew of Rs . 57,000 to the head, if there are no 57 households, give him a thousand rupees to the family, build 57 toilets, remove the toilet from the habit of extinction in the open space.
The Vicas attacker has shown them.
57 families have given themselves 1000 rupees, a new power for cleaning.
Therefore Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the habit of excreting in the open open .
Like this, it's happened in Kerala, which I like to express my gratitude to young people.
In the remote, roadless forests of Kerala, on the day-to-day walk, one of the places to reach the village, a tribe of tribes, is difficult to reach here.
Nobody goes there.
There was talk of not spending in this village for the attention of engineers in the city nearby .
At the same time, the decisions of the National Students' Army, the folk health planners, the engineering students, have come to decide all together.
All the things that are necessary to build toilets like bricks, cement, these students went to the wilderness of their shoulders throughout the day.
They built toilets in the village through their work, these youngsters freed from the habit of extinction outside the small village located in the remote forest.
This is why Kerala remains a state of extinction in open air .
The state of Gujarat has also declared that more than 150 municipalities have been released from the habit of extinction in the open open .
10 districts have been declared free from this practice.
A joyful news has been received from Aryan also , Ariana is celebrating her birthday 1st November month .
In some more months, they have decided to get rid of the habit of excreting in the open open.
This work has been completed in 7 districts.
In all the states, very fast work is going on.
I'm just putting something here.
The citizens of all these states , who are divided into the darkness of the country , are demonstrating my personal deeds .
My folk folks, the princes have great plans.
Continuously the first plan, when the second plan comes to it, the first plan is to be sorted out.
But generally not paying attention to these things.
Old plans are going on, new plans are being implemented, the next future plans are expected to be followed.
In our country, there are burnt houses in which houses are electric, they don't need plenty.
But whoever is worried in the king, sweets are provided, burnt, electricity is also available, in this case the intermediaries get the chance to pay.
I'm determining my lives to the Aryan state to fight this problem.
They're determined to free Aryan from the treasure.
The families in which there are burning beds, which are electric in any family, have been patronized by the base number, have declared 7 or 8 districts to be freed from treasure.
I believe that when they look at the end of this work, the surrounding state will soon become a kingdom to get rid of breeding.
The look at how a big change will stop the market sale, the climate benefits, the consumption of our own climate, and the comfort of the people.
Yeah, there's no doubt that the coinless people are suffering.
My poor folks, Gandhians always come from our guidance.
Where to go to the country, how to travel, determines the status of his call in every matter.
Whenever you make any plan, after remembering the faces of the evils, the humiliated comrades, then think that if you are planning, you will be able to get any benefit, then you will say that you will end with the guarantee that they do not have any suffering.
It's time for us to pay attention to the exploits of the country.
They have to get rid of the spots, so we have to take action one after the other.
Whatever our old idea, society should be freed from the other side of male and female.
Now there are toilets for women and children in school.
It's a good idea to find our women's child's unfavourable status.
Tubectomy is being imposed on government level, but many lakhs of children may be removed from the vaccination of vaccination, they are absent from diseases.
Mission Indra Dhanush's vaccine is being run for children who have been released from vaccination, which gives the child the power to get rid of serious diseases .
It's a 21st century, but the condition that the village is surrounded by darkness cannot be sequenced, the village has come to see a successful development of a big drive involving electricity.
All these years after the country's liberation, the poor mother, finished food in the wake, how she's healthy when she smokes 400 cigarettes smoke in her body.
Five million families are trying to get rid of smoke.
We're riding on the success path.
Small businessmen, businessmen, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, balloon shopkeepers etc . are smuggled by the harvest businessman to buy bricks.
The Mutra Plan, Standup Plan, John's own plan, the successful operations that have begun to get rid of the treasure.
By the basis, directly paying money to the banks, the rights, the consumers get the money directly.
A good chance to get rid of the owners in the lives of matrimonials.
It's only a change and a mechanism that will make it stop, it's going to be a way out of trouble, that's how it's going.
Famous folks of my heart, on the 31st of October this country's Manifestation, who made his lives of India a religious mantra, and he was born on the third day of his life.
On the 31st day of October, on one side of the monastery, the Goddess Sardar, who lives on his birthday, on the other hand, his memory day of Mr. Gandhi.
We're finishing our hearts with memories about magnificents, that's how we do.
But a phone call from Punjab, pain from that, touched my heart, sir, sir, I'm speaking Jastif from Punjab.
Sir, the 31st month of October, Sardar Botell's birthday.
Cirthar Boatel, he's been confronted with his entire life, and he's also successful in this plane.
They're all united.
I don't know what to say about the misery of the country, Mr. Indira Gandhi made them slaughter every day.
After that, we know well what kind of communications have happened in the country.
I want to know your opinion about how to stop such unfortunate incidents .
My creatures and my folks, this pain is not just a man.
After Sanakhan, there is a charter, Sardar Brahb Point Boat on the synergy of conqueror.
Successful effort to bring free India under a treasure, supplicate that the majestics who carried out such a big fury.
Sardar Boatel, he tried to unite, because he was his first objective, he was impressed with anger, but he didn't wander from the plane.
But on the birthday of the same Sardar thousands of Sardars, families of thousands of Sardars, Mr. Indira Gandhi killed after her bed.
On the birthday of that Mother's birthday who spent all his life for unity, the sacrifice imposed on the sermons is on one side of history, and we suffer from pain.
But in the middle of these confluences, we have to go ahead with the Sacred Mantra of Conflict.
It's the biggest strength of the country in the separation.
Several languages, many slaves, many dresses, many types of food habits, the synthesis of India's strength, the importance of India.
There's a treasure for every guy.
Every government has the responsibility to preserve the sympathy, even to explore the sympathy of sympathy in every corner of our country.
We're also away from the specific ideas, the specific nature, and save ourselves.
Sardar has given us one of the richest wealth, which is responsible for ourselves to make your own India.
The main mantra of synonymousness is the strong sympathy of your India .
Sardar's journey to life started in the struggle of the farmers.
He's a farmer's fool.
They're the biggest fugitive to bring free hunting, to the farmers.
Sardar's participant was the master of making the freedom struggle strong in the village.
It's the result of his capacity, energy.
But Sardar didn't stand alone with conflicts, he was also honored to make a decision.
Today we're questioning the name of Amul.
Everything of Aamul is well known in India and abroad.
But some people have come to know that due to the vision of their telescope , the combination of milk producers was made .
In 1942, the district of Kheda was known as Kerra, in which he had gained this idea, his identification today is an example of how he lived for the welfare of the Miller and the Ambul Institute, the farmers.
I'm supposed to demonstrate them with my honour.
On the 31st October of the anniversary, wherever we are, Sardar will remember them, the surety of the universe.
My dwellings are celebrated with the fervor of light in this Deepavali range.
Guru Nanak Dev's sympathies are for human society, it is not only spoken to India but also for the entire human society, it is still guided.
Service, priority, Sarbhatta Falia, that's the beneficial of all, that's the news of you Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, compassion, goodness, etc. are the chief ministers.
The purpose of liberating society from necessity, impatience, misery, etc. was that of Guru Nanak Dev.
During the surveillance of giants, slaves, giants and giants among us, Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo and Pi Lollo as his guardians.
And we too, Guru Nanak Dev, they left us and traveled to the path of knowledge.
It gives a pregnancy to discard the teeth, creates a fight against obesity.
We have to move forward with the help of this mantra that everyone's comprehensive and progressively.
All of these can be the best Guide than Guru Nanak.
I'm supposed to see Guru Nanak Dev, carrying light joys, smelling sympathies.
My folks mixed with my life, once again, on the day of this Dipa celebrated with the name of the country's warriors, all of you have my familiar lives.
Your dreams, your determinations, all kinds of success.
Your life will be calm, I'm trying to see my life.
Thank you very much
.
