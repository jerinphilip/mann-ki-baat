It's the sympathetic significance of the famous story of the Prime Minister 'Man Ki Bath' program on 22 May 2016 in Akashwani.
Love my countrymen.
I got the chance to expose you in my mind another time.
I don't think "Man Ki Bath" is a religion.
I'm excited to talk to you today.
Through the program of mind everywhere in India it was really meant to join you all of the roots of the country .
I'm telling him the gratitude of the sky to spread this 'Man Ki Bath' (Speak of Manus) program successfully at 8 o'clock in the Akashwani local language.
My words are listening to them, then through their letters, by Telecom Calcutta, MyGoo.
By the website in, NARENDRAMODYAPP tells me.
You're saying a lot of things are helping me in driving the government.
In the matter of how active the government is in serving people, these speeches, I'm with you, how much promotion to the public welfare programmes.
It's very useful.
I'm hoping you're more active in seeing our democratic people acting with enthusiasm.
The summer is growing day by day.
We think it's a little bit resting.
But instead of that we're seeing the temperature rising.
In such a situation, the taste gardens have probably raised the dream of a week's delay.
Approximately the country was rotten in the effect of the dry sun.
The heat continues to rise.
Animals, birds, or humans.
Everyone's feeling anxiety.
These problems are becoming poisonous because of the accident of the tourism .
The wild shielder is ruined by swallowing the trees without absorption .
To say a way, human beings have put the voice of self-confidence by describing nature.
On 5th June, the Prapanch Parivaran will be celebrated.
On that day, there will be a discussion about the entire environment.
Watch the environment.
This time the United States agreed to revive the fragment of ero Tolerance for the Elligel Wildlife Tread for the promotion of the State of India.
It's gonna get stuck on this cattle.
But about the jungle animals of mankind, we're gonna have to roam about how to enhance our wild fragrance.
You've been watching for a while.
Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir rose in the Himalayan ranges of Kashmir.
The root cause of burning in the forests is dry leaves to be unconscious.
This is the great firepower.
That's why protecting the rocks, protecting the waters, turning into a religion of all kinds.
It's 11 states I've been in the most invisible phase.
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Bengal.
I'm talking to the main monsters.
It's a proposition to pursue the privilege, so I can negotiate a combination meeting with all the chief ministers of the states, but I didn't do that.
I had a meeting with Prati kingdom and spent about two and a half hours each state.
I'm sorry that every state said.
Whatever discussions the Centre of the Dominion has enforced the state's duties, every state doesn't mean more money than the matter.
Likewise, in the face of water, environment, obsession, against the suffering animals.
It was surprising to the Central Government officials to find out some states tried to take care of the affected people.
Looking at the beauty of all the countries - there's no party in the marble bird.
We're not supposed to think about finding permanent solutions, but we're not gonna have to follow the possible solution ways to meet the communications facing so many times.
If you say so, it also gave me a nice pattern.
I've ordered them to exercise the Niti Ayog in how to put out the excellent methods of all the states.
Some states, especially Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, have fully implemented technology.
I want to converge other states also through Niti Ayog in the future, the most successful efforts made by these states.
The Partnership of the people stands as a powerful reinstatement to accomplish such rituals.
Think of that thing complicated.
Accomplished technologies.
If the operation is done in determined terms then it can be achieved as much as possible to communicate the muscles.
Put every drop of water to protect the water.
I believe that the water is given by God.
When the mind goes to Alya, we'll be happy.
Something below that we'll suffer in our innermost.
We pray for God's forgiveness as soon as we roam it together.
Water is also honored by God.
If one drop of water is old, then you're sorry.
Please regret.
That's why it's all possible to harness the water, to use the water, to absorb the water.
By absorbing the method of microscope, it is necessary to carry out more crops with every drop of water by sewing crops only with water.
In many states, the farmers who grow up to the swellings of Seeth are deliberately observing the dragons of water, so many others are pursuing the duties.
These things really like a clean news.
When I was discussing with the 11 states, I noticed the congregation of successfully imagined the practice of cereals in some states.
As a result, the crop has increased.
The water wasn't ruined.
Church was also put on the workers.
These states say they put big marks.
Especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat
These three states have worked greatly in the binding system.
Prati surveillance random, that's why the hectares should take the land to the microwaters.
If this change is brought to all the states, it will be so profitable in the business.
Put the water.
The farmers of the Mankarshi are trying to use the water of Krishna, Godavari rivers by Mishen Bhagirath.
"Near-Pragati Mission" in Andhra Pradesh
Technical synthesis is also useful for harvesting groundwater.
The efforts to use the geological water completely.
The people of Maharashtra are sweating in the public agitation.
Thank you.
My admiration is that the 'Jalayukta Shibir Abhiyan' who slaughtered Maharashtra was not suffering from the future.
Chattisgarh has conquered Lock Suraj Jall Suraj Abhiyan.
The Madhya Pradesh says 'Balram Talaab Yojana'.
About 22 thousand ponds.
This isn't the simple count.
Everything's getting stuck on.
As well as 'Kapil Dhara Coop Yojana ' in Uttar Pradesh , 'Mukhi Mantri Jal Bachao Yojana '
To reincarnate the portions in Karnataka, the plans were named 'Kalian Yojana'.
Rajasthan, in Gujrath, the efforts to reconcile them into the goddesses of water in the country of the most old wells.
In Rajasthan the ' Mukhyamantra Jail ' has been established in Swavalamban Yojana .
Yeah, it's the forest area of Jharkhand... somewhere there's water rock.
It's a big deal with the name of Check Dam.
Exercise to stop the rotten water
In some states small dams were built on rivers in the direction of stopping 10 kms to 20 kms of water .
It's all a wonderful feeling.
I'm annoying people.
Come on, June, July, August, September, let's take a single drop of water in the entire month.
Watch the water on the climb.
How did the water stop.
.
Make arrangements about these.
The dreadful man grabbed the water for the rainy season.
Nature is supposed to be ruined.
But... if you're gonna make the water sharp.
If it's the same thing.
If you don't get water after finishing the rainy season
Then how
That's about water, shove a farmer.
It's a matter of palanquins, poor people, dumb people, girls, farmers, patrons, villagers.
It's the wooden time.
We need water.
Don't forget it, man.
This time, when the Deepavali affairs are roaming, you should enjoy the matter of how much water can be sustained, so much water can not be stopped.
Then there's nothing to enjoy the mind.
The power of water is so tired that you can swallow these waters on the face when you get tired.
Let's get fresh.
That's the power
Well, when I saw a big pond.
Leave.
When you see the endless magnitude-- that feeling is great.
Yeah
We'll get such an invaluable wealth through the Divine.
Don't kill that property by putting the bastard's bastard.
Don't enhance the water.
Please increase water.
I can't bring the used water back to use.
I'm asking you to push this thing.
Don't leave the next time.
I'm gonna change the jal Bachao Abhiyan to save that water for four months.
It's not privileges.
Not the spectators.
Damn it.
It's the pretty man.
In the past, the mediums of propaganda have been widely dealt with water shields.
Even in the matter of saving water, these methods want to be guided by the public, the original plants, want to be part of the matter that makes the man full of water trouble.
I'm welcomed that medium too.
Love my countrymen.
Get the man country to the modern world.
The country of the world needs to be executed.
Several bulls must reach all the roots of the country at the level of equality.
For that.
You have to change the old habits.
I'm supposed to talk about a thing.
If you're comforting me in that matter, I'm gonna get the development of the mind in that direction.
Everyone knows
Small time, too.
Sometimes there were no coins, there were no mouths.
BARTER SISTEM.
I mean, if you want vegetables, they're gonna give some rice instead.
If you want salt, the vegetables.
There's something else in exchange for a stuff.
That's Barter System.
Slowly the coins, the same came to the coins, the mouths came.
But the time changed.
I'm gonna drive to the fucking business.
Electronic technologies will take man dubbs, give time.
It doesn't have the fear of purses from the pocket.
There's no need to count.
There are automatical counts.
It's hard at the top.
But gradually become habitual.
This business will be easy.
We opened the bank of almost all the families of the country in the "Pradhan Minister Jan Dhan Yojana" which was published in this media.
On the other side, the base number was found.
Now in the weight of the country, Prati has a heavy hand in the mobile.
Joining 'Jan Dhan', 'Adhar' mariyu can move forward towards the Cashless Society.
With Jan Dhan Account.
Rupee's got to pay the card.
In the coming days, this carriage cradles the Maryu Debit in two ways.
This is a small instrument.
That's the one's called the point of cell.
Your base is Number, you don't pay any ducks at the end of the car.
Dubbles out of the pocket, don't count.
Don't go staring at the dumb.
The Centre has taken some chickens.
How do you fucking do that with a POS
How do you take the ducks
Daddy.
We'll change the second page 'Bank on Mobile'-Universal Payment Interface Banking Transactions-UPI's way.
Mobile phones will be easily accessible for monitoring.
It's a pleasant thing, NPCI Merriyu Banks use this platform as a way to start by mobile app.
If it's over, it's not gonna work to steal your car as well.
About 1 nationwide.
25 lakhs of baking correspondences are going to be felicitated for young people.
Once the bank is squeezing in the direction of your gutter coming forward.
It's also going to encourage the banking services.
If the man learns to use this business, he doesn't have a carncy emergency.
Don't stay in the mouth.
Dubbles don't exist.
It's the same thing to cross the business.
Sufficiently the paradise will take place.
The lava goddess stops the other way.
Thank you, you're gonna shut up.
That's why I'm asking the country's public to put it in mind.
Getting started once, slowly, easy to go ahead.
I guess I'm supposed to have a mobile in my hand 30 years ago.
Gradually it was hairy.
If you don't have a mobile now, you can't.
This naked uninterrupted communication can also be the same form.
But if it gets so quick, it'll be okay.
Dear Prajalara of my country.
I'll sit down on the head while Access.
I don't have the golden shit.
Don't get the rajat.
Or you think it's just like you can't fix yourself.
These games are in front of them.
But the man must carry a good airplane.
To encourage sportsmen who go to Rio Accients, to double their neighborhood, each of them are in the same way.
Some smile cartoons, sweethearts.
Who encouraged any game.
The country's public should set up the architects on these players.
That's the game.
There's a winner in it.
It's Outmy.
Come on the tables.
Not even once.
But there must be a strangle.
In this matter, a piece of sports minister Shree Sarband Sonowal was harassed by me.
It's gonna hang you up.
We're all in the hawk of the last week's election.
How are the lists of choices
Looks like it's going on.
Sarbanandji himself is contesting the chief minister's day in Assam's election.
But they're only the Minister of the Centre.
I felt very happy to know this thing.
They reached Patiyala without telling anyone before the election of Assam.
Nataji's Sushma's National Institute of Sports is known to everyone who is studying the games going to Angels in NIS.
They suddenly surprised the sportsmans around to reach the skirmish.
It's just a matter of roaming the shore of the game.
A minister has given some kind of beauty to the players to think about this kind of sportsman.
How's the food, huh
Their bodies are enjoying the beauty of nutrition.
Or.
You're the culprits.
Or.
I'm supposed to be punished.
Or.
The food was neglected.
One of the players went to the room and saw it.
The sportsmans have been eating.
The results of the election are coming.
Select new guidances as a specialist
But a friend of mine enjoyed me so much to think about the sports minister.
Likewise, you know the significance of the sports of the minds.
Promote the people in the game, encourage sportsmen.
It turns them very big.
The excitement will be doubled when the player knows that 125 crores of people are alive.
I'm talking about the FIFA Under-17 Worldcup.
I've got a lot of money from all the countries.
This spirit I saw that the atmosphere of football is roaming across the country.
A lot of people are taking the shit and setting up the jatts.
NARENDRAMODY MOBILE APP PLAYING THAT ME.
Many do not play games.
But thousands of crores of people are waiting for these games.
This thing gives me a lot of joy.
Everyone knows about the country's favor to cricket.
But even on football, it's a clean signal to this nice future.
Give the fascinating sportsman to the fascinating players who go to Rio Accients.
Prati don't drown her with the winners.
Sports sports can be recognised in the scope of the country.
I'm asking for the country's projects to enhance the excited atmosphere, promoting the people in the field of sports.
The last eight, nine days are coming from somewhere.
I don't talk about the lists of choices.
I'm talking about the students who wrote the tests at the length of the year.
Pull up, twelve tricks.
There's only one more tricky filths coming.
In this, the daughters of Man told me their memory.
A pleasant news.
I'm telling the sniffers in this parinamala.
It's enough to do in life, but I'm telling them again.
If you don't want to come, life doesn't stop right there.
Live with self-confidence, move ahead with self-confidence.
But a new rock came before me.
I never thought of this thing.
My mygov.
When I got an e-mail in the site, my vision went that way.
He put his commencement in front of me, the Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh.
Gaurav Patel said it was.
I am.
P.
89 in board inspections.
33 percent marks earned, excited to reach home.
I guess I'm supposed to be honored all around.
But everyone yeah
If there's four more changes, it's 90 percent
I thought I was surprised.
I mean, my family, my friends, my teacher.
Everyone is my 89.
33 percent marks aren't happy.
Beautiful is the same thing.
If there's four changes, it's 90 percent Kada.
I don't want to understand how to face such a situation.
This is the birthday in life.
I did the craft...
I'm supposed to die.
Something.
It looks a burden on my mind and he sent it.
Gaurav.
You said so carefully.
There's none of your apprehension to be seen in it.
It must have been millions of students like you.
Because.
The Watava Rana has changed like that.
Don't get rid of winning it. It's gonna make way to retreat, not to do anything.
The incomplete thing in Prati's case is that... if you're looking out, drive your mind to the joy...
Not.
89 won you.
33 percent Marcull was good if they were shining yourselves, your friends, yours.
We've been with you to get a little advanced first.
I'm fond of your beauty when your kids bring the observations to the house, put them in vasta.
Happily, make sure that's fine.
Promote them to achieve further development.
Otherwise, they brought hundreds of hundreds, okay.
Even the day it's good if you do anything else
There are limits to the subject of nature.
Don't forget it.
Mushuji Giriswami was also almost like this from Jodhpur.
That's what I mean.
My neighbors don't recognize the surroundings.
Something's gonna do something good.
Long ago, a poet was slaughtered.
I don't remember that freak.
But that poet didn't come... I painted my pain on the donkey of life.
When they saw that picture in the morning, they would throw it off the stairs, the blue colors of blue colors were so good that those lyrics would not be there and that it would be better if they were attached
I said I'd hope you'd put one eye on my painting.
I don't remember what he said right about this.
It's the poem written long ago.
But that's what it feels.
I don't want to understand the painting of that picture, but it's just a lot of people who're gonna tell the stairs.
Mussoogiriji.
Your appreciation is like Gaurav appreciation.
It's like students' paintings to the fortress.
The duty to fulfil the desires of the public is on you.
The same thing I want to do to you.
Don't lose your problem in such a situation.
Listen to these people.
But, just avoid your vision.
Please try to do it well for you.
But, if you don't enjoy looking at the filth, you'll never touch new creations.
I'm glad to find you, and I'm sorry to get back.
A little bit of silence in the won't be straightened to regain.
But it's gonna be back.
That's the same thing I want to kill you.
Recognise it, how many complicated you are.
Go deep.
There's a chance to get new ones from there.
But especially with those around you, with your friends, don't touch your kids just by placing your wishes.
A friend.
Whenever you don't get in life, that life stops from the skirmish.
In the observations, the child who does not get good marks, develops in the games, enjoys the provincial in music.
The painting shows shines, leads to business.
Bhagwan Prati is giving someone a miraculous call.
So, you recognize that power that's hidden in you.
Give it a little bit of bullshit.
You're empty to put the first floor.
It's always waiting for life.
You're listening about Santoor's architect.
Sometimes it used to be a pill in the music of learning in Kashmir valley.
But he used it to be Pandit Shivkumar.
Flit...
It's a great philosophy in the whole world.
Mary Shehnny
Sometimes in some places, the fort of the kings was poured on the walls.
But after Ustad Bismillah Khan put his hand on it, it was known to be an extraordinary measure, worldwide.
So, what's in you...
How's it.
Leave your food, give it back to the fucking balloon.
It's the same to cross the filit.
Lovely countrymen.
I'd like to see Kharchu once once to save his health in the poor families of the country.
Church is really very close to not being sick.
But the sickness is very much for it to be alright.
Don't wake up without being finished by my life, don't live a man like the man's family's economic condition...
To protect from diseases, the biggest weapon is clean.
Clean only the poor.
That's the second weapon, I'm supposed to say once.
It's called yoga.
June 21, International Yoga Day.
There's an attraction, a focus on the whole of the world.
Many also accepted it.
In this tradition filled with compassions, it gives the desired power to live comfortably.
The main thing to avoid treatment is that.
The person who uses yoga should be healthy.
Staying satisfactory, surviving mindlessness, encouraging concentration, finding funny- these are all possible for him.
Yog day on 21 June.
It's not a function.
That's what everyone has to know.
Everyone must make yoga a part of their life.
For 20, 25, 30 minutes in their daily routine.
I want to inspire June 21 to change my life like this.
Once upon a time, the social atmosphere becomes a cause for man's change in life.
That's what I wanna do.
June 21, you're here anywhere.
You have more than a month's time.
What is Yoga Silbus this time you went to the weight of the loyalty.
How to do any thoughts.
All these rumors are entirely wise.
Look at them.
Put your village down.
Put your place.
Put your fucking shit.
Put it in your car.
Get the hell out of the fucking fucking fucking shit
Start
Look, you'll be a partner on June 21.
I'm supposed to find a lot of progress in the offices of the skirmish.
That office's completely changed.
Can't you manage June 21 to make yoga a part of my life
Can't you spread yoga in a neighborhood
Let's go
Do it
This time I'm going to work in Chandigarh.
On June 21, Chandigarh was roaming the yogas with the dwellers.
That day you're gonna enjoy worldwide yogics along with beauty.
Don't go back in any situation.
That's my wish.
If the weight of the country is healthy, all of you are healthy.
Love my countrymen.
Manki Bath' (Manson's talk) will meet you quietly.
Long ago I gave you a mobile number.
I told you that you could hear the "Man Ki Bath" program by calling Miss D.
It's just a bit more comfortable now.
You're gonna be listening to the program "Man Ki Bath" by calling Miss D to the Fourth Namber.
That's Namber 1922.
If you climb, then in which language you can listen to the program of "Man Ki Bath" in that language.
Love my countrymen.
Your beauty's namaskara again.
Please don't forget what I said about water.
You finish memorizing them, kaddu
Oh, okay
Otherwise, thank you.
Name it
.
