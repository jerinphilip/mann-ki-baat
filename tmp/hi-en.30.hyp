Talking about the mind, August 2016, my dear countrymen, Namaskar, is the birth date of Hockey's magician Dhyan Chand ji on August 29.
This day is celebrated as "National Sports Day" throughout the country.
I pay homage to Dhyan Chand and on this occasion you all want to remind them of their contribution.
In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, he played an important role in getting Hockey Hockey's gold medal to India in limpic sports.
We all know the name of cricket lover Bradman.
He had said for Dhyan Chand Ji - We scores goals like runs. Dhyanchand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, an opposition player hockey killed Dhyan Chand ji's head.
At that time the match was just 10 minutes left to end.
And Dhyan Chand ji made three rounds in those 10 minutes and said that I gave the revenge of injury to the round.
My dear countrymen, however, whenever the time comes to "mind", there are many suggestions on MyGov or NarendramodiApp.
I am full of diversity, but I saw that this time mostly, everyone urged me to talk about Rio Limpic.
Such an attachment to the Rio Limpic of the general citizen, so much awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to say something on this, I am seeing it a very positive.
Outside cricket, there is so much love for India's citizens and sports, there is so much awareness and there are so many information.
Read this message for me, this also became one of the reasons for great inspiration in itself.
A Sriman Ajit Singh has written on NarendramodiApp "Please, this time, in the matter of "Mann", talk about daughters' education and their participation in sports, because they have honored the country by winning medal in Rio Limpic.
No Sriman Sachin writes that you request that mention the Indus, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in the matter of this time.
The medals we got, the daughters gave them.
Our daughters once again proved that they are not less than anyone in any way.
One of these daughters is from North India, then one is from South India, then someone is from East India, then someone is from any other corner of India.
It seems as if the daughters of all India have taken the initiative to illuminate the name of the country.
On MyGov, Shikhar Thakur has written that we could do better in the limpic.
He has written "Adaran Modi Sir, first congratulate for the two medals we won in Rio."
But I want to draw your attention to whether our performance was really good
And the answer is, no.
We need to set a long journey in sports.
Our parents still emphasize on studying and occupying academics.
In the society, the game is still considered to be waste of time.
We need to change this thinking.
Society needs motivation.
And no one can do this work well with you.
Similarly, Sriman Satyaprakash Mehra ji has written on NarendraModiApp : "In the matter of mind, there is a need to occupy the Etra-curricular Activities."
Especially taking children and youth sports.
In a way thousands of people have expressed this expression.
It can not be ruled out that we can not perform according to our hope.
In some things, it happened that those of our players who performed in India, performed in the games here, they could not even reach there, and only two medals were found in medal table.
But it is also true that even if you look at the medal even if you do not get medals, then for the first time in many subjects, players of India have shown a great feat.
Now, inside Shooting, our Abhinav Bindra ji lived in the fourth place and he missed the medal with a very little difference.
Deepa Karmakar also wondered in Gymnastic - he was in fourth place.
Due to a very little difference, medal missed.
But how can we forget one thing that she is the first Indian daughter to qualify for lympic and lympic inal.
Something similar happened with Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna's pair in tennis.
We performed well this time in the athletics.
After P.T. Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar qualify for track field infinals.
You will be happy to know, after 36 years, the women's hockey team reached Limpic.
For the first time in the last 36 years, Mens Cockey managed to reach out stage.
Our team is very strong and funny after that Argentina, who won the Gold, lost the same match in the entire tournament and who was defeating
There were players of India.
The coming time will definitely be good for us.
Vikas Krishna Yadav reached uarter-inal in Boing, but could not get Brone.
For examples like many players - Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhoknal, Atanu Das are many names, whose performances are good.
But my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But whatever we have done, we will continue to do the same, perhaps we will again be disappointed.
I've announced a committe.
The Government of India will go in depth of it.
Will study what practices are happening in the world
What we can do, make his roadmap.
2020, 2024, 2028 - With a far-reach thinking we have to plan.
I also urge the State Governments to create such committees and what can we do in the sports world, what can one of our states do, the state likes one game, two games
I also urge the Association associated with the sports world to storm brain with a fair expression.
And I also urge every citizen in India to send suggestions to NarendramodiApp, whoever is interested in it.
Write to the government, discuss Association and give your memorandum to the government.
State governments send their suggestions to discuss taxes.
But we fully prepare and I am confident that we must get the best position in the world of sports, a country with 60 million people, 65 percent of the youth population.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is "Educator Day".
I have spent a lot of time with the students on "Educator Day" for many years.
And used to spend like a student.
I also learned a lot from these small boys.
For me, September 5 was also the "Education Day" and for me, "Education Day" was also there.
But this time I have to go to G-20 Summit, so I got to mind that today, in the matter of "mind", I will express my feelings.
The number of teachers in life is as much as the teacher's place.
And we have seen such teachers that who are more concerned about themselves than themselves.
They spend their lives for their disciples, for their students.
These days, after the Rio Limpic, all around, Pullela Gopichand ji is discussed.
They are players, but what they have a good teacher - has presented an example.
I am seeing Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher besides a player today.
And on Teacher's Day, Pullela salutes Gopichand ji, his penance, his dedication to the game and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
The teacher's contribution in our lives is always felt.
September 5, the former President of India, Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, is the birthday and the country celebrates it as "Educator Day".
They reached any place in life, but they always tried to live themselves as a teacher.
And not only that, they always used to say, "Good teacher is the same, in which the student never dies."
Even after being the President's post, living as a teacher and as a teacher mind, keeping the inside student alive, this wonderful life was shown by Dr. Radhakrishnan.
I also sometimes think, so I remember so many stories of my teachers, because in our small village they used to be our zero.
But I can say today that one of my teachers - now they are 90 years old - even today their letter comes to me every month.
The letter written by hand comes.
The books he has read in a month, somewhere he comes, the quotations come.
He was fine in his glance, not what I did all the month.
Like they teach me in classroom even today.
They're still doing me a way incorrespondence course.
And even at the age of 90, his handwriting, I am surprised even today that he writes so beautiful letters in this condition and my own letters are very bad, because of this whenever I see someone's good letters, then my respect becomes too much in my mind.
Like my experiences, you will also experience.
Whatever your teachers have done in your life, if you tell the world, the attitude of looking towards the teacher will change, there will be a glory and increasing the pride of our teachers in society is our responsibility.
You're on the NarendramodiApp, photography with your teacher, there is an incident with your teacher, there is no motivation of your teacher, you must share.
Look, seeing the contribution of the teacher in the country with the eyes of the students, it is also very valuable in itself.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh festival is going to come in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a villain and we all want our country, our society, our family, every person, his life is uninterrupted.
But when Ganesh talks about the festival, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh festival - This is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Through the public Ganesh festival, he made this religious occasion a festival of national awakening.
Made a festival of social rituals.
And there is a big discussion of questions that touch society and life through public Ganesh festival.
The creation of programs is such that due to which the society gets new oz, new speed.
And at the same time he gave the mantra "Swaraj is our birth- this thing is in the center.
Azad's movement gets strength.
Even today, now not just Maharashtra, public Ganesh festivals have started in every corner of India.
All young people also make enough preparations to do this, enthusiasm is also very much.
And some people have still made a lot of effort to follow the sentiment that Lokmanya Tilak ji had kept.
They keep discussions on public subjects, essays compete, Rangoli compete.
In his tableau, he also highlights the issues that touch the society in a artistic way.
In a way a big campaign of public education runs through public Ganesh festival.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us "Swaraj is our birth-simple right."
But we are in Azad India.
Is the public Ganesh festival "Suraj is our right - now we proceed towards Suraj"
Suraj is our priority, can we not give a message to the public Ganesh festival about this mantra
Come on, I'll invite you.
It is true that the festival is the power of society.
Festival fills new life in the life of a person and society.
Without celebration, life is impossible.
But according to the demand of time, it has to be molded.
This time I have seen that many people have specially written Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja - on those things.
And they are worried about the environment.
No Sriman Shankar Narayan has done Pacific, he has said with great insistence that Modi ji, you should explain to the people in the matter of "Plaster of Paris" that do not use the statues of Ganesh ji.
Why not use Ganesh ji made of soil of village pond
The statues made by the UPP are not favorable for the environment.
They have expressed great pain, others have also done it.
I also pray to you all, why do not we use the soil, the statues of Ganesh, Durga - why not come back to that old tradition.
Protecting the environment, protecting our rivers and ponds, protecting small organisms of this water from pollution in it - this is also the service of God.
Ganesh ji is a wildlife.
So we should not make such a ganesh, which creates a disturbance.
I don't know, how will you take these things to me
But this is not just me saying, there are many people and I have heard many times about many - a sculptor of Pune, Shriman Abhijit Dhondfale, Kolhapur Institutes Nisarg-friend, Science Prabodhini.
Nisarg-Katta in Vidarbha region, Gyan Prabodhini of Pune, Girgavacha Raja of Mumbai.
Many such institutions, people work very hard for soil ganesh, also campaign.
Co-friendly Ganeshotsav - This is also a social service work.
There is still time between Durga Puja.
Now we decide that the idols that our old families used to make will also get employment and will be made from the soil of the pond or river, then the environment will also be protected.
All of you give great good wishes to Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa will be honored with the title of Saint on September 4.
Mother Teresa had put her whole life for the service of poor in India.
He was born in Albania.
His language was not English too.
But he covered his life.
Efforts have been made to make the poor eligible for service.
When Mother Teresa receives the title of Saint, then it is very natural for all Indians to be proud.
In the ceremony that will be held on September 4, a official delegation will also be sent by the Government of India, led by our Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj on behalf of hundreds of millions of people.
From the saints, from the sages, from the munis, from the great men, we get to learn something every moment.
We will continue to find something, learn and keep doing something good.
When my dear countrymen, development becomes a mass movement, how big is the change.
Manashakti is considered to be the form of God.
The Government of India has made a successful effort to connect people to clean Ganga, clean Ganga with the cooperation of 5 State Governments in the past.
On the 20th of this month, those people were invited in Allahabad who were the heads of the villages living on the banks of the Ganges.
There were also men, women too.
They came to Allahabad and the heads of the villages of Ganga coast took oath in the witness of the mother Ganga that they would immediately stop the tradition of defecation in their villages of Ganga coast, campaign for toilets and the village in Ganga Safai will fully contribute that the village will not allow Ganga to be dirty.
I come to Allahabad for this resolution, no one came from Uttarakhand, no one came from Bihar, no one came from Jharkhand, no one came from West Bengal, I congratulate them for this work.
I also congratulate all the ministries of the Government of India, congratulate those ministers who fulfilled this imagination.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the 5 states that they took an important step in the cleaning of the Ganges by adding manpower.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch me very much and those who imagine it, I also have a special respect for those people.
On July 15, more than seventeen-seven students of schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh wrote a letter collectively to their parents.
Someone wrote in English, someone wrote in Hindi, someone wrote in Chhattisgarhi, he wrote a letter from his parents and said that Toilet should be in our house.
He asked for Toilet, some boys also wrote that this year will not celebrate my birthday, so it will run, but make Toilet sure.
I
These children from seven to seventeen years of age did this work.
And this was so effected, so much emotional impact happened that after receiving the letter, when the school came the second day, the parents caught him a letter to Teacher and in that the parents promised that till the Falani date, he would make Toilet.
Those who came to this imagination, congratulated those students who also tried, congratulated those students and specially congratulated those parents who decided to make their child's letter serious and make Toilet work.
That's what gives us inspiration.
Koppal district of Karnataka, Mallamma, a daughter of sixteen years old in this district - this daughter made Satyagraha against her family.
He sat on Satyagraha.
It is said that he had left food and he too did not ask for anything, not to bring good clothes, not to eat any sweets, the daughter Mallamma's jid was that Toilet should be in our house.
Now there was no financial condition of the family, daughter was stuck on jid, she was not ready to leave her satyagraha.
Mohammad Shafi, the head of the village, came to know that Mallamma has satyagraha for Toilet, then see the specialty of the village's head Mohammad Shafi that he installed eighteen thousand rupees and made a lot of Toilet within a week.
Look at this daughter Mallamma's jid and look at the head of a village like Mohammad Shafi.
How to solve the problems, how to open the path, this is the manpower I
My dear countrymen, "Clean India" has become the dream of every Indian."
Some Indians have become a resolution.
Some Indians have made it their own issue.
But everyone is associated with it in some form, everyone is contributing to it.
Everyday news comes, how new efforts are being made.
There has been an idea in the Government of India and has called upon the people to make a film of two minutes, three minutes cleanliness, send it to the Government of India, you will get its information on Website.
It will be talented and the victorious will be rewarded on October 2, Gandhi Jayanti.
I also tell T.V. Channel people that you should also compete with such films.
Retivity can also give a point to cleanliness campaign, new Slogans will be found, new ways will be known, new inspiration will be found and all this is from public participation, general artists and it is not necessary that big Studio should make films and should be bigger
Hey, nowadays you can film your Mobile Phone's Camera.
Come on, move forward, you have my invitation.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to deepen our relations with our neighbors, our relations are comfortable, our relations are alive.
One very important thing happened in the past, our President's honorable Pranab Mukherjee launched a new program in Kolkata "Akashwani Friendship Channel".
Now many people will feel that should the President inaugurate a radio's channel too
But this isn't normal Radio's hannel, it's a very important step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know, Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
So here "Akashwani Friendship" and "Bangladesh Beatar"
They will share contacts among themselves and on both sides the Bangla-speaking people will enjoy "Akashwani".
People to People Contact has a huge contribution to the "Akashwani".
President ji launched it.
I also thank Bangladesh for this that they are associated with us for this work.
I also congratulate the friends of Akashwani that they are giving their contribution even in foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the job of the Prime Minister, but now I am also a human being like you.
And sometimes the emotional events touch me a lot.
Such emotional events also give new energy, give new inspiration and this is what inspires the people of India to pass somewhat.
In the past, I got a letter, touched my mind.
A 84-year-old mother, who is retired teacher, wrote this letter to me.
If he had not forbidden me in his letter that never to declare my name, then my mind was that today I should give him the name and he wrote that when you left Gas Subsidy, I had left Gas Subsidy and later I had forgotten.
But in the past, a person came and gave me a letter.
I got thank you for this give it up.
For me, the letter of the Prime Minister of India is not less than a Padma Shri.
Countrymen, you will know that I have tried to send a letter to the people who left the Gas Subsidy and some of my representatives will send them a letter.
I am trying to write letters to more than one crore people.
Under the same scheme, my letter reached this mother.
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job.
Your campaign to release poor mothers from stove smoke and so I am a retired teacher, in a few years my age will be 90 years, I am sending you a donation of 50 thousand rupees, so that you work to free such poor mothers from the smoke of stove.
You can imagine, as a general teacher, the mother passing on retired pension, when 50 thousand rupees and poor mothers and sisters are allowed to free from stove smoke and give gas connection.
The question is not of 50 thousand rupees, the question is of that mother's spirit and such blessings are their blessings, which makes my country's future trust and strength.
And he did not even write me as the Prime Minister.
Directly wrote letter - "Modi Bhaiya"
I salute that mother and salute the mothers of India that they always do something to do good to anyone by suffering themselves.
My dear countrymen, we were troubled due to famine last year, but this August month was constantly filled with flood difficulties.
There were frequent floods in some parts of the country.
State Governments, the Central Government, the local Swaraj Institute units, social institutions, citizens, whatever they can do, have their best efforts.
But among the news of these floods, there were also some news that had to be remembered more.
What is the strength of unity, walk together, how big can the result be achieved
It will remember the August month of this year.
In August 2016, the party, which has a gross political opposition, did not leave a single chance against each other, and almost 90 parties across the country, a lot of parties in Parliament, all parties together passed the law of GST.
Its credit goes to all parties.
And if all the parties go in one direction, then this is an example of how big it works.
In the same way, in relation to the situation of Kashmir, all the political parties of the country talked about Kashmir with one voice.
He also sent a message to the world, also sent a message to separatist elements and expressed our condolences to the citizens of Kashmir.
And as much interaction as I got from all the parties in relation to Kashmir, one thing from everyone was definitely awake.
If I have to accumulate him in less words, then I will say that unity and Mamta, these two things remained in the original mantra.
And we all have the opinion of hundreds of millions of people, from the head of the village to the Prime Minister, the opinion is that if anyone knows in Kashmir, whether it belongs to a young man or a security worker, this loss is ours, it is only for your own country.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by furthering these small children, sometimes they will have to answer these innocent children too.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big.
Diversity is filled with.
To maintain the country full of diversity in the bond of unity, as a citizen, as a society, as a government, we all have the obligation to emphasize unity, highlight more and then by going, the country can make its bright future, and become
I believe in the power of hundreds of millions of people.
Today, just so much, thank you very much.
