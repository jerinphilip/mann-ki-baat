My favourite countrymen on January 2017, greeting all of you
Everyone celebrated our Republic Day on 26th January with every corner of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duty of citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to the folk system - this is a sense of reconstruction which involves the next generation of democracy in the awareness of the responsibility of democracy.
But now, in our country, citizens' duty and citizens should be subjected to as much as the debate should be deeply altered as it should be widely discussed.
I hope at every level, at every moment, as strong as it is given, should be put on the obligation.
On both the paths of right and duty, the folk system of India can proceed.
Yesterday 30th January, our Pujanibapur sacred date.
On January 30, at 11 o'clock in the morning, we celebrate 2 minutes of joy, offer homage to the command of the deadly martyrs for the country.
In a united society, as a country, on 30th January, 11th-minute honourfulness - it should be our normal habit.
Two minutes, but there's a similarity, there's a skeleton and a honour for the martyrs.
A simple sympathy is expressed to our country's soldiers.
I congratulate the Veer Jews who have been honored in the secrecy award and the members of his family at the beginning of the Republic Day.
Among these awards there are many departments of ' Kirti Chakra ' , ' Shaurya Chakra ' , ' First Special Service Medals ' .
I'm specially asking for the newborns - You're very active in the social media, can you do one thing
This time Jovie has been honored - find out the internet and write his admiration and reach the service to his friends.
When we know about their courage, separation and paracrama, it is astonishing as it is, it is proud and inspired.
On the one hand, when we were enjoying the news of the anniversary of January 26-10, at the same time our army personnel in Kashmir, who were steady in the security of the country, their heroes in the valley.
I appreciate respect and respect for all these heroes.
My young friends, you know better that I'm listening to a sequel.
January, February, March, April - Every month every family is tested.
One or two children are tested in the world - but the whole family remains under the pressure of the test .
So I thought this was the real time to talk to the students.
To talk to their apprehensive.
To talk to their teachers.
Because for a few years wherever I went, I've spoken to those, I've seen the test caused a big calamity.
Family stress, student stress, teacher tension. A very strange psychological environment can be seen in every world.
And I always thought I should come out of it and that's why I want to talk to Esmper with young friends in detail.
When I announced this, then many teachers, patrons, students sent me messages, asked questions, consulted, painted, mentioned tensions, and after seeing that I felt that I wanna take part with you today.
I sent a message on the telephone from the creation.
What are you supposed to be: "Sir, I just want you to do that at the time of the test, it's almost like our home, in the neighborhood, our society is a terrible and frightening environment.
It doesn't inspire the students, but it becomes very foolish.
So I want you to know that this environment can't be happy
Anyway, the question has arisen, but this same question is certainly in your mind.
The test should be a joy.
We've been working all the year, there's a chance to tell you, it should be an excitement.
There are very few guys who test a pleasure.
Most of the tests are a pressure. You have to decide that you think it is presure, no pleasure.
The pressure man will suffer.
And so it's like me to test a festival.
Take the test in such a way as it's a festival.
And when the festival comes, the best thing in us comes out.
At the time of the festival, society is aware of its own strength.
The best thing is published.
Ordinarily, I think how many ranges are we, but when we look at Kumbh Mail's management for 40-45 days, then the importance of Make-shift Arrangement and the range between humans.
This festival is our strength.
At the time of the test, there should be a festival in the family, in friends, in the neighborhood.
You'll see this pressure will turn into happiness.
Festivals will liberate you.
And here I'm going to ask for more parents that you prepare a three-four-month festival.
Please play the role of yourselves to succeed this festival like a team.
Look how fast it changes.
The truth is that Kanyakumarika from Kashmir, Kachh Sekamrup, Arunachal from Amreli is only three-four months of testing and testing.
Our everybody's responsibility is that every three-four months in his own way, following the traditions of the neighbourhood, understanding the environment of his own family, it's a celebration.
And so I'll tell you, "Smile More Score More", as much as you can spend this time in joy, as much as you get.
Do it.
And you've seen when you're enjoying, laughing, you feel relaxed yourself.
You're very simple to relax, and when you're relaxed, you're easier to remember one year old.
A year ago, you remember the whole view of the teacher in Clausroom.
And you must know that the power to remember is the most relaxation.
If you're in distress, all the doors are closed.
The outside things don't come in, it doesn't go out.
The judge goes away, it's a problem.
You'll be watching at the time of the test, there's almost a lot of things you remember, the book remembers the mind, the chapter, remembers the number of leaves, so it looks like it's not down on the leaves.
But I don't remember a particular word.
Whatever test you get out of the end and the test, it feels surprisingly - Hey, that's the word
Why didn't you remember at the time of the test - because you were pressing.
How did you remember when you came out
Nobody told me
I remembered it because you've become terrilaxed.
That's why it's the most obligation of memoryrecal relaxation that I'm telling my experience.
When we stay in Pressure, we forget a lot of things, but when we relax, we remember a lot of weights and jobs.
It doesn't mean you don't have any knowledge or information or you're not trying.
But when you stay at the tension, everything is printed.
That's why, "A happy mind is a good mark sheet for the secret, "i.e. the basic spell for better results in the test is slow, relaxed.
Sometimes I think we can't see the test right.
Then it looks like the question of life and death.
The test means that you've been studying for a year.
It's not life-death.
How was your life, how you're now, it's not his test.
You will not be tied up in the sequence of the classroom, and you will have to face a very difficult test in your life.
Therefore, the success or failure of life depends on school exams.
We're in front of us, the brightest vision of the President of the PJ.
He wanted to join the airsense but he was ungrateful.
If he was disappointed after this failure, would India have received such a great scientist - such a president
Don't get it.
John Richa enjoyed me: "The biggest problem in the education system, it is fully monitored centre.
The number of tests is the most important.
Which has not only increased competition among the children and the children, the tension has increased.
I want to know your opinion about the present situation and future of the education system.
"However Richa answered his question, he wanted to know my opinion with him.
The significance of the test number is very limited.
That's not everything in life.
The survival of life is : You really gained knowledge and how much you used it in your life.
Reality is the purpose of life and the goal of life.
Did you do that
Whenever you're able to make this sympathy, you don't have to run behind the test number - but he'll come to you on his own.
Whatever you really have in your life is - your mastered knowledge, your skill, your self-confidence and imagination.
You're the ones you're sure there's someone in your family... you're a family doctor.
Have you ever asked him how many numbers he got in the investigation
Not sure.
You think he's a good doctor, he needs you to go to him.
When you go to Namiukil during the bigger case, do you explore his marksheet
You see his experience, his knowledge and success.
That's why this number is sometimes in our right way.
But it doesn't mean that studies don't need.
It's a measure for yourself.
Where I was yesterday, for the valuation of where I am today, both the costs and tests are required.
Self-sufficiently, you'll see that when you run for the first number, you're looking for a simple way and paying attention to certain things.
But you're getting unprecedented when there's a problem outside this shit.
When I aimed at gaining knowledge, I've done all things to myself.
But when the number is the main objective of getting, your knowledge has become complicated and you have limited yourself to a throne.
And that's why sometimes this happens to be very successful in the test and we face failure in life.
Richa has raised one more thing, it's a competition.
It's a very big psychological conflict.
Really, the competition is not very important in the way of life's progress.
Whatever you need, it's yourself.
Should we be targeting how we can enhance the future more than the past
I can admire all the opportunities in the future.
It's the best example we found in the game.
I'm sure I'm sighting the game.
Maximum successful players are specialized by themselves.
In this case, we can give the example of Shachin Tendulkar.
For twenty years, he broke his records in the field of games, defeated himself and became more accustomed.
His life is very cruel.
He's chosen the same competition instead of the external competition.
Friends, especially when you're going to examine every round of life, look at me if you're gonna spend two hours before, have you done it for three hours
In the past, when you thought of getting up, it was too late, can you get up at the right time
I didn't sleep at night in the first observation.
Can you sleep in peace now
Enquire yourself in the papers.
Look, the competition gives rise to defeat, despair, despair and jealousy.
But the power of self-confidence, the vital imagination of yourself.
When I published myself like this, there is an inspiration and inspiration to move forward in a self-provoking manner.
There's no external inspiration.
You-you create a power from inside.
If you explain the matter simply, I'll tell you that when you oppress anyone, there's about three types of probability.
First, you're the best of the others, secondly you're safe from the other, and thirdly you both have the same power.
If you're the best, don't care about yourself, you're more confident.
If you do a bad result with others, you'll be sick, jealous.
This jealousy will disrupt you.
And if you're the same power, you're not gonna bring about self-confidence.
As the car goes on, it's going to be like that.
That's why I'll request you to contest with myself.
What I've done before, then I have to worry about how to do it and how to do it better.
That's why you'll feel a lot of change.
Mr. S. Sundar has expressed his concern about the role of the guardians.
According to him, the guards have a positive role in the test.
She wrote more: "My mother didn't know the special writing, but she was sitting next to me.
Tell me to scratch.
He looked at the answer when he was scratched.
This way he helped me.
Give me the wrong.
My mother couldn't pass the 10th test, but I couldn't pass the CBSE test if she didn't get help.
Beautiful, you're right.
You must have noticed that those who ask me questions, advise them, more of them.
In fact, the mother is very conscious about the future of her children.
Stay active.
They simplify a lot of things.
I'll ask the defendants to force the three divisions.
Confession, teaching and giving time.
Please accept what's there.
Do as much as your strength as you do, and give time out of time as much as you do.
If you learn to admit once, there's a lot of problems to be solved.
Each conspirator must assume that the expectation of the patrons and teachers is the root cause of all problems.
If you don't accept it, you're gonna get rid of this problem.
Hope makes the road hard.
Acknowledging the present situation, there's a chance to open the solution.
So accept what is there.
Look, you'll be free.
We talk about the weight of the school bags of little children, but sometimes I've got you - hope for the parents, more than the school bags of children.
Many years ago, because of a heart attack, one of our familiars was in hospital.
Ganesh Dada Mabalankar's son, the first speaker of the Indian Academy, went to the hospital to see the sick man of the Sansad Mabalankar.
I was present at that time.
I saw he didn't ask any questions about the physical problem of a sick person.
He sat there and saw the situation there, he started listening to a lot of things without talking about the disease and in two-four minutes he blew the atmosphere there.
Actually, we're gonna have a fear in his mind about the disease to the sick.
I'm supposed to say that sometimes we're like this with the little ones.
Have you ever thought I'd give children a smile on the day of the test.
You'll see the situation changes.
I have a funny call.
The gentleman didn't mean his name.
If you hear the details of the phone, you can understand why the person doesn't want to publish his name.
"Namaskar, Chief Minister, I did something in my childhood that I didn't tell my name.
I tried to duplicate once in my childhood.
I've had a lot of time to think about what I'm gonna do.
I could get the same number when I spent for study.
When I duplicately tried to cross, I was caught and I had trouble for many friends around me.
"You're right.
That's the reason to duplicate the work.
Sometimes I'm not supposed to believe in myself. I think I've seen a little from the neighbors.
I didn't confirm, I didn't know if it was right.
Sometimes it's like I wrote it right, but I've written the neighborhood, and I've killed that mistake just because of myself.
So there's no use of nails.
"To chaat is to beachep, so please, do not chat" means duplication.
So don't copy.
Don't duplicate, fakes are bad.
Don't duplicate. You've heard it many times.
I'm telling you the same thing again.
Whatever you don't see, take the fake life into failing and keep an eye on you at the time of the test, it's all over and if you don't fall, you'll understand your gratitude on your mind.
You can't talk to your kids while you're talking to them.
And if the duplication becomes a regular habit, there will be no desire to teach anything in life.
Where are you going to reach
Imagine, you're looking for your own way, creating the meaningless resistance.
I've seen that some people are using all their talents and using creative power to duplicate.
If you'd spend this time, time and creative power for studies, you wouldn't have to imitate.
The self-confidence that will increase in your hard work is incomparable.
I got a phone: "Namasker, Chief Minister
My name is Manika and I'm a twin-square student.
I want to ask you a few questions about board examination.
How to reduce the pressure on our mind at the time of my first question.
And my second question is, why are you studying
Why don't you have any defects in this game
Thank you.
"If I'm gonna talk about the game at the time of the test, then everyone will say - How Prime Minister
You're gonna play kids at the time of the test
Because the ordinary people think that if the readers mind the game, they will be neglected in studies.
The root of this idea is wrong.
As much as the problem is there.
A funny life out of study for all-round development is also a bigger role.
That's the age of experience for the success of that life.
Many say - I've done all the tests, then I'm going to play, and then everything else will be done - it's not a strange idea.
That's the time to make life.
In fact, we need to remember three extremely important things for the success of the test.
There is an important role in the body for sufficient rest, body needed sleep and simultaneous mental work - it must also be remembered .
Besides the brain, the rest of the body should be active.
Have you ever thought, looked out of the house and looked at the sky, looking at the nature of a few trees, the head would be very light, you'd be able to read a lot freshly back to the house to read.
Whatever you say, get the trap of reading out of the wheel.
If you're in a kitchen, you're supposed to have a favorite lunch, you're supposed to love a biscuit, eat, enjoy a little, laugh.
If you have a break for five minutes, you'll feel that you're having a lot of mind to read.
I don't know if everyone likes this, but I'm talking about my confidence.
It's very beneficial for dep breading at this time.
Take a deep breath, look like relaxed.
You can't breathe in any room.
Go below the sky out of the house, get back to the house with a five-minute breath, and sit back to the house - look relaxed for the head, how fresh the rest of the rest
Many think it's too much to wake up at night.
This guess is always wrong.
You don't have to take the rest of your body, you don't want to read it, you'll have the power to study on the opposite, your concentration will increase, you need a lot of freshness, freshness.
Your specific dynamic will increase.
I'm supposed to have a meeting, sometimes my throat.
Once a folk singer came to meet me.
How long did he ask me to sleep
I wanted to know, brother, are you a doctor
He said, no, no, no, you don't have to say, it's related to your throat to give me this obsession.
If you sleep properly, your food card will also get rest.
I didn't think of my sleep and throat sound before.
He gave me a simple torch.
Look at you, this advice comes to you.
So don't think that the Prime Minister says there's no need to wake up.
Don't forget that.
Your apprehensions will be disappointed with me.
Otherwise, the day the marksheet arrives, the parents will see my talents instead of your dreams.
Then it'll work when you're lying. Don't worry.
That's why I say, Por Prepared and P for Play.
The one that eats is shining.
person who plays, shines.
My mind, intelligence, the sports of the body are also in a finite role.
Young guys, you think we're busy studying the test and I've taken you with the "Man What Walt"
That's how I worked for your relaxation today.
But I'm gonna tell you about it, don't worry about what I'm saying.
If you agree, don't you.
I wouldn't have caused you to worry.
Like I want your parents to get rid of the tension, I want to remain stressless.
I know your visions, go to test my self-confidence, relax my heart for you.
Please celebrate a challenge to face any challenge, see that there will be no challenge Archlenz.
Go ahead with this spell.
Dear foreigners, this year's 1-1 February, the Indian Coast Guard has been completing forty years.
On this occasion, every worker and army of the Coast Guard is congratulations and thanks for their country's duty.

Last year, the Coast Guard team had planned to keep the seashore clean with their original work, and thousands of ordinary patriots were also involved in that work.
The sea surroundings of the ocean have also imagined the cleverness of the sea, their congratulations
Many of you don't know, there are not only men in the Coast Guard Army, but also women.
They're fighting men with shoulders and carrying their responsibility with great success.
We have a female pilot officer at the Coast Guard, they're supposed to handle the command of Emnki Hovercraft.
Our Coast Guard Army is taking important care of India's sea safety and sea surveillance.
I'll give them a lot of congratulations in their 40 years.
Basant Pachmadi will be celebrated on February 1.
This festival is as a recognition of the best season spring.
Basant prince.
Saraswati is worshipped only in spring-panchami.
For the teaching of science, it is for worship.
Not only a scholarship, but also a festival of inspiration for semen.
It's the inspiration of the Color Devasanti Chola.
I'm glad to give my inner pleasure to the residents of this spring-five origin.
My dear dwellers, the "Man Ki Walt" program has filled the sky with a lot of alternate ideas.
Last month, after observing my "Man Ki Waat" speech, he has heard the "Man Ki Waat" in the Organic language.
There's a great success in this effort.
It's been written by the natives far and wide.
I'm telling them a lot of congratulations for this self-provoking effort.
Countrymen, I'm giving you a lot of congratulations.
My communication bridge has been built with you with the help of "Man Ki Wat".
Thank you very much.
