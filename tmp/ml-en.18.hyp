Prime Minister Mr.
On the 27th day of Narendra Modi 2017, the Tamilnadu language of the special launch conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population at 11 a.m., says my dear countrymen are respected.
On one side, when the country is drowned in festivals, on the other hand, the news of Himsa from any part of the Hindustan would be hazardous in the country.
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi.
Life for the unity of the country is the kingdom of Sardar Patel.
For centuries, our ancestors have acknowledged the honor of common life, Ahimsa, which is part of our mind.
We've been telling Ahimsa Paramodhram since childhood.
In the name of faith, it does not allow Himsa to believe in religion or political beliefs or traditions, I said from the red fort.
Nobody has the right to take law in the name of faith.
Dr.
In the administration given by Babasaheb Ambedkar, there is a system of justice for all persons.
This country will never allow a government, even if it is individual, whoever takes the law into the hands of Himsa.
Everyone will have to head in front of the law.
The law will determine responsibility and punish the culprits.
Our country is full of variations.
These variations are not only in food or lifestyles.
We can see diversity in all the heads of life.
Our festivals are full of variations.
Our cultural heritage of our compassions is ancient, seem to be watching the cultural traditions, watching the historical events, there will be no unprecedented day in 365 days.
Looking at all our festivals, there is no festival associated with the time of nature.
Everything is directly related to nature.
Many of our festivals are connected to farmers, they are directly involved in fishing.
Today, when I talk about the festivals, I first wish to tell you 'Middamn sadness'.
Yesterday's celebration was celebrated at the Jain community.
Festivals are held in the Jain community in the month of Bhadra.
The last day of the festival of 'Tournal' is the day of celebration.
It's really a tradition of wonder.
The festival is a symbol of forgiveness, ahimsa and friendship.
This is called 'Kshamawani' festival.
In this day, there is a tradition of greeting each other with the name of 'Michami Dukdam'.
In our sciences, the impatient humiliation, i . e . the forgiveness hero is called earthquake.
The forgiving man becomes a hero.
This is what we hear.
Mahatma Gandhi always used to say, "It is the privilege of a strong person to forgive".
Shakespeare, indicating the importance of forgiveness in his drama 'Murchant of Venice', wrote, 'Mercey Eis Tivas Blasset, It's Blasset Him Datt Gives Him Datt Takes', and those who forgive and forgive God's favour.
My dear countrymen, this is the time to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthy on all the corners of Hindustan.
It's natural to remember the Ganesh festival when talking about Ganesh Chaturthi.
Lokmanya Balgangadhara Teller started this festival 125 years ago.
It turned into a symbol of freedom before independence.
After independence, social education is a symbol of social development.
Ganesh Chaturthy Festival is held for ten days.
This festival is also a symbol of unity, equality, purifying.
A lot of good luck for all the natives of the Ganesh festival.
It's time to celebrate in Kerala.
One of the colorful festivals of India is the main festival of Kerala.
It's important to social and cultural.
The Honor shows the rich cultural jewelry of Kerala.
This festival, with the message of love and harmony in the society, brings new enthusiasm and new confusion in the minds of the people.
Now this festival turns into a encouraging sports.
In Gujarat , Navratri festival and Durga Puja Festival in Bengal can be seen in a different way attracting roaming .
Our festivals are an opportunity to attract foreigners.
Think what we can do in this matter.
The 'Edul Suha' will be celebrated after a few days.
It's a pleasure for all the natives.
Many good lucks.
With festivals becoming a symbol of devotion and faith, we have to make it a symbol of purifying in new India.
Festivals and purity are related to each other in family life.
It means to prepare for the festival to make cleans and shoots.
It's not new to us.
But it must be a social nature.
Normally, it's not only in our village, in our city, our country, our country.
So purity must be a part of our celebrations that cannot be separated.
My dear countrymen are changing the obligations of becoming modern.
There's a new head, a new pattern.
How cultured you are, how modern you are, how modern your thoughts are, is using a table to know.
That's how you're aware of the situation.
Your activity is naturally beautiful, environmentally friendly behavior is tested in that balance that is against yours or yours.
If there is a opposite behavior, then it's considered to be bad.
So now, in this Ganesh festival, there is a big crowd on the need for environmentally friendly Ganpati.
You'll see in the tube that every house makes the children generated by soil.
I'll see the color of leaves and vegetables in a suitable manner.
Some occupy the papers.
Several types of experiments are carried out in every family.
In a way, such a widespread training about environmental awareness has never been done before.
Media establishments also inspire people to create natural genesis statues in larger people.
See how big the change is, how happy it is.
As I said, the country is full of intellectual winds.
Someone feels very happy to know about the new discovery.
Someone said that an engineer mixed some specific kind of soil and so trained to create a genesis.
In a small thorn of water, when it is offered to the ganesh, it gets mixed quickly in the water.
He didn't stop it.
Put the basil seeds in it.
Fucking basils.
Three years ago, the 'Publicity Campaign' started, it will be three years on October 2.
Its results are starting to see.
The toilets were 39 percent now 67 percent.
Two lakhs of more than thirty thousand villages have been declared free from external immersion.
In the past, there was a huge flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives.
But after the flood, when the water came, the dirt spread everywhere.
In that case, in Dhanora of Banaskanth district of Gujarat, the workers of 'Jamaat Ulama and Hindi' cleaned 22 temples and 3 mosques affected by water.
Sweating.
Everybody moved forward with excitement.
It was an excellent example of accuracy.
The example of everybody's motivation is 'Jama Ulama Ye Hind'.
If our sustainable nature is an attempt to devote ourselves to self-confidence, how high our country will be.
My dear countrymen, before the name of 'Jan Seva itself God Seva', Gandhi Jayanti, on October 2, will be launched from 15-20 days before the day of 'Security itself'.
The country can make the environment of cleanliness.
We'll introduce the importance of cleaning.
That's what we need together.
It can be considered in a way as a preparation for Deepawali, as a preparation for Navratri, as a preparation for Durga Puja.
I'm calling you.
Let's try it.
Let's work together on holidays or Sundays.
We can go to the nearby village on the street.
But you must act like a gentleman.
All government organizations, schools and colleges, social cultural, political leadership and government officials and collectors and graduates - We can work 15 days before the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2.
On October 2, we can create a dirty atmosphere for 2 October in Gandhiji's dream.
Ministry of Drinking Pollution, 'MiGOV.
There's a sec.
After building the toilet, you'll get your name in the portal and your family's name.
My friends in social media can make some creative initiatives.
Let Verchwol work on the head of the world, inspire.
In the matter of 'Swachh Sankalp Se Swachh Siddhi', the Ministry of Drinking Pollution is conducting an article competing, composition of Lughu composition.
In this you can write articles in different languages, there is no age.
You can make short films on your own mobile.
You can create a two-three-minute poor film that inspire cleanliness.
In which language can be, it can be a silly miracle.
One of those who participate in this competition will be chosen.
The district head and the state level will be given the award of three.
I'm sorry for everyone, come.
In this effort of purity, you will also participate.
I once said that this time, on October 2, the Gandhiji's day will be dull-free October 2, for this, from September 15, bring the memorandum of 'voluntary service' every home.
Please redress something for purification.
Work yourself as a partner.
You'll see how bright it will be on October 2, Gandhiji's day.
After the 15-day dynamic construction, after the program 'Secure Service', we will be able to enjoy the honor of honorable Baba when we celebrate Gandhiji on October 2.
My dear countrymen, today I want to explain a special deal with you.
I express gratitude to you from the depths of the heart.
It's obvious.
Because millions of people from all over the country participate in this program called Man Kee Bath.
Millions of people who listen.
But millions of people write me a letter, or message, sometimes called.
This is a big treasure for me.
It's a great opportunity for me to know the mind of the country's democracy.
I'm waiting for your message as much as you wait for Man Kee Ba.
I'm glad I'm waiting for everything you say.
There's a chance to change what I do.
I use your little things to think of many things with a new vision.
So I express gratitude to you in the name of your contributions.
I'm sorry.
You know what you're talking about and listening and reading yourself and you're inspiring me.
Now you'll see how you're connected to yourself through a phone conversation that's going to hear.
You'll think about yourself, or I've done this wrong.
Some things sometimes become a part of our nature that we don't even think we're wrong.
'Mother, I'm talking to Puna.
I want to tell you about one of my friends.
She's always trying to help people.
But I'm surprised to see her another nature.
I once went to the mall with her shopping.
She spent two thousand rupees for a sari and spent 450 rupees for a pizza.
But the auto driver who had gone to the mall fortunate about five rupees.
Buy the vegetables on the way back.
In its name, the price was profited by 4-5 rupees.
I felt so bad.
We're paying in big places without questioning the price at any time.
But the brothers who depend on us for some money.
They're unbelievable.
You must tell me about it at Man Key Bay.
'I'm sure you'll be surprised after hearing this phone.
I'm surprising.
I must have decided not to repeat this mistake on the floor.
We're selling goods at our house with those who sell it... with a small shopkeeper, vegetable sellers.
Otherwise, the auto rickshaws begin to negotiate those who try to live on us.
He argues for mature and weight.
It's not the same, it'll be said to reduce two bucks and reduce five rupees.
But when we're going to eat in a big restaurant, we're paying the money immediately without seeing what's in Bill.
It's not just that if you go shopping in the showroom, you're gonna buy it without paying any luggage.
But if there's anything related to poverty, there's no argument.
They don't have a problem of two forms or five forms.
But his heart shines that you doubt the universe because he's poor.
There's no change in your life with two forms or five.
But have you ever thought of your little habit in his mind how deep it hurts
Madam, I'm gratitude to make a great message through this heart-brained phone call.
I'm sure my people will surely leave this habit in the behavior of poverty.
My dear young friends are celebrating the country on August 29.
Great Hockey player, this is the birthday of Indrajalam Wild Major Dhyan Chand in Hockey.
His contributions to Hockey were ineffective.
I'm saying this is because of the desire to connect with the youngest Sports in our country.
The games must be part of our life.
If we think we're a young country in our world, we must see our children in sports.
Sports is a physical fitness, mantle alardens, personality anhancing.
What more do you want.
The games are a kind of great medicine for the unity of minds.
Our country has to come forward in the youthful sports.
Playing fields - I want to warn this computer today more important than the plainstation.
Play the fif in the computer.
But outside plays and sometimes show your own right in football.
Crackets are playing in the computer, but in the open ground, the joy of playing cricket under the sky is different.
There was a time when the kids came out.
When the children arrive at home, they start watching a cartoon movie at one corner, otherwise they sit with the mobile phone. It's a matter of asking you to get out.
It's a change of time.
It's time you had to ask you to go back and ask you to go out.
Young friends, the Sports Ministry has prepared a Sports Talent Cort Port.
Video can also be uploaded if any child in the country who has made any benefit in the field of sports.
The Ministry of Sports will train the growing sports and will be uploaded tomorrow.
In India, from October 6 to 18, the Phief Under 17 Wald Cups are going to be known to the young people.
The 24 teams around the world are going to make India their own home.
Welcome young guests from all over the world with a sports festival, enjoy games, and create the atmosphere of games across the country.
It's reminded of what happened to the heart of the past day when we talk about sports.
It wants to tell the people.
I had a chance to see some young girls.
Some of them were born in the Himalayas.
They didn't have any connection with the ocean.
The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of the 6 girls working in Navy will inspire us.
These 6 girls left the sea in a small boat called INS Tarini.
It's called Navika Sagar Infirmary.
They'll be back to India after months around the world.
Perhaps forty days together in the water.
And sometimes 30 days.
These six children walk bravely between waves in the ocean.
This is the first time in the world.
Who is not proud of our girls in this Hindustan
I finish the adventure of these children.
They told them to share their experience with the country.
I'll also arrange to interfere with their experiences in the Naradamodi app.
You have the chance to read it.
Because it will be a story of adventure, a story of experience.
I'm also happy to bring the experiences of those children to you.
These girls have many good lucks and blessings.
My dear countrymen, 5th September celebrates the teacher's day.
Our former President, Dr.
It's the birthday of Radhakrishna.
He was president.
But he said he was a teacher himself.
He always wanted to live as a teacher.
He dedicated himself to education.
He was a philosopher, a diplomat, a president of India, but he was an excited teacher in every sense.
I'm grateful to him.
The great scientist, Albert Einstein said that it is the greatest quality of a teacher who enjoys creativity and knowledge among his students in the teacher of the Superme Cart.
Can't we take a decision this time when we celebrate the teacher's day
Could you make a mission like a mission
Teach to Transform, ducate to empower, teach to ead for change, learn to lead, to lead.
Can you take this mission with a determination
For five years, take a decision, make a way to achieve it, and enjoy the success of life in five years.
For this, create an atmosphere for our schools and our colleges and our teachers and our educational institutions.
When we talk about changes in our country, the teacher will remember in the society as he talks about mother in the family.
Teachers have an important role in changing.
There must be an event in every teacher's life that can change his life through comfortable efforts.
If we work together, we can take a bigger role in changing the nation.
Let's move with the trick to teach for change.
"The prince, the princess."
My name is Dr. Ananya.
I live in the city of Mumbai.
Herward University works for India Research Center.
I'm particularly interested in the economic synthesis and social plans related to it as a researcher.
After three years of this Jandhana Yojana started in 2014, he wants to ask India to show more economically safe, and to tell you that the intestine is strong.
Are our women, peasants, laborers, villages and slums available for education and facilities
Thanks to my dear countrymen, Prime Minister Jandhana Yojana, not only in India but also in the world.
It's a dream in mind that it started this move on August 28, 2014.
Tomorrow, the Prime Minister Jandhan Yojana will be held for three years on August 28.
Thirty-fourths of new families opened bank accounts.
It's more than a population in many countries of the world.
My poor brother, who is at the end of the society in three years, is part of the mainstream of the economy of the country.
Their habits have changed, they're coming to the bank, they're supposed to catch the money, and the money is safe.
I'm very quiet.
Sometimes the money will be in hand, it'll be in the pocket, and it'll be home.
Now there's an atmosphere of restraint.
They have begun to feel that the money will benefit the children in the future.
This money will benefit from doing something good in the coming days.
It's not just that, when you see Rupee Card in your pocket, you feel like the rich.
In the Prime Minister's Jandhana project, our poor have invested around 60 thousand crore rupees in banks.
This is the richness of poverty.
It's their strength in the coming days.
Under the Prime Minister's Jandhana plan, the openers will get the benefit of insurance.
Prime Minister Life Jyoti Bima Yojana, Prime Minister's Security Bima Yojana, is giving birth to a new faith in the life of those poor today with a desirable premium called Rupa or three rupees.
When the poor fell, the lives of the priest of the family broke, some families got two lakh rupees within a few days due to one rupee insurance.
Prime Minister Mudra Yojana, Stard of Yojana, Stand up yojana, but tribes, but women, but a young man who has learned, has decided to do anything from his legs, but millions of other youths have got nothing more than the guarantee from the bank through Prime Minister Modra Yojana.
They stayed on their own legs.
Not just that, everyone has made a successful effort to provide jobs to one or two.
The last day, the bank-related people saw me.
They say they've served the benefits of the common people due to the insufficiency, the Rupee Cardoo, the prime minister's grandson.
It's a matter of great pleasure.
I'm asking the bank officials to say such events are MYGOV.
They must be uploaded in.
Let's read people.
They'll get inspiration through it.
I have hundreds of examples about how a person's life changes, how new energy is filled, how new faith is filled.
I'll try to get them in front of you.
The media can also benefit from this.
They can inspire such people and inspire new generations.
My dear countrymen, I once again thank Mr. Michami.
Thank you very much.
