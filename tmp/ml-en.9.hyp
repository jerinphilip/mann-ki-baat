Man Kee Bath, 2018 May Namaskar.
You've got a chance to communicate with them once more through Man Keeba.
You remember a group of six women campers from the Navy had been traveling in the sea for the past few months.
Navika Sagar Infection - Yes, I want to say something about them.
These six daughters of India, their group, have returned to India on May 21, roaming around the world in the INSV wave over the last nineteen days.
The whole country welcomed them with enthusiasm.
They traveled through various oceans and seas and made about twenty thousand round miles.
This is the first event in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got a chance to see these daughters, listen to their travel experiences.
Once again, I congratulate the world for enhancing the bravery of those wives, promoting the magnificence of India, especially the Indian priests, not bad.
No one's adventure.
If we take care of the development of mankind, we will see progress from the pregnancy of some adventure.
The development is on the lap of adventure.
The decision to do anything, to work out of the public, to do something extraordinarily, to do anything, to do anything, to those who have thoughts, for ages, those who are inspired.
On the other day, Everest climbed the mountains, looking at new things...
For centuries Everest was challenging human beings, the braves accepted that challenge.
On May 16, five tribal children of a Ashram school in Maharashtra Chandrapur, Manisha Dhrue, Pramesh Ale, Umaan Madavi, Kavidas Kathmode, Vikas Soyam, went to the highest peak in the world.
These children of Ashram School started training on August 2017.
They trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Le, Ladakh.
These young men were chosen under the Mashin Shaurya.
Everest conquered the name, and he was proud of the country.
I'm connected to the Chandrapur school, this little bitch enjoys a lot of heart-happiness.
At this time, the 16-year-old Shivangi learner was the youngest Indian girl who won Everest from Nepal.
Shivangi's daughter has a lot of pleasure.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter, Dia and Everest, with the first father and daughter.
Young people don't just climb Everest.
Music Bahal May 19 climbed to Everest.
Sagita Bahal's age is 50 years old.
Someone who climbed the Everest showed them not only the sex, but also those who are sensitive.
Last day, according to Swachh Ganga Abhiyan, a team of BSAF has not only climbed the Everest, but the group brought down all the dirt of Everest.
It's a remarkable thing, and it shows their resistance to purifying and environment.
People have been climbing Everest for years.
It's a lot of successful finishers.
I'm adventurous, especially for all the daughters, with unprecedented admiration.
My dear countrymen, especially young people, didn't think I've been talking about Fit India two months ago.
The numerous people in all areas came forward with the support of it.
When I say Fit India, I think we play as much as the country plays.
In social media, people share video of Fitnas Chalunch.
Tag each other and challenge them.
Everyone is in the Fit India City.
In the fields of the film, the Sports, the ordinary people of the country, the soldiers of the army, the school teachers participated in it, listening to it all around.
If we fit, India and Fit...
Kohli, the captain of the Indian cricket team, has challenged me, and I have accepted his challenge.
It's a good thing.
This challenge will encourage others to be fit with fitting us.
My dear people, you've heard me about games, sportsmen, sometimes in Man Key Bay.
Last time the dogs of Commonwealth Games spoke to us through this program.
"Namaskar, sir
I'm talking to Chhovi Yadav from Noida.
I'm the man who constantly listens to you.
Today I want to tell you my son Keebat.
Now the summer has begun.
I see the children long before Internet.
They play games and play time.
When we were kids, we played more traditional games, Out door games.
There was a game in it.
7 pieces of stones, one of them, the sports, the skull, the khoko.
Everything seems to be without today.
So I request the new generation to tell you about some traditional games.
Thank you for their interest.
"Chhovi Yadavji, thank you very much for calling on the phone.
It's true that playing every street in every street, playing games that are part of every child's life are coming down today.
These games were particularly part of the summer.
Sometimes lunch, sometimes in the night, after dinner, the children used to play for hours without any restlessness.
From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Kabadi, kids and kids, and pearls were part of the childhood of everyone from Kamarup.
There may have been games in many places.
For example, the criminals used to play in many places.
Whatever the fucking guys, the bullshits, the balls and the balls...
There are two types of games in traditional games.
Playing outside and playing in the house.
Outdoor, Indore.
The unity behind our country's diversity can be seen in these games.
The same game is known in different places.
I am from Gujarat.
A game in Gujarat is known by the name of Chomal-Isto.
It's used to be 8:8 pieces of potatoes, or porks, or pieces.
This game often played in all the states.
In Karnataka it was called Chaukabara in Madhya Pradesh.
In Kerala, if the treasures were in the Maharashtriya, then in Tamilnadu, they were called daiya games or tyam sports.
Many names like Changapo in Rajasthan...
But when you play, you know, people from all over the country don't know the language, yes.
I'll tell you we're gonna play this game.
In childhood, there will be someone who doesn't play kids.
It's a game playing in kids and villages and towns.
It was called in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh it was called Gotibilla or Karra Bila.
Gulibadi is called in Odisha.
Vitidaloo is called in Maharashtra.
Some games have their weather, season.
Like a season to fly the city.
When everybody flys the city, everybody plays different qualities in ourselves.
Many kids, we'd have seen a lot of evil.
Their personality appears on its own.
Great people will be serious, but when they play, the child hiding in them comes out.
Traditional sports encourage our genuine thinking, concentration, awareness, swelling, etc. with physical ability.
The games are not just sports, but they teach the roots of life.
Deciding the target, gaining strength, making the Temspirit-conscious, how to co-operate.
In the training program related to business management, our traditional games are being used today to increase the overall personality development (Overral Personality Development ) .
Our games are useful for the overall development of an individual.
Besides, the age of playing these games is not a problem.
The Generation Gap is not supposed to see the dust... when they're all playing from children, grandpa, aunt.
And we know our culture and tradition.
Many games make us aware of the society and the environment.
Sometimes we're afraid of this game, it's not just a game, it'll be without a child.
And only these poems will be heard.
Take this money, take me and take this younger, if you give me a childhood of Callasse, you'll give me the rain water.
We're gonna be singing like this.
So we don't lose these traditional games.
Today, youth groups in schools and villages have to promote this game.
Calling people, we can make a big history of our traditional games.
Let's make video of these games.
It shows the rules of sports and playing methods.
Animation can make films.
By that, our new generation is wonderful to see the games of the streets, play and develop themselves.
Dear people, on the June 5th of our country will take the most honourable day of the world's environment.
This is the great achievement of India.
It shows that in the matter of reducing weather, India's growing leadership is recognized in the world.
This time the fire, defeat the plastic dirt - Beat plastic polution.
I advise you not to use polythene, a low-level plastic, to understand the emotions of the fire.
On the nature of plastic dirt, on wild animals, we can try to reduce the effect of the reflex on our health.
See a lot of views given in a very attractive manner in the World Environment Day Website Wed-India2018, know, try to implement them in daily life.
When it gets too hot, when the rain doesn't finish, when it's cold, all the experts like Global Walming, Climate Changing.
But what's wrong with me
Behave with nature, preserve nature and be our nature.
It must be mixed in our culture.
In the past few weeks, we all saw the swollen swellings and storms in the different parts of the country.
Life and self were ruined.
It's basically a weather difference, its consequences.
Our culture, our tradition taught us not to fight us with nature.
We have to live with nature, we must live together with nature.
Mahatmagandji's life has been promised for all the retreat.
Today, India says about the climate justice, India has played a major role in the cop 21 Paris Convention.
We united the world through the International Solar Alliance.
Behind all this, it was the thought of the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Think of what we can do to keep our planet clean and green on this environment day.
How to move in this matter
What can I do with a new one
It's rainy season.
I'll make sure the record tree will be in the middle this time.
I don't want to wear the trees until it grows up.
Dear countrymen, especially my young friends.
You'll be remembered on June 21.
Not only you, we remember the world as well as June 21.
The whole world celebrates the June 21 International Yoga Day.
It's all agreed.
People start preparing for months.
There are reports that the world's 21st June is preparing to celebrate International Yoga Day.
The Yoga Force Unit for the unit for icon is recognising the world for a few years.
The great poet of Sanskrit is written in the centenary before the great poet of Bhatruhari in the 19th century: Dhairya Yasya Kshama Cha Cha Janani Shanti Shree Gahini Satya Sunurya Daya Chagini Bhagini Bharata Mana Sanyama.
Shayya territory Disholpi dwelling , wisdom food , jewellery , widow comrade , Kasmad fear , yoga .
The meaning of this thing that has been mentioned in centuries is that some good quality becomes like relatives due to regular practice.
Yoga always has the courage to wait for us like a father.
Mum is sorry for children.
Peace becomes our constant mixture.
Grandfather says that by doing yoga regularly, the truth changes as our children, our spiritual brothers, our bed and knowledge becomes our hunger.
If these qualities are friends, yogi wins all kinds of fear.
I once again ask all the people to create a healthy, comfortable and wealthy nation to promote our spirit as a yoga.
Dear countrymen, May 27 today.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal is the memory of Nehru.
Promise for Panditji.
This month's memory is related to another person.
Hero survivors.
In the month of May 1957, Indians showed their strength to the English.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and the peasants raised their heroes against injustice.
We've been telling the events of 1857 for a long time only as Lahla or Shipai Lahla.
It wasn't really a very valuable thing, but it was an attempt to challenge our self-respect.
In 1857, Veersavar wrote that the first fight for freedom was not a joke.
The heroes of the Indian House in London, including the Savarkars, celebrated its last year.
It's a miraculous orientation that Veersavarkar was born in the same month that fought for freedom.
Savarker's life was full of virtues.
He was a professor of weapons and science.
Generally Veera is known by the name of his fight against his courage and British rule.
But beyond that, he was a great poet and a social reformer.
He always gave importance to harmony and unity.
One of the best mentions about Savarkerji has been built by our favorite Atal Bihari Wazpaiji.
Aarl ji said, "Thajas, Savarkar, Tyagam, Savarkar, Tapah, Savark, Savarkar, Takka, Savark, Youth, Savark, Savark, Shara, Savarkar, Khadgam.
"How the right painting is that, Atalgie.
Savarkar took poetry and revolution together.
Besides being a sensitive poet, there was also an adventurous revolutionary.
Dear sister brothers...
I'm T.
Vile was watching a program.
About our poor daughters in the only ghetto of Seekar in Rajasthan.
Our daughters, often, were bound to rotate and walk home.
Today, they're studying shoes and dressing poor dresses.
The girls here today keep their families and clothes from ordinary clothes.
They're together with the Nipunya Vikasana Course.
Our daughters are sufficient today.
Gentlemen lead their lives.
The strength of your family has changed.
These wives, full of ideas and beliefs, enjoy good luck for their bright future.
If there's an excitement to do something, it's observed that you can win between all the resistances.
This isn't about Seeker, you can see it all over the corner of Hindustan.
If you look around, people can see how to defeat all the responsibilities.
When we still go to a tea shore, we'll be enjoying the tea there, and some of the neighbors are discussing and discussing.
These discussions can be related to politics, social, films, players, problems of the country.
This can be the solution...
But sometimes these things are settled in discussions.
But some, through their actions, through self-determination, moves towards the direction of bringing changes through surrender, which makes it real.
The story of those who dedicate themselves to fulfill the dreams of others, who live in the hut of Cuttack City of Orissa.
The light of Raaovi.
Yesterday I had the luck to see Prakash Rao.
He's selling tea in the city for the last five decades.
A simple cattle...
You wonder if he knows that education is light in more than seventy children.
He opened a school with the name of 'Asha-Ashwasan' for the children living on the street and the ghetto.
For this, this poor tea sells 50 percent of his composition.
He arranges all the children who come to school for education, health and food.
I'm D.
It's very much appreciated that Prakash Rao's teachings and devotion to the poor children's life.
He left the darkness of his life.
Who does not know the word "Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamya".
But D.
The light shows it's alive.
His life is inspiration for us, society and country.
There'll be many things like this around you.
There will be innumerable events.
Come on, let's encourage us.
It's hot to wait for the rain when it comes in June.
The windows don't drive the glasses for the rainy season.
The moon will wait for a few days.
If you see the moon, I'll celebrate Eid.
After a month's fast in Ramdan, Eid is a symbol of the beginning of the festival.
Everyone thinks Ide will celebrate with great enthusiasm.
On this occasion, especially children get good gifts.
Eid hopes to strengthen our society's harmony and friendship.
Anybody's good luck.
My dear countrymen, thank you for a lot.
Let's get together in Manki Bay next month.
Good luck.
