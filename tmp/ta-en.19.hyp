In the name of Manki Bath (Mandi's voice) Prime Minister Mr.
Norendra Moti Agul's speech in the Indian radio today, the people of the country, silly.
The rainy season is situated in the season of people 's hearts .
Animals, birds, plants, animals all flow through the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when this rain is heavy.
We've come to know how big the water has the power to destroy.
Nature is the mother who enjoys our lives, grows all of us, but sometimes natural dwellers like floods, landscapes, destroy their horrible form.
Changing weather and environmental changes have a negative impact.
For the past few days in some parts of India, especially in Assam, north-east, Gujarat, Rajasthan, parts of Bengal, due to excess rains, natural residents had to face.
Complete monitoring activities are being carried out in the affected areas of the flood.
The most dispersed ways of resistance are also broken.
Successfully, there are Sakaks who are accompanied by the Secretary.
State governments are also making great efforts to help the people suffering from floods in their own way.
Even social structures, cultural structures, civilizations, services, people in this environment are doing their full commitment to helping people.
Military fighters, aircraft fighters, mine.
T.
Ar.
Ep.
I mean, the National Factory Meetbooks, the sub-militaries of the United States, all in the Government of India are very busy in getting the people suffering from floods.
The nature of the people becomes very impaired by the flood.
Fruits, climates, reconstruction facilities, roads, electricity, information related structures are all affected.
Especially for the consequences of our cultivator brothers, as they enable the damage caused by the cultivation of farmers, we are sufficiently finishing solutions to the economy, co-ordination agencies, especially the production co-operation agencies.
At the same time, the 24-hour-hour help-productive 1078 has been fully operated to combine the flood.
People come to testify their problems in this idea.
Before the rainy season, most of the places have been trained, the surrounding government machines were also kept in the preservation.
The National Factory Meetboops were finished.
In many places, such activities have been carried out to create thorns in the campus, to do what they should not do, to determine themselves, to create a people, to act in such situations.
The technology has grown a lot, the space science is very important in describing it.
Because of this, we get almost the right computer.
Slowly, according to the climate's computer, to build our activities, to prevent the impact of the residents, we must change ourselves naturally.
Whenever I appreciate me for the voice program of the mind, then all the people of our country can see you engaged in their productive work.
This time skins and service taxes have received simple letters and phone calls.
Even now people are expressing their joy about this skin and service, demonstrating neighbours.
I'm calling this phone: Well, Chief, they're, I'm gonna talk to Kurgaon, that's from Gurugrom.
I've heard the daily talk of your calculators, it touched my mind.
Exactly a month ago, on this day, Serk and Services Tax, G.
S.
T.
It started.
In a month's extinction, are you supposed to be consequential
Thank you, I'd like to know your idea about it.
The skin and service taxes are only for one month, whose benefits are beginning to be known.
I'm very glad to write a letter to a labour that they're available at cheap prices.
In the north-east, in the remote mountainous regions, a dweller living in the forests, first G.
S.
T.
Don't know what it was, scared.
But now, after I learned, the work has become easy than before, it's glad to the letter that the business has become comfortable.
The biggest thing is, the prospectors have increased the confidence of traders.
I see how this new observation system has been affected in the area of transport and services.
How the traffic of the trucks has increased, how quickly it can be joined, I can see how the highways are locked up.
Due to the rapid increase in the trucks, the pollution decreases.
The objects also gather quickly.
In spite of this facility, it is gaining strength especially for economic rapidity.
Due to the first different jurisdiction, transport and service departments, most of the resources, records were spent in concurrence, new germinations were required to be held in every state.
I'm telling you that skin and service-good and simple taxes have actually made a very creative impact on our economic structure, at least time.
The speed at which simple changes have occurred, the speed in which the new books are recorded, all these have created a new hope in the entire country.
Surely economic experts, researchers, technological scientists and G. of India.
S.
T.
The process will be a predecessor in the world, and the research studies will be done.
In many world universities, it's a kind of study, too.
Because, in such a large quantity, such a big change, with the help of such a million people, it can be considered that this method is successfully absorbed in such a big country.
J.

T.
All the States have a share in absorbing G.
All the conclusions have been taken in the same way as the States connected to the Central Government.
As a result of this , the primary objective of every government is that this G.

That's why the harvest shouldn't cost much.
Just like that, j.

Everything is available in your mobile phone only after the new gathering, how much was the price of this dragon before the worker.
A country, enjoys the biggest dream of a வரி.

In the matter, I saw that all the government officials from Taluka to the first Central Government had worked hard, worked with evil feelings, made a big part in making a kind of popular environment between the government and the traders and the government.
I'm demonstrating my heartfelt life to all the ministers, all the departments, central and state governments involved in this work.

The most important example of the success of the social power of India is .
It's a historical success, historical achievement.
It's not just a tax reform, but a new, genuine culture has a powerful economy.
It's also a kind of social reform.
To my Kotanukodi folks, who have made such a big effort very naturally successful.
My folks, the month of August's revolution.
In fact, we've been questioning about this thing a little earlier, the reason for this was the operation of the Ordinance on the 1st day of August 1920.
Then on the 9th of August, 1942, the warrior began to exit, and we know it was the August Revolution.
Towards the end of 1974 AD the country became independent on 15th August .
In a way many events of August are specially linked to freedom history.
This year we're celebrating the 75th year of running out of white.
But the guy who drove this white out.
Some know that Yusuf Meher Ali is.
Our new headlines must know what happened on the 9th day of August, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, how many folk folks mixed themselves with freedom, bonded themselves, enjoyed gifts, all the historical aspects should be encouraged to confront the magnificent India.
What else can be the greatest prediction than our freedom fighters, penance, sacrifices
The most important struggle for the freedom movement of India is the exit of white.
This is the struggle to get rid of the British rule, to make the opposite nation strong.
At that time, against the British rule, every corner of Hindustan, villages, cities, studies, learners, poor, rich people, together with skins, opponents of British rule, participated in the war against the white.
The anger of the people was in the high court.
We also took the message of millions of folk or sweethearts to devote Gandhiji's rooms and carried forward the struggle in our heart.
Lacs of young people of the country have sacrificed their readings and books freely.
The confluence of freedom was sounded, they went ahead.
On 9th August , Gandhiji called for the exit of white drive, but all the big leaders of the country had been filled in the jails of British rule .
At that time, the second president, Da.
The main participants like Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayana have glittered.
In the year 1920 , the drive of white drives - both of them enjoy two different rocks of Gandhiji .
In 1942, the humility of the struggle was different, if the freedom of humour had increased in 1942, it was necessary to preserve a mantra like Gandhians, kar or slaves.
In the streets of all the successes, the support of the people was great, the skills of the people were enlightened, the spirit of the people's struggle was shining.
The whole country fought together.
Sometimes I'm sure...
..
The first freedom struggle of India took place in 1857.
The freedom struggle started in 1857 till 1942 has been continuously in any part of the country .
This long-term period was a free humor in the heart of the folks.
Everyone promised to do something.
The headlines changed, but there's no looseness in the mind.
People came continuously, engaged themselves, walked, and new people came, they joined themselves, British rule, pulled away, tried to compromise in the country.
From 1857 to 1942, this struggle was a new situation.
1942 brought this position to the supremacy.
Then the Sangnatha which came out of white was lying, had to leave the British in 5 years in 1974.
From 1857 to 1942, freedom fighters had reached everyone.
This 5 years since 1942 to 1947, this 5 years of people's emotions have been supposed to be supposed to be the cause of freedom of the country.
This 5 years you're determined.
Now I want to join you with this count.
We were free in 1974.
Today's in 2017.
It's just 70 years old.
The governments have arrived.
Organisations are cultivated, transformed, emerged, developed.
Everyone has tried to relieve the country from its problems.
Efforts have been made to increase the workplace in the country, to eradicate and develop.
Efforts were made on the paths.
Successes were also found.
The neighbours are also awake.
Likewise, the time from 1942 to 1947 is determined to succeed, the 5 years from 2017 to 2022, our psychological decisions will also be successful, we are waiting ahead.
This year, on the 15th of August, we have to celebrate the Sapdam, in the year 2022, we have reached 75 years of independence, and we have reached the success of this incident.
125 crore people of August 9, Revolution Day, on the 15th of this month of August, everybody will decide on the date of 15th, in the form of a person, in the form of a separate person - I will do this quantity for the country, in the form of a family, in the form of community, in the form of a society, in the form of a city, in the form of a government department, it will be decided to do it in the form of government.
Millions of people need the weekend.
Trying to meet the events that have been done.
Since then, however 5 years from 1942 to 1947 is the decisive years of the country's liberation, similarly this 5 years from 2017 to 2022, for the years of determining the future of India, we must unite it.
We've been celebrating after 5 years after the country's independence has been completed for 75 years.
That's what we all have to do with a sure ritual.
This year, 2017, we have to turn into the end of our commitment.
We have to integrate this August month's determination, show our dedication.
Come out of India , exit India , exit India , exit India , exit India , exit , exit India , exit India , pardon , exit India .
I don't want to do it tonight.
On the contrary, we're supposed to be associated with the determination of a new India.
You have to try all this, to work.
You have to live with this guarantee, work.
Come on, in the month of August, the 9th day of August will start the success of our conviction.
Every dweller, every social structure, architectural structure, school, college, and various structures, everybody to promote new India, to achieve some kind of obligation.
It's supposed to be our success in the next five years.
Young organisations, student organisations, government organisations can be arranged for public components.
Let's show new ideas.
What level should we join as a country
What can be my partner in it as a person
Come on, we'll join us every day with this guarantee.
I'd like to talk about the world of online today, especially my young friends, Sakaks.
Please advance all the techniques, guns, boasts, plagues, books, new thoughts, etc.
Come on, let's change this operation as a guy.
In the Narender Mody Activity, competition will be made for the younger social friends, leaving the white.
This is an attempt to compete with the warriors of the country, to know about the freedom fighters.
I hope you'll spread this message well, spread it.
I have the opportunity to talk to the country from the Red Fort on the 15th day of the month of August, as the Prime Minister of the country.
I'm an instrument.
There wasn't talk to a personal man.
In the bricket 125 crores of folk swings.
Trying to shape their dreams.
For the last three years of August, 15th of August, from all the places of the country, on the day of which I have to talk.
Even this way I'll invite you.
MyGov, if Narendra Modi acts, you must tell me your opinions.
I read them, on 15th August, I'll try to show them the day.
Last three times, I've kept a fugitive in front of me that the conversations on the 15th of August were long.
I think this time it's less to talk.
I'll finish more than 40-45-50 minutes.
I'm trying to regulate the rules for me.
I don't know if I can't.
But I've been thinking of trying this time to make my conversation a blind way.
Let's see if I'm winning or not.
Folks, I'd like to talk to you about another thing.
There is a social economy in the economic structure of India.
We should never imagine it less.
Our plans, keep ourselves, not just the joy of joy, pleasure.
Our plans and a movement for social restraint.
But at the same time, we have a direct connection with the economic life of every rigorous rigging.
After a few days Rakshabandan , Krishna Jayanti , then Girtha square , then Saut Chandra , then Ananta squarethasi , Durga Puja , Deepavali are coming together .
This is the only chance of earning money.
There is also a natural joy associated with the festivals.
Prohibitions are sweetness in relationships, sweetness in family, social brotherhood.
It connects individuals and groups.
The natural journey between these two continues.
Ah, sie, that's a chance that I'm moving from the status of the name.
As a financial condition, many months before Raksha Bandhan's wedding, many families start making racks like a small drunken business.
Several types of rocks are produced with dresses from the first corner .
But nowadays people are starting to like more rackies made at home.
Hundreds of people's business is linked to the designers, rackies, sweets, manufacturers.
The family members of our poor brothers are filled with this.
This isn't the only bright thrice we're on the day of Deepawati.
It's not that the house is decorating because of the wedding day.
It has a direct connection with the peculiar handicrafts that make small open lights.
But I'm supposed to talk about the economic conditions of the hard works related to these today, just as I'd like to explore the environment.
Sometimes I see the folks being more aware and creative than me.
For the last one month, aware citizens are writing letters to me regarding environment.
You're gonna talk about the kidnapped square before, and then I'm supposed to be planning from now on, the kidnapped in the soil.
I'm supposed to appreciate my grandfather to such a cautious citizen.
They're asking you to talk about it before the time.
This time there is a significance of socially male royalty .
Logmanya Bird Sanctuary Dilkar has produced this great tradition.
This year, the 125th year of social welfare.
125 years, 125 crore people - Logmanya Dilkar, organized for social harmony with any basic emotion, social awareness, social culture, social genius, competitor competitions, legislations, etc. can be reminiscent of the partition of Loganya Dilkar.
Keeping Dilkar's feelings black, in that direction, how can we advance the social genius.
We need to further strengthen this feeling.
Besides, we should be sure to create the triangles of the kids made of soil suitable for environmental protection.
This way I'm telling you very much.
I'm sure you all agree to join my opinion, so that you will be able to facilitate our evil artists, graceful architects of the pride, he has to get a job, and the stomach color of the labour.
Come on, let's all join the plans, join the economic conditions of the economy, enjoy the happiness of our traditional family, economic joy, this is our endeavor.
I'm supposed to all the folks, for various gatherings, for drilling, many lives of life.
We are constantly watching the folk, education sector, economic sector, social sector, sports sector - our women come to the country's mammals and take new peaks.
Our patriotic women are proud of us, glorify.
Our women, women's crickets, have been performing a miracle in the World Cup.
This week they've got the chance to meet everyone.
I'm very happy to communicate with them, but I realized that the weight that you couldn't succeed the world shield was pressing them.
They had this pressure on their faces, this shit.
I gave them a different comparison to those women.
Look, today's time is a communicable world, the negatives have become more, if they're growing, it turns into anger.
If the sportsmen of India were defeated, we've seen the anger of the country boiling on those sportsmen.
Some people, switch the snakes, write it, makes it more painful.
But for the first time, our women were unable to succeed in the World Cupboy, 125 million folks, that defeat was swimming on their shoulders.
Even the burden, those women didn't experience.
Don't stop with this, these women have praised the achievements that they produced.
I see it just a good change.
I told those ladies that you've only got a good deal like this.
I've told them that you're not going to be able to get rid of your mind.
If you succeed in the storm, even if you don't succeed, 125 crore people have won the minds.
In fact, the younger community of our country, especially women, are engaged in many matters of enjoyment of the country.
I'm once again, supposed to the younger community, especially for our women, my heart's admiration, living.
My countrymen, I once again recall the August Revolution, the 9th of August, the 15th of the month of August, once again on the year 2022, the seventeen years of independence.
Each dweller must ensure that a five-year activity must be fulfilled.
We have to take the country toward new peaks, carry them, carry them.
Come on, let's go join us, let's ride something.
The future of the country is certainly going to be special, let's go, move forward.
Heavy lives.
Thank you.
