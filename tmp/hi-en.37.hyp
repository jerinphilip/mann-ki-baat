Talking about the mind, January 2016, this is the first "mind" of my dear countrymen, 2016.
"The matter of mind has kept me with you such a obstacle, such a obstacle that any thing comes to light, if there is any idea, then there is a desire to tell among you."
Tomorrow I went to Rajghat to pay homage to Pooja Bapu.
This is a program to bow down to the martyrs every year.
At 11 o'clock, keeping silence for 2 minutes, there is an opportunity to express reverence for the people who sacrifice life for the country, for the great men who sacrifice life, for the brave men, for the stunning people.
But if we see, there are many of us who have not done this.
You do not think that this nature should be made, should we consider it as our national responsibility
I know it's not gonna happen to me with a "mind" thing.
But what I did yesterday, I thought I'd talk to you too.
And these are the things that inspire us to live for the country.
If you imagine, keep silence for 2 minutes every year at 11 o'clock on January 30 every year.
Can you imagine how big will this event be
And it is true that our scriptures have said, "Sangchchhdhwa Samvadva San Manasi Jantama - "We all walk together, speak together, our minds are one."
This is the true power of the nation and the work of giving life to this empowerment is done by such incidents.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I was reading Sardar Patel's ideas.
So I noticed some things and one of them liked me a lot.
Regarding Khadi, Sardar Patel has said that India's independence is in Khadi, the civilization of India is also in Khadi, which we believe in Hindustan, it is in non-violence Khadi and the farmers of India, for whom you show so much spirit, their welfare is also in Khadi.
Sardar Sahib was accustomed to speak directly in simple language and in a very good manner he described Khadi as an auspicious.
On January 30, I tried to reach the letter by writing a letter to the people connected to Khadi and Village Industries in the country on the date of worship of Bapu.
By the way, Bapu was a favorite of science, so I also used technology and tried to reach millions of such brothers through technology.
Khadi is now made a symbol, a different identity.
Now Khadi is becoming the center of attraction of the young generation and especially those who are inclined towards the Holistic Health Care and organic, have become an excellent solution for them.
Khadi has also made his place as a fashion and I congratulate people associated with Khadi that he has made a lot of effort to bring newness in Khadi.
The market has its own importance in the economy.
Khadi has also become compulsory to make space in the market as well as in the market.
When I told people that you have many types of abrics, then there should be a khadi too.
And people are embracing that yes, khadidhari can not be made, but if there are ten types of abrics, then one more.
But at the same time, my point is also flourishing a positive atmosphere in the government.
Many years ago, Khadi was used in the government.
But gradually, it all ended in the name of modernity and our poor people associated with Khadi became unemployed.
Khadi has the power to provide employment to millions of people.
In the past, Ministry of Railways, Police Department, Indian Navy, Post Office of Uttarakhand Many such government institutions have some good VIDEO to promote the use of Khadi
I have been nitified and I was told that as a result of this efforts of government departments, for the people working in the Khadi region, to fulfill this refreshment, to meet the needs of the government, additional HETRA - 18 lakh human days will be the employment generation.
18 lakh man-days, it will be a huge jump in itself.
Pooja Bapu was always very aware of the upgradation of Technology and was also urgent and only then our spinning wheels would have developed.
These days, running the spinning wheel using solar, connecting with solar energy charkha has been a very successful experiment.
Due to this, hard work has decreased, production has increased and quality quality change has also come.
Especially people send me a lot of letters for solar charkha.
Sadhana Devi of Geeta Devi, Komal Devi and Nawada district of Bihar from Dausa of Rajasthan has written to me and said that due to the solar charkha her life has changed a lot.
Our income has become double and the attraction towards our yarn is also increased.
All these things increase a new enthusiasm.
And on January 30, when I remember Bapu, I will repeat again - I must definitely have a khadi in all my many clothes, become its insistence.
Dear countrymen, the festival of January 26 celebrated with great enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
Between the concerns of the terrorists, what terrorists will do, the countrymen showed courage, encouraged and celebrated Prajasattak festival with honor.
But some people talked away and I would like to pay attention to these things, especially Haryana and Gujarat, two states made a big extraordinary experiment.
This year, to demolish the government school in every village, he liked the most educated daughter of that village.
Haryana and Gujarat gave importance to daughter.
The read-written daughter gave special honor.
"Beti Bachao-Beti Teach - He tried to give a good message of it.
I congratulate this imagination power of both the states and congratulate all those daughters who have the opportunity to flag, flag hoist.
In Haryana, it was even more talked that in the last one year in which the daughter was born, such families were invited specially on January 26 and placed them in the first line as VIP.
This was a moment of great pride in itself and I am happy that I started my "Beti Bachao-Beti Teacho Abhiyan" from Haryana, because there was a lot of disturbance in Se-ratio in Haryana.
The number of daughters born in front of a thousand sons was very low.
There was great concern, social balance was in danger.
And when I liked Haryana, then my officials had said that no-sir, do not do there, there is a big negative atmosphere.
But I worked and I congratulate Haryana today that he made this matter his point and today the number of daughters is increasing rapidly.
I really congratulate for the change in social life there.
Last time I had said two things in "Mann".
One, as a citizen, why don't we clean the status of great men
To settue, we are big emotional, but later we are careless.
And the second thing I had said, there is a Prajasattak festival, then how do we emphasize duty, how to discuss duty
The discussion of rights has happened very much and will continue, but the duties should also be discussed.
I am happy that citizens came forward in many places of the country, social institutions came forward, educational institutions came forward, some saints and mahatma came forward and all of them are somewhere where these statue are, statues are, Safai of him, Safai of the premises.
There has been a good start, and this is not just a cleanliness campaign, it is also a respected campaign.
I'm not mentioning everyone, but the news that has been received is very satisfactory.
Some people don't hesitate to report.
I'm urging them most. Send photos of the statue you've evacuated on MyGov portal.
People of the world look at him and feel proud.
In the same way, on January 26, duty and authority - I had asked people's ideas and I am happy that thousands of people took part in it.
My dear countrymen, I need your help for a job and I believe you will help me.
In our country, a lot is said in the name of farmers, a lot is said.
Well, I don't want to get involved in that dispute.
But the farmer is one of the biggest crisis, his entire hard work goes to the water in natural calamity.
His year is wasted.
The only way to protect him is in mind and that is the Fasal Insurance Scheme.
In 2016, the Government of India has given a huge gift to farmers - "Prime Minister Fasal Insurance Scheme".
But this plan is praised, be apparent, the Prime Minister will get congratulations, not for this.
Fasal insurance is being discussed for so many years, but more than 20-25 percent of the country's farmers have not been able to become its beneficiary, they have not been able to connect with it.
Can we resolve that in the coming year, at least 50 percent of the country's farmers can be linked to crop insurance
Just, I need your help in this.
Because if he joins the crop insurance, then there is a huge help at the time of crisis.
And this time, "Prime Minister Fasal Insurance Scheme" has got so much public approval, because it has been made so comprehensive, so simplifying, so technology II
I've brought nput.
Not only that, even after cutting the crop, if something happens in 15 days, then also assured help.
Using technology, how fast its speed, not delay in getting insurance money - all these things have been taken into account.
The biggest thing is that the rate of premium of crop insurance has been made so low, it has been done so much below, which may not have anyone thought.
In the new insurance scheme, the maximum limit of premium for farmers will be two percent for Kharif's crop and one and a half percent for Rabi's crop.
Now tell me, if my farmer brother is deprived of this, will it be harmed or not
You will not be a farmer, but listen to my mind.
Will you reach me to the farmers
And so I want you to propagate it more.
This time I have brought a new plan for you too.
I want my "Prime Minister Fasal Insurance Scheme" to reach this point.
And it is true that you listen to my "mind" on the radio, on T.V.
But what if you have to listen later
Now I'm going to give you a new gift.
Can you hear my "mind" on your mobile phone and can hear it anytime.
You just have to do that. Just make a missed call from your mobile phone.
"The number of mobile phones has been fixed for the matter" 8190881908. Eight one nine zero eight, eight one nine zero eight.
If you missed call, then you'll ever hear about "Man."
At present, it is in Hindi, but very soon you will get an opportunity to listen to "mind" in your mother tongue too.
My management continues for this too.
My dear young men, you wondered.
When the start-up program took place on January 16, I experienced new energy, new consciousness, new enthusiasm and new enthusiasm in the youth of all over the country.
In millions of people, people registrated to come to that program.
But due to not having such a place, finally this program was done in Vigyan Bhawan.
You couldn't reach, but you've been partnering it all the time on-line.
Perhaps a program has been kept by millions of youth for so many hours and it is very rare, but it happened.
And I was seeing what's the excitement of start-up.
And but one thing, which is the general people's thinking that start-up means I
.T. Relayed things, very sophisticated business.
This confusion broke after this event of start-up.
I
Start-up around .T. is a small part.
Life is huge, requirements are infinite.
Start-up also comes with countless opportunities.
I just went to Sikkim a few days ago.
Sikkim has now become the organic state of the country and I invited agricultural ministers and agricultural secretaries across the country.
I got a chance to meet two young men there
I
Anurag Agarwal and others are Siddhi Karnani.
They walked towards start-up and they got me in Sikkim.
They work in North-Ast, work in agriculture and are herbal yields, organic yields, global marketing it.
This did not happen
Last time I told people associated with my start-up that send your experiences to "Narendra Mody App."
Many sent, but more will come, I'll be happy.
But those who have come, they are really inspirational.
There is a young man by belief Dwivedi, he has done on-line kitchen start-up and those middle-class people who have come for livelihood, they work to reach Tiffin through on-line networking.
There is a Mr Dignesh Pathak, he has decided to work on animal food for farmers and especially animals, Animal Feed.
If our country's animals, they will get good diet, then we will get good milk, we will get good milk, then our country will be young.
Manoj Gilda, Nikhil ji, he started the start-up of agri-storeage.
They are doing bulk storage system develop for agricultural products with scientific ruits storeage system.
That is, a lot of suggestions have come.
Send you more, I'll feel good and I'll have to talk about start-up again and again, just like I talk about cleanliness every time, start-up, because your philanthrop, this is our inspiration.
My dear countrymen, cleanliness is now also joining beauty.
For many years, we kept expressing anger against dirt, but the dirt did not go away.
Now the countrymen have started discussing cleanliness and cleanliness work is going on somewhere, some things are going on.
But now one step citizen has moved forward in it.
He has added beauty to cleanliness.
In a way gold is pleasant and specially looking at railway stations.
I am seeing that these days local citizens, local artists, students of many railway stations of the country are engaged in decorating their own railway station.
Keeping local art in the center, keeping the wall paintings, making sign-board well, making artistic, making people aware, not know what are they doing
Someone told me that tribal women at Hazaribagh station have punished the entire railway station with the design of local Sohrai and Kohbar Art there.
More than 300 volunteers of Thane district decorated King Circle Station, Matunga, Borivali, Khar.
There are also many news from Rajasthan, Sawai Madhopur, Kota.
It seems that our railway station will automatically become the identity of our traditions.
Everyone will no longer find the lorry of tea and wood from the window, sitting on the train and sitting on the wall will see what is the specialty here.
And it ' s not the railway ID
Unitiative was Narendra Modi's UI
was nitiative.
It belonged to citizens.
See the citizens, how do they do
But I see that I have got some pictures, but I think I'll see more pictures.
Can you send me, who have made some effort to beauty at the railway station or somewhere else with cleanliness
Send it sure.
I will see, people will also see and others will also get inspiration.
And what can happen at the railway station, it can be at the bus station, it can be in the hospital, it can be in the school, around the temples, can be around the churches, around the mosques, can be in the garden and garden, how much can it be
Those who came to this idea and who started it and who carried forward, are all congratulations officers.
But yes, you must send me photos, I want to see, what have you done
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for themselves that India is hosting very big from 4th to 8th of the first week of February.
The whole world is coming to our guests and our navy is preparing for this hosting.
Warships of many countries of the world, naval ships, Andhra Pradesh's Visakhapatnam are gathering on the beach.
I
International Let Review is happening on the beach of India.
There is an attempt to coordinate between the world's military power and our military power.
is a joint eercise.
It's a big opportunity.
In the coming days, you are going to get information from TV media because it is a big program and everyone emphasizes it.
This is very important for a country like India and India's maritime history has been golden.
In Sanskrit, the sea is called the source or ocean.
This means infinite abundance.
The boundaries separate us, the earth separates us, but the water adds us, the sea adds us.
We can add ourselves to the sea, connect with anyone.
And our ancestors had introduced this power by traveling the world centuries ago, doing world trade.
Whether Chhatrapati Shivaji, whether Chola Empire - He made a new identity about maritime power.
Even today, there are many states where many traditions related to the sea are alive, celebrate as a festival.
When the world is becoming a guest of India, the power of the Navy is being introduced.
It's a good opportunity.
I will also get the privilege to be present on this global occasion.
In the eastern end of India, sports ceremony is being held in Guwahati, SAARC countries sports ceremony.
Thousands of SAARC countries are coming to Guwahati's land.
The atmosphere of the game, the excitement of the game
A grand festival of the new generation of SAARC countries is happening on the soil of Guwahati in Assam.
This is also a good opportunity to connect with SAARC countries in itself.
My dear countrymen, I had already said that whatever comes in the mind, I wish, openly share it with you.
There will be tenth and twelfth examinations in the coming days.
Last time, in the matter of "mind", I had talked to the students about the examination.
This time I wish that the students who have succeeded and have passed on the day of the stress free examination, what was the atmosphere in the family, the Gurujans, what did the teachers do, what did they try, what did the senior told them and what
You will have good experiences.
This time we can do such a thing that you send me your experience to the Narendra Modi app.
And I will also pray to the media, whatever good things are in it, they will propagate through their media in the coming February month, so that the students across the country will read it, T.V. and they will also see how to worry free, how to stress free, how to laugh, its hereditary hand will be taken and I am sure that the media friend will help in this work.
Yeah, but then you'll send everything.
Will you send it
Send sure.
Thank you very much, buddy.
Then once you'll get the next month for the next "mind" thing.
Thank you very much.
