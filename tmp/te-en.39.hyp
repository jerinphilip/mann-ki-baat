In the Akashwani, Minister of State, Shri Narendra Modi, 'Man Ki Bath' (Speak in Mansu) programme is the television of the whole episode.
11.
2015) Deepavali Pavitra Pilgrimage, you will have wonderfully spent the holidays.
The new business activity is also funny.
On the other side - arrangements for Christmas festival are also started.
Festival is so important in social life.
Once the festival is used to absorb the wounds.
Gives a new power once.
But.
Once upon a festival, it's a bit painful to face difficulties.
And it's a little bit harder.
From everywhere in the province the news of nature is coming.
Nevertheless, there are reports of nature viperitols in the style of Kanivini Light.
The effect of environmental changes is so rapid that the poison becomes probable when it rises.
The most lucky, untimely bulls, roarless species, below a few days in Man's country.
First of all, the effects of these years have fallen even on these states.
So many died.
I'm telling my greatest feelings to the families of those who died in this hardship.
The kingdoms are embarrassed with all the powers in the welfare, rehabilitation work.
The Centre never breaks the shoulders of the shoulders.
The Centre's Progress team went to a triumph.
There is faith in the Shakti of Tamil Nadu.
I've faced so much disaster.
It's going back to the front, and in the country's hell, it's a salvation of the possessor.
But seeing such disasters all around, it's likely to make changes in the matter of combating them.
Below the day, the nature was wicked, that's the same business department.
Because.
In the opposite, the nature of the most of the survivors were familiar with the business.
But now the disaster has turned over.
It is inevitable to work to increase the human capacity at the level of Prati.
Lordship, civilization, publicity, small and big organizations are in a row with the enhancement of power with so much deeper scientific vision.
I spoke to Mr. Navaz Sharif on the eve of the earthquake coming in Nepal.
SARC countries have suggested combinations to meet the disasters.
I'm glad to pursue the excellent methods of dealing with the disasters by defying a civilization of SARC countries in Delhi.
This day I received a phone from Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab.
'I am Lachwinder Singh.
Talking to Punjab district of Jalandhar.
We'll make a secondary business right here.
I'll give you a lot of money to the crops.
I have a doubt.
Farmers suppose the woods to kick the crops.
How should they say what kind of adverse effects the sort of microbes in the earth that hurt the wheat bacteria.
In Delhi, in Haryana, what is this pollution in Punjab
'Call that phone.
Lakhwinder Singh.
I was very happy to hear your words.
I'm glad to know you're a central business farmer.
Second.
You're thinking about the problems of farmers on the other side of your own central business.
Your appreciation is compassionate.
But this meeting is not in Punjab, not in Haryana.
It's the habit of man in the entire weighted country.
In this way, the crops are funny, recommending the way to burn these ruins.
I don't know what it's gonna be.
Everyone's gonna come kissing cobbles.
This was the habit.
Second - it doesn't have any punishment to know what it means.
It's bought like this.
This method has grown like that.
This burning ceremony has also happened to the conclusion of the present environmental changes.
Now it's listening to the surroundings of this communion.
But, it's very true to the applicant that you've distracted now.
On this, the peasants of Soddar Sodriman should be supposed to be observed.
It's a little bit bit of burning the woods of crops at the first time of this funeral.
It's okay.
Tarvati is not ready to wear the crop.
But.
It's not a waste.
The ruins of crops are also very important.
Tell the arbitrariness to the farmers only if they have the quality of using them.
When the man burns them, we're destroying that qualities.
Not that much.
The cattle eat like dry fruits by making them pieces of pieces.
The second - they'll be burnt on the ground after burning.
My favourite farmer Sodri Sodra.
Think a moment.
Like the brain bones are stiff.
Like the heart is strong.
The urine pimples are fine.
Everything's good to be on the sheriff and get burnt.
What happens.
Listen to me.
Don't even touch the heart.
It's not the only way to survive if you're alive, as well as to ruin the remains of the crops.
It also burns.
When the earth burns, the liquid land also turns to death.
That's why it's a good job to do this thing.
If these ruins are supplied on the ground, they will be used as a central body.
Or even if the skull water goes out of the gourd, it turns into a good central body.
It's how it comes to eating cattle.
It's also good on the ground.
Anyone who's putting on that floor gets double procedure.
Once the peasant of Artisag came to talk to the guys.
They told me about a good experience.
When the Art was swimming, it wasn't the cultivation, but the Art bonds were left.
Five-wheelers, five-wheelers, thousands of rupees per day for each hectares to destroy that land.
If you get the trekkers full of tractors to wear those shits, you're not gonna get that fucking piece of shit.
In such a situation, some farmers make sure what they're doing... they're supposed to put the fingers in the ground.
The feeling is, how many waters are in this dark bundle - they don't have trees, plants, crops for three months.
The water in that slaughtered half-slaughtered piece of slaughter, the smelling of the plants of Ganny.
Now there's also the option of these Art Bodels.
Those plants also get life.
I'm sorry to clean that piece up in front.
Now it's the option of those guys.
Small uses don't give much benefit to any scientists.
My country's favourite descendants, the Disabled Disabled 3 is not going to be the whole of the destination of the international artisans.
That's all I'm talking to you on the original donation in Man Ki Bath.
I'm also talking about the noto-help line for original donation.
The number of phone calls was seven times higher than that's Man Ki Bath Tarawat.
Spirits increased by two and a half percent in the website.
On the 27th anniversary of November 27, we took the day of donation.
The four fronts of the Samjaz are involved in it.
The film Ravina Tandon has supplied so many fronts in it.
It saves many invaluable lives.
Obvious donation takes a unique immortality.
The body gets new jamming from a body to the body.
That person gets a new life.
There's only a greater donation.
There are so many patients waiting for the original change.
A registry business at the national level related to original transformation began on 27th this month.
Logo related to Noto, Donor Card, put a national level competition in Mague Dot In to design slogan.
I'm surprised if you see how many people participated in the elevator and spoke in a unique manner.
I believe in the widespread consciousness of this matter, the arbitrarily embarrassing of the orthodoxies.
No one don't donate.
How do they get comfort
That's how I said I'm gonna be born on December 3rd Vicklangs.
The physical, the mansic wisdoms are also incompetent courage, potential components.
Sometimes somebody gets a lot of trouble when he's screaming them.
It's very good to hear the words of Karuna, Dayapur.
But if they change their vision, they'll get rid of them.
If you get a little bit of trouble, you'll sit down.
I'm supposed to hurt a little bit of vallet.
Well let's live.
How are you drunk.
I don't think it's too hard to think that.
So the wicked man gets smiling.
Their hypocrisy, their vision seems to be compassionate with their lifestyle.
I want to tell you about Javed Ahmed this day.
He's got 40-42 slices.
In 1996, the agitators were burnt on Jawed Ahmed in Kashmir.
They're supposed to be supposed to kill Gani.
But the urine was lost because of the angels.
Digestion, some part of the intestine has gone.
He was seriously injured.
The power of standing on your own legs has become powerful.
Yet Javed Ahmed didn't agree.
The wound of gratitude also did not hurt Javed Man Styre.
Thank you.
That's the biggest thing he's gonna have to face such a silly tragedy.
The main part of life has fallen into the miracle.
But there's no bang at all.
Don't panic.
Javed Ahmd changed this suffering as a circumstance and offered his life to serve Sammaz.
Don't take care of the body.
But 20 slaves were drowned in telling the child malfunction.
How to slow down the mathematics for organisms.
How to make arrangements for wicked people in foreign affairs, civil works.
I'm squeezing on food.
In this case, he bought his poor man.
He took Master's degree in social service.
As a social service, becomes an unprecedented citizen, a dull to the witch.
A quiet disappearing.
Javed's life doesn't mean to inspire the original origin of India.
Javed reminds the life of Ahmd, the penance of immortality, and the impression of Disabber 3.
I'm talking about Javed's pills due to harmony.
But there's only such inspiration lights all over the country.
There are new lights to live.
It's showing way.
Remembering such beautifulness on December 3, there is a need to get rid of them.
The country of Man is so big that many republics are going on.
They depend on the human beings.
Maybe it's a man of mind.
I'm gonna want to be in the middle of the lower.
You can't be poor.
Commitments.
The victims.
I'm gonna need furniture.
There's a constant relationship with the possibilities.
And sometimes in a man's life, he can't be able to do with a governor.
That one doesn't suppose he doesn't have the supremacy of the privilege.
There's some architecture in it.
But at once, in this premierity business, the people of Laksh are serving so excellently with the numerous feelings of service.
Those people can't come to mind.
It's enough time to know who's doing such a good job in the prestige of the privilege.
There's hopeful work in Man's country.
The nation has their network work.
I don't hear the church related to the minds of the people of the country.
You don't even listen.
But the famous Bill Gates Foundation of the Proprietor's business family is a pride of profit.
Bill gates, Milinda Gates, together with the padmabhushan Puraskara.
They're having many social services in the country.
They're pursuing what they've earned for the rest of life for the poor.
Sometimes.
Calcina, how smokes the opportunists who are supposed to get rid of any possibilities, so much the optimistic wickers will squeeze.
They say all these are so excited to learn new things.
A few days ago, the kingdom of the kingdom became a guerrilla of hopeful activity.
Tindagaon is a small village in Odisha Balasore district.
This hopeful activity, and no more jinabas than Girija.
Let's get the schedule all week.
Damn it.
Besides, that place is malaria disturbed.
The hopeful worker decided to execute Manim Singh Evernie Maleria.
Going around the house, knowing a little bit of a fever, reaching the skull with you.
The person who had taken care of him in the past, washed up the worms in his house, slaughtered his own kids surely to sleep.
And throughout the village of Jamama Mani Singh came with the rest of the mosquitoes.
That's how malaria was faced.
The young man of that village also set him up on his way.
How many such people, Jamuna are bulls.
How many lacs are there around the man.
Look at them a little bit hungry.
Those who are great compassions of the country of Man.
The communications are swords to share happiness.
I appreciate the optimistic activity in the form of a common man.
My young friend, dear.
Internet, I put three e-books in the mag-site for my young friends who were very active in social media.
E-books related to the immense villages, and all about the healthcare, for the sufficient architects of a clean heavy work.
I'm asking you to see them.
Look.
Show them all.
Good luck.
And even if possible, we can add new things.
Please send me to Magave.
I don't care how it's like.
But for the sake, it makes a lot of balls.
Sanukul's power is the biggest household.
Share you about good congressmen too.
Share these e-books.
Please roll on e-paste.
Tell the students of 8, 9, 10, about the E-books that are excited young people.
That's what happened up there.
It happened right here.
Tell me that.
Then you'll be real social teachers.
Get yourself in the formation of the country.
That's why I'm calling you.
My dear patriot, Yawat Prapanch, is worrying about the changes of the atmosphere.
Change of the atmosphere, on the Earth's surface, it's roaming around.
There's too much annoyance.
Before praying, it's getting immense as a measure now.
Don't raise the Earth.
It's one of Prati's careful.
That's the best idea.
It's the most important way to protect the earthquake.
That's the household.
Disabled the 14th anniversary of the National Interview.
In relation to this, there are many legends in the hands of the prince.
El in it.
E.
D.
Blub bathak is one.
Nowadays, I told you that all the walls of the narrow nerve should be dressed and enjoyed silver silver silver silver silver for an hour.
Someone saw a friend sent me a link.
I got the chance to see it.
Now that thing has been told to tell you too.
But this incident only sticks to Jee News.
Because it's Cabbitty of Link ji News.
There is a hill named Noor Jahan of Kanpur .
I don't know she's supposed to die in TV.
But, she doesn't even think of anyone who's doing it.
By listening to the sunshine with solar power, it's a drizzling piece of digestion.
Fighting on the dark.
Built a mahila mandir and started the tairy of lightning with the solar power.
And a lanter is paying a hundred rupees on rent in a month.
She takes Lanter to smile in the evening.
On the very dawn, they're gonna give Lanter to charging.
Nearly 500 households at a height, they heard her walking around, taking the lanterns.
It's about three-four rupees a day.
But it'll be all over here.
But this is Nur Jahan's supposed to recharging the lantern with that solar power all day.
Look now.
What do they do all the big ones in the province for the transformation of the atmosphere.
But one of these niece Jahan Prati is sparkling each other.
Don't do the same thing.
Nur Jahan's the whole thing to do.
She's roaming the light through this pin.
I appreciate Nur Jahan.
G TV is also appreciating.
Because in Kanpur, this root of a root has been shown to the country, for the whole treasure.
A lot of appreciations.
Mr. Abhishek Kumar Ponde has called me from Uttarpradesh.
'Yes Namaskara.
I'm talking to Abhishek Kumar Pandey from Gorakhpur.
I'm supposed to say a lot of respect for Prathana Marri.
Because.
Started an activity called Mudra Bank.
We're gonna learn from Prathana Mantri.
How will you embarrass our industrialists in this mudra bank.
How dare you get us '
It's called.
Abhishek.
Thank you.
He sent me a message from Gorakhpur.
Prathana matri Mudra resists the immortals.
It's impressionable to those who don't keep them.
Three 'E' to say the purpose is halfway.
Anter Price, Ernning, Emperorment.
Mudra provokes the Atsakhika Parisram.
Calpis is the emergence of the mudra.
Mudra empowers the real understanding.
This muddum is supposed to communicate for small businessmen.
The faster the jerks have to steal that speed.
But, the beginning was well done.
In such a short period approximately 66 lakh people have been given Rs 42 thousand crore from Pradhana Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Let's go but the fucker.
But the fucking guy.
But let's sell the news tricks.
But let's make the slaves.
Small businesses.
I'm still happy to have about 24 lakhs of women in these 66 lakhs.
The SC, ST, OBC, Vargas are in great numbers among those who have received this comfort.
Striking yourselves, you used to pursue the family at the top of your feet.
Abhishek himself said about his excitement.
My skin also has lots of news.
In Mumbai, Schlesh Bhonsley's personality has been told by nobody.
Eight and a half lakh rupees from the bank have been given by the mudra yojana.
Gradually started the business of cleaning the furnaces.
I'm talking about this at my self-respect.
I told you that the Italian industrialists, clean Abhiyan.
Shelesh Bhonsley showed it up.
Let's bring a tanker.
You're buying this puzzle with me.
In a few days, I also told me that two lakh rupees were paid back to the bank.
The purpose of our muddle is also to say the same.
In the matter of Mata Sharma of Bhopal, she has received 40 thousand rupees from Pradhana Mantri Modray.
She's punching punctures.
That's why she used to bury more daddy in the past.
Very hard businessmen.
Now she's making her drink better because she's dumping her hand in the bigger ones.
Because of a foolless reason, it's been a lot of reasons for her.
Now the taste provided by the bank is more than fifty rupees in the month of the first month.
A good business for their family is gradually deteriorating.
But, I'm asking for a further propaganda for this story.
The banks of the bank should be compassionate, honest.
Most of the small businessmen must comfort them as possible.
In fact, the country's financial business is supposed to be heroes.
It's the junk of making small pieces that make the country economically powerful.
We're gonna give them a call.
Good damn shit.
But it'll be better.
Lovely my country, October, I appreciate about the 31-year-old patel narrator's weight-breaking weight.
In some matters there must be absurdity in the social life.
'Rashtraya, Jagrayam, Vohm' is free from the unprecedented civilization.
The narrow root, the weight.
The best weight seems to give it a different form.
I'd like to inform you on the migo.
How to build work.
That's what happened.
How to raise the part of the public.
How to be its form.
I want to give all this information.
I told you the instructions are coming.
But I'm supposed to get more instructions.
I'm asking for a spectacular reading.
I told those who participated in it to get certificates.
The big buffaloes also got to show something.
You also use your creative power.
Uncle, all this spell called unconscious.
A weight, a great weight mantra.
How can one beat the heavier
What kind of thing should be.
How to work.
Be sure.
Gourav must be in touch.
Life must be filled.
Prati must be very compassionate, simple to kill one of them.
What do the governor do.
Prosecute.
What to do with the family.
You can say a lot of things.
I'm supposed to come up with your instructions.
Lovely my son, Sodrimnulara, is getting cold.
It's so good to eat in the cold.
Fucking clothes is also funny.
But, listen to me.
Exercise.
To keep the body healthy, do so much exercise in winters, yoga.
Even in the family, let's get that ventilation.
Kalsi does the same for an hour, it'll be the festival in the family.
Look at you.
Any kind of consciousness comes.
How dare you take the body all day.
That's why you have a good habit in good taste.
My salutations again for all my dwellers, dear.
Jehind.
