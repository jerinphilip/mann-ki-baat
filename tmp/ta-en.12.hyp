The voice of the heart is February 2018, the people of the country, silly.
I'm starting with a phone call today.
He's the prime minister, I'm speaking from Mirrat to Gomal Tribadi...
28th National Science Day...
..
India's progress and its growth are linked to science...
.
Whatever tests and renovations we make in this area, that amount of our progress will be quick, we can also work out...
Can our young men speak some words as they enjoy a scientific idea
With their ideas expanded, the progress of the country was also confirmed...
Thank you.
Thank you for your phone call.
My young friends have asked me about the arduous snakes of science, some have written letters.
We all know that the color of the sea is blue, we don't have any color for water because of our daily experience.
Do we ever imagine why the water seemed to be colored by the river and the sea
This question was raised in 1920 a young man's mind.
This question has created a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about modern science, Bharat Ratna Sir.
C.
V.
Ram's name comes first to us.
He's got a novel prize on the light scattering that's the most exciting activity.
His study is precious in the name of Ramn's effect.
Every year we celebrate the 28th day of the month of February on National Science Day.
Because, this is the day he's done research on the light.
That's why he was honored with a novel gift.
Many great scientists have been born in our country.
On the other hand, there has been a great tradition of friends like Pothayan, Paskarcharya, Brahmagupdar, Aryapathar, and on the other hand, Shushrudar, Sarkar etc. have made us proud.
Sir.
Scientists like Jagadish Chandra Bose , Harkovind Kurana etc . started becoming the greatest of India .
The name of Satyendranath Bose was given to the famous architects, which is known as Boseon.
A few days ago, the Artificial Intelligence of Wadhwani Institute in Mumbai had to participate in the program that started the artificial microscope organization.
It's very comfortable to know about the surprising scientific fields.
These artificial microscopes are found to create ropos, boots, specific activity machines.
Today the machines go through machines and make your fine, and sharp.
These techniques can be used to make the lives of drunken people more important.
In this program related to artificial microscope, scientists have been asked to make the life of the changing sisters more comfortable, how this artificial microscope can be helpful.
Can you know more specially about the presence of natural bushes through artificial microscopes
Can you help the farmers' consequences
Can this artificial microscope be easily accessible to health services , be helpful in identifying diseases through modern methods
A few days ago, I went with the Prime Minister of Israel to start the I Create Plan in Ahmedabad of Gujarat.
There was a young man, designed a digital tool.
Those who are unable to speak through this instrument, the instrument changes it, the young man does it like talking to one of them.
I think in such types we can use artificial microscope.
Scientific and technology is valuable.
It doesn't mean it's self-esteem.
Any machine that works as we like.
But the machine depends on us what we're doing.
We believe that human purpose is important in this place.
We have to use the very high peaks of human life for the human social welfare of science.
Thomas Alva Edition, found out the light pulp, had lost his many tests.
Once he heard about it, he said, "I've discovered ten thousand strategies of how I can't make the Light Bulb."
That's why Edition has changed his failings to his failings.
I don't even have an activity, but I don't know that today, Maurishi is in Aravind's sacred arrow.
As a revolutionary, he fought against the British economies, he raised many whips against the rule.
In the form of a great rishi, he raised up a wind against every corner of life.
Their stairs were also designed, pushing the path to human society.
Clear to know the truth, the feeling of raising questions again is important.
It's also the thrilling prediction behind the scientific discovery.
Why, why, don't you have to live until the questions don't know.
I live my life for all of our scientists, science related to national scientific day.
Our younger society, the truth, the knowledge, and the enjoyment of social service with the help of science, for which I have fifteen thousand lives.
I have colors of many times involving sophisticated messages about lives, lives, habituals, fascists, people write something about them.
Ravindra singh of Pune has written about the Occupational Safety in Narendramodi App, that's industrial security.
In our country, the security levels in the factory, the instrumental works are not important.
On the 4th day of the month of March, the next day, the National Security Day should be addressed by the Prime Minister in his mind's voice, through which the awareness of the security will be in mind.
If we talk about civil protection then two things are very important - one is precautionary , otherwise staying in a state of precaution .
Safety is two types, one is important in the neighborhood, otherwise it is essential in daily life.
It's hard to say that we are not aware of the security in our daily life, not safe, in the neighborhood, this situation is eight.
Many times we read the behaviour written on the streets.
What's written in them - uickness was over, accident, loss of a mistake, loss of happiness, foolishness.
Don't hate this fast life, don't repeat the protective relationship.
Don't play safely, otherwise life will become psychological.
It does not usually have any benefits in our life due to these obligations.
Looking at the departure of natural beds, most of our places are the result of something wrong.
If we wake up, we follow the necessary methods, we can save our community from the biggest places that we can save our lives.
Many times we might have seen writing a number of obligations regarding security in our works, but we've seen that they're not following the balance.
I'm asking that the municipal corporations are the dragonists, they should be trained in schools once a week or a month.
By this two advantages - one adventurous training will be done to the terrorists, the next, the new telephones will also be able to know this, but they will not be able to spend a lot of money.
Somehow it ends in education, whenever I've been listening to this thing.
We must abrogate that India's geographical and sea-constituent country is a geographically integral.
There are many natural residents in this country, we will also be the residents produced by experienced chemicals and industrialists.
Today, the National Facility Reservation Bureau (NDMA) is headed by the country's residential settlement.
The National Factory Reservation in Meetboop functions is swiftly reaching the face of rain, flooding, warming, rainforesting, rainforesting, various types of bushes.
Guides have also been made for this, as well as continuous training is being done for competence.
In the districts of the floods, the dangers of the floods have been trained by their own thrones, named as dangerous people.
Till 2-3 years ago, because of the heat wave, thousands of people were surviving.
After this, the National Factory Reservation Museum organized the training grounds to be protected from this heat wave and carried out awareness amongst the people.
The Wanney Centre was also warning the right.
Everyone has a good effect on the partition.
In the year 2017, the number of deaths occurring due to the heat wave attacks decreased by the number of just 220.
If we predict protection, we'll be safe.
I would like to appreciate everybody who is busy and sneezing in the society - social organisations , citizens of awareness - at any place where the buses are there .
Our complicated and metabolic services, the National Faster, immediately operated, armed, sub-military army personnel, associations and components are helping people don't get their money.
National students like sermons, architects and architects are now working in these works, their training is also being given to them.
An attempt was made in the past.
Like the coordinated military exercises of the world's countries, it was thought that all countries should not have comprehensive exercises related to coordination.
In its operation, the Government of India conducted a co-ordinated busier securities training in the Union of India, India, Myanmar, Myanmar, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal, which is an activity of mankind.
We have to change the society with cautiousness against danger.
In our tradition, we will repeatedly talk about the safety of the fat, but in the same way we will be aware of the safety furnaces.
We have to make it as part of our life.
We've been airplane several times, the airplane in the airplane provides safety tips at the beginning.
If we ask them for several methods, where are security related things, anybody in us today, can we answer correctly
Where is life jacket, life jacket
How to use it
Look at that.
I'm sure none of us can give them the wheels properly.
Well, was there a way to report
Was it.
Did everyone have the chance to see it directly
Could.
But we didn't record it in our mind.
Why
Because, we don't really wake up, after we sit in the plane, our ears hear something, but nobody's talking about this information about me.
This is how every aspect of life has our experience.
Nobody else should be protected.
If we're aware of our security, we'll fill our feelings about social security.
My folks, this time in the Report of Region, under the Sanitation of India, have been given the importance of traveling through natural climates in villages, energy generation etc.
GOBAR-Dhan-Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources, that is, the name of separation of vital bases.
The purpose of cleaning the villages, salvation of legs, plantations of trees, fabrication and change of natural burning, by which it is to make salvation and concentration by this Cooperation activity.
Our country is very much in the world.
The number of parenthes in our country is only 30 crores, only 30 lakh டன்s for the second day of San production.
Some European countries, China, the salts of legs, lifestyle, etc. are used for the production of firepower.
But India didn't work fully in this area.
Under the rural programme of sacred India campaign, we are now looking forward to this direction.
It has been decided to enhance the production of natural artificial power through synthetics, peasants, minerals.
Under the Cooper-Dan project, the farmers, brothers and sisters of India have been encouraged, and they should not only see Sanna and potatoes for a long time.
With this Cooper-Dan plan the rural people will get immense opportunities.
It will be helpful to keep the villages clean.
Increasing the benefits of carving, the products are open.
And cook this natural burning, enhance the surgeon, helpfully.
For the farmers, the wealth of the cultivation and the wealth will increase.
There will be possibilities of new workplaces in reservoirs, transportation, natural fuel sales.
Cooper-than plans will be implemented in a comprehensive manner.
By combining farmers with treasury, it will make the right price for the farmers' yield.
Professionalists, especially in the neighborhood of the country, want to go ahead.
The self-sufficient groups, organized a combination, fully use this opportunity.
I'm inviting you to participate in this pure burning and greening activity.
Change the toilets in your villages, move from San to the direction of copper-tan.
My favorite folks, we've been questioning all about some kind of fairs that we've been celebrating, festivities, film festivals till now.
But in the Rayapur of Chhattisgarh an unparalleled attempt was made - this is the first hump festival of the state .
The aim of being in the guidance of this festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation is that cleanliness awareness .
Using the city's toilets in a new way, making aware of the various methods of repeating the huts.
There are several types of activities in this festival .
Students started in these, all participated up to the elders.
Using pools, designed variety of artistic items.
There were arrangements for training in all the repairs related to architectural sales.
The sacred music program was also planned.
Artistics have been created.
Raeypur's adventurous, other district people also organized hunting fairs for their share.
Everyone shared new ideas related to satisfaction in the synthesis, engaged in arguments, organized architects.
There was an atmosphere like a fair with the center of sanctity .
Especially school children participate in it with great enthusiasm , this is a unique thing .
In the very beautiful ways of observation , the importance of sanitation , etc . , I am demonstrating my admiration of the people of Raipur municipality , the people of Chhattisgarh , the government and the government administration there .
Every year on the 8th day of March we celebrate international women daily .
Well, in our country, all over the world, it's arranged for many events.
In the past , women who have done pre-experiences in various departments have been awarded the award of NARY on this day .
Today the country has come to the direction of women's progress, women's head progress.
I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
The perfect womanhood of the idea is perfect andependence, that he says that the entire freedom is full of women.
The idea of Vivekananda's testimony before 125 years shows the idea of female power in the Indian culture.
Today, in every field of social, economic conditions, it is our duty to ensure that women's participation is equal.
We're in the traditional family of women who mark men.
Yesotha Menton, Koshala portrain, Kandarich- no man was recognized like this.
Today our women are showing strength and self-confidence in their activities.
We're making you a surprising person.
In the same way, when you're ahead, we're engaged in the work of travelers to a new plane, promoting the nation.
Where women are powerful and are partners in all the developments of the country, they dream of our own new India.
In the past, someone has given me a very excellent advice.
On the 8th day of the month of March women are organised on various occasions everyday .
Wouldn't there be women who have completed 100 years in every village
Can't you arrange events like maternal grandmothers
Can you tell everyone about their long-standing journey
That guy liked me the idea he said, I'm bringing it to everyone's attention.
Enlightened specimens of what can be slaughtered by women's power.
If you observe your sight, you'll get many high truths of your life's prediction.
I got information from Jharkhand state a few days ago that only 15 lakh women were working together, one month's cleaning was done.
This year, on 26th January, only 20 days, these women have made an advance of one lakh fifteen thousand arches.
There are only one lakh members in it.
14 lakh women, 2000 journalist representatives, 29,000 women engaged in drunken labor, 10,000 sanitation workers, 50,000 women engaged in the industrial industry participated in this.
It's not a small number.
You can imagine how big it is
In the life of simple people, with the sanctity of pure culture, it has been shown by women with Jharkhand that it is the ability to change the nature of the different worlds.
Brothers, in three villages of Eliphanda Islands, when I was watching the news two days ago, they were so happy about how electricity came after 70 years of independence.
Eliphanda island is only 10 kilometres from the sea shore of Mumbai .
Me.
It's far away.
This is an important center for tourism.
Eliphanda Caves declared world heritage symbol by the formation of UNESCO.
Here everyday there are many colors of tourists coming from our country and abroad .
This is an important tourist spot .
It was such an important tourist spot, it gave me great surprise to reach Mumbai and reach freedom for so many years, where electricity did not reach.
For 70 years there were three villages of Elephanta Diu , Rajbandar , Morbandar , Sandbhandra , who had gone away from the lives of the people who were drowned in cough .
For the administration there, people are determining my lives.
The villages of Eliphanda and the caves of Eliphanda are filled with fresh light.
It's not just electricity.
A new beginning in the development journey.
The lives of the folks will be enlightened, the joy in their lives, and what else can be the sight of pleasure and enjoyment
My life and the best brothers, we celebrated the festival of Shivratri a few days ago.
The month of March is green boiling trees , the beauty of flourishing vegetation , charming potatoes of mind - these are the specialities of yourself leaving this month .
In the same way, the Holib Pundick, which comes in this month, is one of the closest to ourselves.
The festival of Holipe will be celebrated with great enthusiasm throughout the country on the 2nd day of March .
How many colors are important in the Holip festival , which is important for Holika .
Because, on this day, we're suppressing all the evils in the corner.
Forgetting all the differences, participating in the pleasures of one another, compassionate and comprehensive views, this is giving this unique message to Holip.
Festivals of all the folks and colors before the Holib festival , colorful lives .
It's my heart to enjoy the pleasures of all the lives of the folk folks.
My favorite folks, thanks, thanks.
