This is the television of the Prasang Path, the Minister of State on April 24, 2016 in Akashwani.
My country's favourite.
Namaskara.
Now summer time.
Everyone prepares plans for summer holidays.
It's also the time of mango fruits, we'll enjoy tasting these fruits.
We feel like it's funny to kiss a little bit off at midday once.
But this year the sun has ruined everybody's fun.
It's so natural that the racial aggression about the hot summer.
Moreover, in the last two years, there was an adverse effect on the places where the water was collected.
Sometimes because of the cubza, sometimes the water flow in the reservoirs, and other water streams of sand was blocked.
As a result, the reservoirs can only accumulate water less than their capacity.
And the odd thing is that, this is the round of cyclone that continues.
This has reduced the capacity of these reservoirs.
Governments are trying to solve the problem, relax the water hike.
But that's not the same.
Christians are supposed to do decent work to face the situation.
Several villages are now supposed to be aware.
Those who experience the deficiency of water know the value of water.
So, in such places, they're so careful about water.
And, the water's gonna be doing something to squeeze.
He told me what happened recently.
In the Hive Rebjar village of Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, those villages have been enjoying the importance of water deficiency, so much smooth problem.
Someone can see the villages that are desperate to collect water.
In Hive Rebzar, the farms have solved the problem by turning the crop up.
Water needs more crops.
I mean, they decided to absorb the sewing of Artis.
It's very easy to hear, but it's not really so easy.
Is it so big enough to decide
Anyone can imagine anybody's commitment to stop their units by telling the people who used to excessively use water.
But see the disappearance of these peasant brothers.
They thought that the crop would have to be boiled for the cultivation of dearness, so they thought that the crop would not be finished.
Besides wheat, so much less water like fruits, cucumbers are planting crops.
Sprenchler Lu, Window Carriage, Water Harvesting, Water Recharging.
They follow many kinds of programs like this.
Now their village has the power to stand in front of the water supply.
I can't talk about a small village like Hive Rebzar, so many such villages are there.
I'm telling them my heartful joys that's the best work they're doing for the residents of those villages.
Ever said to me, in the Devas district of Madhya Pradesh, the Gorwa village is Panchayati.
This Panchayati triggered a work to build a pond.
About 27 crops have been set up.
That's how the level of geography has grown.
The water came up.
When the crop is sufficient, water is available.
About 20 percent of their business products have increased.
That's how the water was swollen.
When the water comes up.
Then there's a lot of change in the deficiency of water.
Clean fresh water is also called GDP growth.
The health becomes shiny.
When the water reaches Latur through the Bharata Prabhuvat Railway, it will be a news for the propaganda.
It's real.
How fast the railway did this pack.
It's very pleasant.
But the villagers are equally respected.
I don't know such symptoms that come to Amal through the public.
Sometimes the good words about the dominant puzzles come forward.
But how many kinds of people try to face the luckyness around the man, how new things are supposed to do for the pursuit.
It's comfortable for Manish to get rid of a clean news that's very good as soon as he's gone.
This time 106 per cent to 101 per cent in the year of the year when the information came , the people enjoyed a peaceful message .
It's so funny that the fate of the fate of the fate of the fate of the fate of the fate of the fate of the year, the consciousness.
But my country's favourite.
He'll give a warning at the same level as he's enjoying this joy in the morning.
Man Prati village has managed to drive a work from now on.
Farmers have a smell of mud.
It's the soil to grow in the field.
This time there is a debris of soil to pour soil in the pond.
Why don't you put the soil in the field this time in the lake
The layer also falls well.
The power to accumulate water for the field also increases.
Sometimes in the cement plants, sometimes the rocks in empty moistures, soil- that water can not be stopped by blocking them on the paths of growing water.
Five days of water, if the water is all standing for seven days.
It gets stuck in the ground.
The water of the earth comes up by crossing.
Water reaches the shores.
How much water can be stopped, stop the water.
The water of fertilizer, the village water is in the village.
By doing something like this, by making a bullshit.
That's all possible through social experiment.
It's so hard for the ఈనాడు water.
The survivors.
But it's time for a month and a half.
I always say so.
When the mind goes to Mahatma Gandhi Janma-based Porbandar, in many countries we see.
Fucking sheep in the inner part of the earth to hide the water of the van.
You can also see.
Ramami built 200 shoes to collect the water.
The water collected in these ghettoes was so clean.
Mr. Kumar Krishna was born in MyGov.
A kind of curiosity was also distracted.
I'm sure.
During the life of the Ganges, the work of the Ganges was finished from the years.
There's a lot of landlords.
It's running from around 30 years.
There's a lot of landlords.
Several plans have been made.
It's too funny.
So it's very adventurous to seduce this mission in crores of people of the country like Soddu Kumar Krishna.
Those who are in a spiritual state are salvations of the Ganges.
I think this spiritual ritual.
But it's pretty important tongue that's the life of Ganga.
From the Ganges, the food of Man is available.
From the Ganges, Man gets daily packs.
There's a new power to stop Man from the Ganges.
If the Ganga flows, the country's economic maturity also gets a new description.
A Bhagirath brought the Ganges to Man.
But there is a need for millions of Bhagiraths to protect it.
I can't suffice anybody in this punny without the part of the public.
That's why Prati becomes a pace of change for cleanliness.
Please tell the same thing, please.
There are many attempts from Lord Tarafu.
The Ganges shore is also being tried to take full support from all the states swimming.
It also plays the role of social institutions, clean institutions.
We're taking a lot of symptoms to stop industrial pollution.
Prati arrives in the Ganges everyday in a large quantity of rubbles mixed with cattle .
In order to clean such a shit, the rubbishing of the shit is going on at Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna.
All the local corporations wanted to clean this thing up and clean the shit.
On the other hand, this purple activity is going on, I knew about the 11-two wheel of the three-two tunnels every day.
I mean, that fucking fucking fucking fucking shit.
It's a thought to put trash skimmers on the other side in the coming days.
That's why the benefits of the Ganges come to the shores of rivers in the morning.
The paper for controlling industrial pollution, cutting off with sugar purisrms and setting up a caricature system.
Somewhere it started.
I'm supposed to make good slippers through this too.
Uttarakhand, some officials told me to control the extracts coming from the distilleries in the Uttara Pradesh.
The pollution coming from the paper purisrum also almost stopped.
I'm gonna go ahead in the solitary direction, knowing that a miracle might have been killed.
Kevla isn't gonna live on the banks of Ganga.
They also go to the southern regions smoothly as the Minister of the Protector of the Ganges is going on.
This jan is the belief in general, I think I'm supposed to bring the supremacy of the Ganga.
Progress is also giving disturbances for the work of the Ganges.
Well, this effort is so careful.
My country's favourite.
April 24 this day.
In the country of heavy today, Panchayati Raj is going to live on the day.
Panchayati Raj's business in the country came into operation on this day.
The Panchayat Raj system is continuously spread to the nation.
And it's turning into a major part of the Man Prajaswamy's business, surviving it.
On April 14, Babasaheb Ambedkar celebrated the 125th birth anniversary.
I'm going to celebrate the day of Panchayati Raj on 24th April this day.
That's the satisfaction of the glory of the majesty who has given a heavy test.
The most important part of the 24th Tarikh.
Fucking sisters.
The inspiration of both of them.
Therefore, the Kulsi Kendra Prabhu of the State Government took the work of "Gram Uday Sai Bharath Uday" with the day from April 14 to 24.
I'm lucky to see Babasaheb Ambedkar's native Babasaheb janmasthan to go to 'Mahu'.
That pavilion land was supposed to namask.
And on the 24th stark this day, sodreams of Girzan Sodriman are more living.
It's going to Jharkhand State that the Panchaya Tiraj is going to roam.
For three hours in the afternoon, Panchaya Tiraj was speaking to all the Panchayatis in the country.
This activity has made a very big deal of dealing.
How to establish democracy business in the village level of the original origin of India.
How do you make yourself the paths needed for the development of the villages
Give me the pride.
The socio-social supremacy must be preferred to the fundamental supremacy.
Don't be a drag from the campus in the village.
"Beti Bachao" - Bati Padavo' should move the work wise.
Female cub must be the whole village of Janmadin.
A lot of things like this.
In some villages the process of giving irregular food has also passed.
In these villages of the country it is impossible to roam these kinds of activities with day and day .
The state's privileges, all of the village sarpanchs, are saying sort of interest.
I've brought a new life in the fundamental phases.
For the village good, for village development, many pages have been changed to this one chance for democracy.
There's no awareness in the villages.
The same weight will be harmful for the progress.
Get the villages on the basis of heavy progress.
That's why if the whole of the mind bouncing the village progress, we'll end up with the hopeful ritual.
Shermila Dharpure from Mumbai - she disappeared the tension she carried through the phone.
(SIGHS SHOUTING)
(WHISPERING) The Minister.
Namaskara.
I'm talking to Shermila Dharpure from Mumbai.
It's your prayer for school, college education.
In the Vidyarangam, it was a very rough procession.
Ganny, the castles don't go to Ganny, or not to be foolish.
How do you think.
The kids are finishing education.
But, many times they don't even know the fundamentals.
My kids are left behind in this competition.
What you think about it.
I'm gonna take a walk in this area.
Please tell us about it.
Sharmilaji, it's so compassionate for you.
Now if there's any dream for the slaves in the family of the family, it's gonna be good for the kids.
Shut up home, smile.
They're all coming by that shit.
In a country like a wealthy country, this is the feeling of one.
That's too big.
Fucking the kids.
It's good to learn, to be disturbed about getting good education.
It'll rise further.
And there's a lot more funny about it.
And now I think that the family of this obsession falls on the pathshalas.
Teachers come to Meda.
Children are also uncomfortable that I'm going to school for anything.
That's why the little guys, that's the beauty of thinking about this thing, I'm sure I'm fond of talking to the children about all the things happening in school.
If anything comes to your notice, go and talk to the teachers automatically.
This nigh busy man can reduce a lot of infestations in the educational business.
There's so much the role of the private part in getting it.
In the country of Man, every institution of education has been preferred.
But Prati Prabhuti has also worked in some way.
It's very comfortable that the vision of the university was surpassed.
The practice of disintegrating the educational business , keeping schools , organizing colleges , fostering teachers , pouring many children to the pupils , i . e . a kind of education has begun to spread the direction.
That's the privilege.
It's also a matter of time.
But now it's the greatest privilege of displacement, the most advanced educational sector.
I've finished the big fucking man.
Now you have to pay attention to funny education.
The good education must be changed from all the weekends.
Now the numbers are 'outle'.
Now the Outcome has to be sure on the fleet.
Now the number of people who came to the school was noticed on it.
Now take care of learning more than scooling.
Accompanying the schools.
Accommodation.
This mantra is going to be quiet.
But now it's a good education for the children who have reached school.
Good education.
It must concentrate the mind on it.
You've seen the presidency budget, Kada.
It's going to try to baptize education.
The man has to move a long distance in it.
But monkey.
125 crores of the country's project.
Decision is also a far-flung journey.
But Sharmilaji's word is true.
It's okay to get down.
This time you're gonna see in the budget... we've served differently.
I'm telling you to come back to the next civilian world, the next private worldwide students to get rid of the pregnant bondages in the budget.
I mean, you're gonna do what you want to do for the highest world classes.
I took that action to give them freedom.
Large world scholars don't even have to face world competition, that's what they do.
Besides, how preferred education is.
That's excellent skill.
And technical knowledge in education is supplied to a very big ground.
Distance education, technical science... it embraces the educational status.
And I believe that I'm supposed to see their flames very soon.
For a long time, the prayers are heading me on a thing.
Some are my website mygov.
They're coming in.
Some others are coming to me at the NarendramodiApp.
Yet youngsters come more.
The Minister of Sound Beat-Propaganda, Namaskar.
I'm talking to Mona Karnwal from Big Nor.
Now, with the young people's death.
Sports are also very important.
They also have the feeling of Tem Spirit.
And also have the quality of good nerves.
That's how their personality grows.
It's my appreciation.
Because . myself I am in the Bharath Scouts and Guides .
It showed how good it was on my life.
You want youngsters to seek more awareness.
Prabhu also wants to promote NCC, Bharat Scouts and Guides.
Before you talk to your beauty, how many instructions you're giving.
I promised to talk to them.
Your beauty pressure, your beauty instructions, and all the following way, that NCC, NSS, India Scouts and Guids, Red Cross chiefs, Nehru Yuva Centre, have a comprehension.
This is the first time it was said that when they asked for the samavesh majesty, they said that this is the first time the celebration of the country's freedom.
That's why I'm telling the young friends who have pressed me into all these things.
I'm sorry because of them.
I thought it was better to do that.
I've seen a lot of time.
They're doing a lot in their way.
But if you're struggling with the social sector, you'll see how big it is.
It's so extensive.
How many families do it know.
I got a big trick to see its widespread.
It's too serious.
Something has to be done.
And I'm supposed to be ANC CADET.
That's why I know a new vision of such congressional affairs.
Get inspiration.
A national phenomenon grows.
I found that benefit only in childhood.
I also know a new life control in these institutions.
Fill the new power.
This time I put something in front of them.
Look at me.
Why don't the jail surveillance be high in this season.
How many blankets, how many districts will be reminded of Bahiranga Mala Visarjan.
These countries will be used as non-proliferated countries of Bahiranga Mala.
Any kind of action to unite the country.
Let's keep the young lyric of all these organizations.
Several such churches accumulated with them.
Now, I'm a shit for you.
Please suggest ways to these young people's organizations.
Would we have any newness in their workshops, their activities
If you bring me on my NarendramodiApp, I'll send them to the right place.
And I think they're gonna put a new speed after this suspension.
Yeah, you also want to get rid of them.
My country's favourite.
This day you're gonna tell me the thing he's thinking.
It's also triggered by the poison that swallowed the bullshit.
You're gonna see
The country's royal positions were going on to discuss this matter in the last few elections.
How many gas cylinders are that party.
12 Sylinderla.
Or 9 Sylinderla.
That's a big fascination in the election.
Anyway, the state's parties were feeling like Gas Sylinder's big part in the wake of the selection of the Mediterranean ritual.
There was pressure from economic scientists to drag stones on another side.
That's why many committees have been made.
Those coordinators have a tiny tampering on the cooking gas rock.
There are suggestions on the possibility of reducing gas subsidies.
There are crores of rupees on these committees.
But the thing's going to be right there.
It's perfect for everybody.
Nobody thinks more about it.
On this day, my dear country dweller, I'm so enjoyed to keep my own poison before you.
I picked up the third path.
That's the third way to believe in the public, the general public.
Sometimes the royal nobles should remind us of the people better than putting their heads on their heads.
We have to believe deeply in people.
I kidding me once.
Why don't you leave your gas subsidi in a fifteen thousand-2000 bucks for the surveillance
That's it.
It can be used for poor families.
Yeah, I've told you that words really.
In this matter I'm going to say early this day.
My countrymen didn't leave my nama.
A million families switched the guys subsidy.
These dead families are not rich families.
A retire teacher, retained Gumasta, farmers or small shops.
Like the middle of the middle, they left the subsidie, the lower middle of the middle.
It's too light to get rid of Subsidy over.
The mobile phone can be carried out by the app.
Can be done in online.
Subsidy can be left even by calling Miss D to Telecommunications.
There are boiled methods like this.
But it is a matter of surprisingly surprising that 80 percent of the people who have gone to the family of Sabsydy went to the purchaser, guessing that they were not able to surround Subsidy again, they were fully informed.
Lovely my country, it's not a little matter.
Whenever the governor gives a paw of rocks, or mines, the news comes in the TV with a week's time, shining the pride in the television.
But see it.
A million families are in the custody of Subsidi.
In the country of Man, the subsidy has left these families in a way.
I'm pronouncing Sahasra to those millions of families.
I appreciate them.
Because, they've made the royal nerves think new.
This one thing is that the economic scientists in the country also think differently.
Do this.
It's going to happen.
In such a attempt, the economic communications, counts, symptoms, the economic experts, who think of crossing the system, have left this subsidi.
Think deeper sometimes in this matter.
Grace cylinders to another foul family instead of dragging a million family members of Sabsydi.
Subsidy's leaving the dubby is not a big thing to say to those who look at it from the boy.
But by believing in the rains, it's an impossible legacy that can be achieved as big as it is.
Everything of the royal ranges is specially known to me.
Please tell the thing that's gonna put a nama on the public.
You don't guess you're supposed to find such filths.
Man must move forward in this direction.
I'm gonna get a fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' fuckin' thing.
Thirty-three-seat employees, why do they intervene.
We have to believe the person dedicating the marks list, observing the inquiry.
Sometimes I feel something else.
In some ways in the train operations, the people who checked all the tickets should be sent to the house.
Put the barosa on the country's public.
You can do many kinds of uses.
If you put such a snake once, you'll find unwanted filths.
Okay, these imaginations in my mind, can't change them to the governor's bondage.
But such a thing can be reflected by the windows.
These sanctuaries aren't the royal nobles.
In the country of Man, only millions of families were killed.
A man named Ravy wrote a letter to me.
[GROANING SHOUTTING]
And he did this again.
Please propose to post a good event every day, that's what your authorities are saying.
In Prati Newspaper, everything's inevitable in the Breaking News located in TV channel.
125 crores of Janaba is the best thing around this country or the jarga.
That's how you change this situation.
Ravy distracted his anger.
But, not on me, darling.
I guess it's on the fixed circumstances now.
You remember, the former state doctor A.
P.
J.
Abdol Kalam, when they're saying, "Please make a good news in the newspaper's first statement."
They used to repeat this complex again every time.
A few days ago, a news story came to Naco.
"On Monday, we decided not only to give good news but to any bad news." It's the end of it.
These days some T.
V.
I've seen the channels spend some time for good news.
I'm gonna tell you a survivor at the end of the audience.
Good news, the news of the news seems to be surprised by everyone.
How important is it.
That's how funny it is.
What a wonderful way.
I don't think it's more powerful than a clean news.
There's a good news that might inspire the man.
So the soul will ball better.
Don't suppose it's supposed to be bad.
If a light is burnt, the darkness will be removed.
Get off.
You'll have to know.
Prabhuti nadips a website called the Transforming plan.
This website has all kinds of news.
That's not from the government side.
Good news from the public, the plots are in it.
Not that much.
If you know something good, you can also send good news to you.
Ravy, you've been so good indicating.
But, please don't be so angry at me.
To make something positive, talk positive, we have to fall together to bring positive things into the spread.
The specific excitement of 'Kumbha fair' in the country of Man.
The Kumbh fair also stands an attraction for tourism.
Within these days, hundreds of people reach the bank of a river, know a lot of people bathing on foot.
Enjoy this excitement in the calm, peaceful atmosphere.
Unfortunate.
Please, for example.
Perhaps the part of the public.
Such excitements direct new memories at a very heavy level.
I've spent a few days uploading the photographs of many lions of Kumbh.
I think the Central, the State Government's neighbourhoods have a philosophical competition.
Take good photos, propagate the projects to upload.
Please create an exciting atmosphere, awareness with such photographs.
The difference is that Kumbh has stepped up in the fair.
I know how magnificent complications are.
It must be quiet.
Recently, the Prime Minister of Madhya Pradesh killed me.
I'm giving messages about man's cleanliness.
But, it's not just playing where it is.
I'm supposed to say to the public, if you're gonna climb up the man, you're gonna kick that message.
Even though the Kumbh fair is a spiritual excitement, it must be considered as a social prospect.
Change some phrase to sing.
In these products, the man can afford good luck, good habits and preserve them to propagate in those territory villages.
How to raise love, water.
How to raise faith in the jall.
Water sequence, how to collect.
This fair can be learned by the Man Kumbh fair as soon as possible.
Think how to use this symptom of this Kumbh fair.
I love my country...
In the main event like the Panchayati Raj Day, I'll meet you all this evening.
Thanks to my heart to your beauty.
Whenever, for your mind's thoughts, the bond of my mind's thoughts will enjoy me immensely.
.
