Talking about the mind, October 2016, my dear countrymen, all of you greet Deepawali.
Deepawali festival is celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is such a country that 365 days, in some corner of the country, there is no celebration.
The person from a distance will ever feel that like Indian life, this is the second name of the festival, and it is also natural.
Since the Vedic period, the festivals which have been traditional in India till today have been celebrating with a timely change, we have seen the courage to end the tradition of Kalbahya festivals and according to the demand of time and society, changes in festivals have also been accepted easily.
But one thing in all of these can be seen well that this whole journey of the festivals of India, its occupation, its depth, its entry in the masses, is linked to a original mantra. Take the self towards the culmination.
Expansion of individuals and personalities, efforts should be made to expand the scope of their limited thinking, from society to the universe and through these festivals.
Festivals of India sometimes look like a meal of food.
But in what season is the weather, what should you eat in what season
What is the yield of farmers, how to turn that yield into celebration
What are the rites in terms of health
All these things, our ancestors have gathered in a big scientific way, in the festival.
Today the whole world discusses the Environment.
Nature-destruction is a matter of concern.
The festival tradition of India has been going to communicate every person from the child, who makes nature-love strong.
There are trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, people who are responsible for each one are celebrating.
Nowadays, we celebrate Sunday, but those who are old generations, are a laboring class, fishermen, you have seen the tradition here for centuries. To celebrate full moon and moon.
And science has proved that the way full moon and moon rises, what is the effect of nature on the water of the sea.
And it also has an impact on human mind.
That is, till here our holiday also developed the tradition of celebrating with Brahman and Science.
Today, when we celebrate Deepawali festival, as I said, every festival of our festival is a educational, comes with the understanding of education.
This festival of Deepawali gives a message of going towards light from the darkness of "Tamso Ma Jyotirgamya".
And darkness, it is not a darkness of light, darkness is also darkness, illiteracy is darkness, poverty is also dark, social evils are also dark.
Deepawali's given liberation, the society which is blindly shadowed, the person who is blindly shadowed, also liberated from the darkness, and the same becomes the festival of lighting by burning Diwali.
One thing we all know well, go to any corner of India, go to the house of Amir-Se-Amer, go to the poor hut, in the festival of Diwali, the campaign of cleanliness in every family seems to be running.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
There will be poor pottery of your soil, so the soil utensils also clean such as it has just come to Diwali.
Diwali is also a hygiene campaign.
But, there is a demand for time that not only cleaning the house, the cleaning of the entire premises, the cleanliness of the entire village, the cleanliness of the entire village, we have to expand our nature and tradition, expand.
The festival of Deepawali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
Deepawali festival is remembered in some form in all the countries of the world, celebrated.
Many governments of the world are also becoming a part of the festival of Deepawali, even the Parliament there.
Whether the country is east or west, whether it is a developed country or a developing country, whether it is Arica, whether I
Reland, everyone looks away from Diwali.
You guys will know, US Postal Service of America, they have released Deepawali's postage stamp this time.
Lanada's Prime Minister, on the occasion of Deepawali, burnt his picture on Twitter.
The Prime Minister of Britain organized a Reception program connecting all the communities in Deepawali in London, himself took part and perhaps there will be no such city in K, where Diwali is not celebrated with large crowds.
Singapore's Prime Minister ji
The picture has been placed on nstagram and he has shared that picture with the world and has done it with great pride.
And what is the picture.
16 female MPs of Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament wearing Indian sari and this photo virol has happened.
And that ' s all about Diwali .
Diwali is being celebrated these days in every street of Singapore
The Prime Minister of Australia has called the Indian community to join Diwali and join every society in Deepawali festival in different cities of Australia.
Now the New Yealand Prime Minister had come, he told me that I have to go back quickly because I have to join the Diwali function there.
I mean to say that Deepawali is a festival of light, an inspiration to bring the world community from darkness to light.
On the festival of Deepawali, there is a lot of good clothes, good food and firecrackers.
And boys, young men have great pleasure.
But sometimes children also misbehave.
In an attempt to make a big voice of tax by collecting many firecrackers, they invite a very big accident.
Never mind what there are things around, there will be no fire.
In the days of Deepawali, news of sudden news, news of fire, news of immortality, makes big concerns.
And there is also a problem that in the days of Diwali, doctors have gone to celebrate Diwali with a large number of their families, then there is a crisis in crisis.
My special tax parents, parents, Guardians are specially urged that when children run firecrackers, elders should stand together, no mistake, they should worry and avoid the accident. .
Deepawali festival runs very long in our country.
That's not just one day.
Say Govardhan Puja, say brother Dooj, say beneficial Panchami, and take Kartik Purnima's light-parve, then in a way a long period runs.
Along with this, we celebrate Deepawali festival and also prepare for Chhath-Puja.
The festival of Chhath-Puja in the eastern region of India is a very big festival.
In a way there is a great festival, it lasts for four days, but it has a specialty - gives a big deep message to society.
What God gives us, we get everything from it.
It is difficult for us to calculate what is found directly and indirectly, it is difficult for us to calculate it and it is also a festival of worship of Chhath-Puja, Sun.
But the proverb is that Bhai, people worship the rising sun in the world.
Chhath-Puja is a festival in which the sun is worshiped.
There is a very big social message in it .
I talk about the festival of Deepawali, speak of Chhath-Puja - This is the time to give you a lot of good wishes, but there is time for me as well, thank the people of Khaskar, express gratitude.
Over the last few months, the incidents that are taking shape, our army personnel are looting everything for our happiness.
On my emotions, the soldiers of the army, the soldiers of the security forces, these sacrifices, penance, hard work, are shadowed on my heart and mind.
And one of the same things had been done in mind that it was dedicated to the name of Diwali security forces.
I invited the countrymen to the Sandesh to Soldiers for a campaign.
But I want to bow down my head today, there will be no human being in India, in whose heart there is pride towards the army, the pride of security forces.
The manner in which he has been expressed, it is going to give power to every countrymen.
We can not imagine the security forces, so encouraging, your message has appeared as a force.
School, college, be a student, a village, a poor, a businessman, a shopkeeper, a politician, a player, a cinema - There will be hardly any one left, who has not given it to the soldiers of the country Have not given messages for the soldiers of the country.
The media also overturned the occasion of expressing gratitude to the army and why not, whether it is BSF, ROP, I
Ando-Tibetan Police, Assam Riles, water-service, land-service, nave-service, Host Guard, I can't speak the names of all, countless.
How do our soldiers suffer - when we are celebrating Diwali, someone is standing in the desert, someone is protecting the industry, then someone is protecting the airport.
How many are the responsibility
When we are in the mood of the festival, remember it at the same time, then there is a new strength in that memory too.
Efficiency increases in a message and the country showed tax.
I really express gratitude to the countrymen.
Many, who had art, did through art.
Some people made pictures, made Rangoli, made cartoons, who favored Saraswati, made poems II
Many showed good slogans.
It seems to me, like my Narendra Modi app or my Gov, as the ocean of emotions has risen in it - as a word, as a back, as a pen, as a color, As innumerable feelings, I can imagine, how proud is a moment for my country's soldiers.
Sandesh to Soldiers have come so many things on this ashtag, symbolically.
I will like to read a poem, Mr. Ashwani Kumar Chauhan
Ashwani ji has written - "I celebrate festivals, I am happy, smile, I celebrate festivals, I am happy, smile, all this, because you are, I tell you today, because of my freedom, you are happy, I sleep peacefully, because I am sleeping with peace, because you are posted on the border, the mountains of Sheesh and the glass of India, the Mount of Mount Ambara and the glassses of India, you are my army, the same way you are mys, the army is also mys.
.
My dear countrymen, whose maternal uncle is full of army personnel and whose in-laws are also full of army soldiers, such a sister Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Come, let's hear what the Fauji family says: - "Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shivani Mohan."
The Sandesh to Soldiers campaign launched on this Deepawali is getting very encouragement from our fellow brothers.
I'm from an Army family.
My husband is also an Army Officer.
My father and father-in-law, both have been Army Vicers.
So we are full of family soldiers and we have many such icers on the border, which are getting so good messages and are getting very encouragement all in the Army Fircle.
And I would like to say that their families, their wives, along with Army Vicers and Soldiers, also do enough sacrificies.
So in a way the entire Army Community is getting a very good message and I would like to call you also appy Diwali.
Thank you. My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the army are found standing on every front of life, not just on the border.
There should be natural calamities, sometimes there is a crisis of law and order, sometimes fighting enemies, sometimes show courage to bring back the young people on the wrong path - our youngsters are inspired by nation spirit at every turn of life. Keep working.
An event was brought into my attention - I want to tell you too
Now I want to tell you what kind of things becomes a great force at the root of success.
You must have heard, Himachal Pradesh was freed from defecation in the open, the pen effication was free.
Earlier Sikkim was established, now Himachal also happened, Kerala is going to be on November 1.
But why is this success
The reason I tell you, look, one of our IDs in the security forces
TBP's young man, Shri Vikas Thakur - he is basically from a small village of Sirmaur district of Himachal.
Their village is named Badhana.
They are from Sirmaur district of Himachal.
Now this is our ID
TBP jawans went to their villages on their duty.
So in the village, he was probably going to be somewhere in the village, then he reached there and was discussing in the meeting of the village, construction of toilets and found that some families were unable to make toilets in the absence of money.
This development Tagore is full of patriotism
TBP's young man, he felt - no, no, these stigma should be eradicated.
And look at his patriotism, he serves the country only to run bullets on enemies, it is not so.
He took out a thousand rupees from his heavy book and gave it to the Panchayat Pradhan of the village that in 57 houses where no toilets have been made, give each family a thousand rupees, make 57 toilets and make your Badhana village a pension efficacy free.
Vikas Thakur did it.
By giving 57 families one thousand rupees to their pockets, they gave a warning to cleanliness campaign.
And then only then Himachal Pradesh came to take the opportunity to refresh.
In Kerala, I really want to express gratitude to the youth.
I came to know, in the remote forests of Kerala, where there is no way, after walking all day long, that village can be reached difficultly, such a tribal panchayat, Idmalakudi, is also very difficult to reach.
People never go.
Nearly, in urban areas, students of ngineering came to the notice that there are toilets in this village.
NK Cadet, NSS people, students of Engineering, all decided to build toilets together.
The goods that had to be taken to make toilets, be bricks, cements, all the goods raised on their shoulders and went to those forests walking all day long.
He worked hard and made toilets in that village and these youths freed a small village in remote forests.
The reason for that is that Kerala is getting the Pen Deecation Free.
Gujarat has also declared all municipalities-Mahanagar municipalities, perhaps more than 150, pen effication free.
10 districts have also been executed.
Haryana has also received good news, Haryana is also going to celebrate its own Golden Jubilee on November 1 and their decision is that they will raise the entire state in a few months.
Now they have completed seven districts.
Work is going on very fast in all the states.
I mentioned something.
I congratulate the citizens of all these states for contributing to the work of eradicating dirt from the country to join this great work.
My dear countrymen, the plans in the government are very much.
And after the first plan, the second good plan comes in line with it, then the first plan has to be left.
But generally no one pays attention to these things.
The old plan also continues, the new plan continues and the next plan continues to wait, it continues.
In our country where there is a gas stove, houses in which there is electricity, such houses do not need Kerosene.
But who asks in the government, Kerosene is also going, gas is also going, electricity is also going and then middlemen get a chance to eat cream.
I want to congratulate Haryana Pradesh that they have taken a lead.
Haryana Pradesh to free Kerosene
In the families where there is a gas stove, the families in which there is electricity, "He verified from the base number" and so far I have heard that seven or eight districts were killed, Kerosene has been released."
The way they have taken this work, the whole state, I believe it will soon be Kerosene Ree.
How big changes will come, theft will also stop, the benefit of the environment will also be, our origin exchange will also save and the convenience of the people will also increase.
Yes, there will be trouble, then the middlemen will be, dishonest people will be.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
Everything should be said to the country today, how to go, decide the standard for this.
Gandhiji used to say, whenever you make a plan, remember the face of that poor and weak first and then decide if that poor will not benefit from what you are going to do.
It will not be harmed anywhere.
Based on this standard, you decide.
The demand of time is that we will have to adjust the aspirations of the poor people of the country.
We get rid of trouble, for that we have to take one step.
Why not our old thinking, but society must be freed from the distinction of son and daughter.
Now there are toilets for the girls in schools, children are also available.
This is the opportunity of discriminating India for our daughters.
The vaccination is done by the government, but still millions of children are left out of vaccination.
They become victims of disease.
"A campaign of mission rainbow vaccination, which is also engaged in absorbing the missing children, which enables children to recover from serious diseases."
It is 21st century and there is darkness in the village, it can not work now and so to free the villages from darkness, a big campaign to reach the village is successfully moving forward.
It is moving forward in the deadline.
After so many years of independence, after cooking food on poor mother, wood stove, take 400 cigarette smoke in your body, what will be the health of her health.
Try to give 50 million families free lives from smoke.
Proceeding towards success.
The small businessman, the small businessman, the vegetable seller, the seller of milk, the barber shop, used to be stuck in the interest of the moneylenders - it used to be stuck.
Money Scheme, stand up plan, public money account, this is a successful mission of liberation from interest loggers.
Deposit of money directly in banks by the base.
Haqdar, get the beneficiary directly.
These intermediaries have an opportunity to liberate in the life of the common man.
There is a campaign to run, in which there is no improvement and change, the path to freedom from the problem is to be confirmed and happening.
My dear countrymen, yesterday 31 October, the great man of this country - who made the mantra of his life, showed ji - Such Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel is the festival of birth and birth.
On October 31, there is a festival of Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, the victory of the unity of the country is the great man, on the other hand, the death anniversary of Mrs. Gandhi is also there.
We remember the great men, we should do well.
But the phone of a gentleman of Punjab, his suffering, touched me too: - "Prime Minister, Namaskar, Sir, I am speaking Jasdeep from Punjab."
Sir, as you know, Sardar Patel's birthday is on 31st.
Sardar Patel is an individual, who spent all his life in the country, Nu Dadan and O that campaign Vich, I
Think, also succeed, he brought everybody together. And we call it for we call it, a bad luck of the country that Indira Gandhiji was murdered on the same day.
And as we all know how they were alive in the country after their murder.
Sir, I wanted to say how we can stop these unfortunate events that are unfortunate.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of a person.
A Sardar, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, history is witness to the fact that after Chanakya, the Bhagirath work of uniting the country was done by Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Azad India, successful attempt to bring under a flag, so much big Bhagirath work done by the great man, that great man was 100 bowing down.
But it is also a pain that Sardar sahab lived for unity, struggled for unity
Due to their priority of unity, many were also victims of anger, but never left the path of unity
But, on the birth anniversary of the same Sardar thousands of Sardars, families of thousands of Sardars were killed after the murder of Mrs. Gandhi.
On the birthday of that great man who lives for unity and on Sardar's birthday, a page of history, pains us all.
But, in the midst of these crises, the mantra of unity is to move forward.
Unity in diversity is the entity of the country.
There are many languages, many castes, many dresses, many food and drinks, but unity in diversity, it is the strength of India, India's specialty.
Every generation has a responsibility.
It is responsible for every government that we find opportunities for unity in every corner of the country, raise the element of unity.
We also avoid scattering thinking, scattering trend, save the country too.
Sardar Sahib gave us a India, we all have the responsibility to make the best India.
The original mantra of unity makes the strong foundation of India.
Sardar Saheb's life journey started with the struggle of farmers.
The farmer's son was.
Sardar Saheb played a very important role in reaching the movement of freedom to the farmers.
It was Sardar Saheb's successful attempt to make the movement of freedom in the village.
His organization was the result of power and skill.
But Sardar Saheb was just a man of struggle, not so, he was also a man of structure.
Today sometimes we hear many "Amul" names.
People are familiar with every product of Amool today outside Hindustan and Hindustan.
But very few people would know that Sardar Saheb had a divine vision that he imagined the co-operative milk producers' unit.
And Kheda District was spoken at that time, and in 1942, he emphasized this idea, the real form, how did Sardar Sahib do the creation of the happiness and prosperity of the Amul farmers, a living example is in front of us.
I respectfully give Sardar Sahib Anjali and on this unity day on October 31, remember Sardar Sahib, resolve unity.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima in the series of Diwali - This is also a festival of light festival.
Guru Nanak Dev, his education and initiation are not only for Hindustan, but also for the entire human being, even today.
Service, truth and "Sarbat da Bhala", this was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
This was the basic mantra of peace, unity and goodwill.
Discrimination, superstition, evil, that campaign to liberate society was only in every matter of Guru Nanak Dev.
When we were on the peak of the tangent, untouchable, caste system, high-low, its distortion, then Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his associate.
Come, let us also, Guru Nanak Dev, who has given us the light of knowledge, inspires us to leave discrimination, order to do something against discrimination, "Everyone with everyone, If we have to go ahead, who can be our guide to Guru Nanak Dev"
I also bow to Guru Nanak Dev, this Prakash festival is coming, then I bow to the introduction.
My dear countrymen, once again, the names of the soldiers of the country, these Diwali, also greet you very much on this Diwali.
Your dreams, your resolves are successful in every way.
Your life becomes happy and happy, this gives you all the good wishes.
Thank you very much.
