My favourite patriots, all of you, have a lot of humor for yourselves, the Bengal Translation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Man Ki Baat' (Ashtadash Parvat) program.
Today the people of the Christian community across the world are following Esters.
I'm gonna tell everyone about Estar's very good news.
My young friends, you're all busy now.
Some people may have finished the test.
And there's some guys fighting... because on one hand, on the other hand, T-20 cricket World Cup.
Maybe even today you're waiting for a match between India and Australia.
Prior to this, India has won extraordinaryly in the game against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
There's a very good speed in the game.
Today, India will play with Australia.
I'm telling the two players my good wishes.
Our population is 65 percent young generation.
And if we lose the world of the game, he's sorry.
A new revolution has been reported in the world of the game.
We can see that like cricket, India has grown interest in the games of soccer, hockey, tennis, Kabadi.
Today, I want to tell you my hopes by listening to a young man and a happy one.
You must have come to know that next year i.e. our country is organizing the 17th Flying Square in the year of Egypt.
24 teams from all over the world will come to India.
1951, the Asian Geography of 1962 won the golden treasure of India and India occupied the fourth position of the 1956 Olympic Games.
But unfortunately , in the last few decades we have come down continuously - we're going backwards.
Now we're so low in FIFI that we can't dare talk.
On the other hand, I see that the interest of the young generation of India is increasing.
Whether e-PL is a Spanish lilygy or a game of Indian Super League, the young generation of our country takes time to watch TV.
It's a matter of fact that the interest in the game is growing.
But when such a great opportunity comes to India, we'll only finish our responsibility by organizing it
Throughout this year, we can create a football-football environment.
In school, college, every corner of our country, our school boys sweat them.
Football games on four sides.
If I can do this, then the event will be enjoyed and that's why all of us should be tried to bring football to the village in the streets.
That's the same opportunity in the United States of FIF-17.
In this one year, we create a new excitement for footballs on all sides of youth.
We have one advantage of this event, we're gonna have a circuit here, and all the opportunities to play, must take care of it.
I'll enjoy it only when I can connect every young man with football.
Friends, I have a hope for you.
This event of Egypt, how will this opportunity be, what will be our plans for speeding football, what kind of propaganda, how to improve the present system, how to raise interest in the new generation game through Film Original-17 squares, how to connect with other social organizations at the government level, training institutes, and other social organizations to play.
We can see all this, but we have to bring these things in other games.
Football is a chance.
Can you advise me about this
I think it's a very funny retirement to enhance India's respect in front of the world.
I think it's a chance to meet India's young age.
What did I get at the time of the match, what did I do not mean - I can unite our own power, show strength, and branding in India.
Can you send your advice to Narendra Modi app
Logo will be like this, how will the slogan be, what should be done to enjoy this whole country, what theme will be, what sort of swuveniness can be made - Friends think, and I want each of my employers to be the ambassador of the Film-17 square of this UK.
You're all supposed to have a new identity in India.
My dear students must have thought about where to travel during the holiday.
There are few people who go abroad, most people go somewhere in their own kingdom for 5 days and 7 days.
Some people go out of the state.
In the past, I told you to upload the photo from wherever you don't go.
And I saw that the work that the tourist office, the culture office, the state government and the Indian government could not do, has made millions of tourists like this.
I've really enjoyed seeing the photographs of such a place.
We have to take this job forward.
You still do the same thing, but now write something with him - not just a photo.
If you have the power to write, display it and see a new place, there is a lot of opportunity to learn - that things we can't learn in the summit, which we cannot learn in our family, the things we can't learn from friends. Sometimes there is a lot of opportunity to learn through tourism and experience newness of the new place.
People, languages, eating and drinking, there is no chance to see how much more.
And he says - "A traveler without observation is a bird without wing".
If you want to see good things, you have to make sight.
India is a country full of variety.
Get out to see you once, watch your lifetime, watch.
Never mind.
And I'm lucky, I've got a lot of chance to travel.
When I wasn't the Chief Minister, I wasn't the Prime Minister, and I was a little older than you, I've traveled a lot.
I think there's no such district in India, where I didn't have a chance to go.
Tourism has a major role in creating life.
And now the young people of India are going to tour with courage, and are going to fetch the curiosity.
As before, they didn't go on the past, they wanted to do something new.
I believe it's a very good example.
Our young brave brave, they should be trying to reach where no one has a foot.
I want to thank Coal India in particular.
The Western Coalfield Limited has created an environmental "Khani Tourist Region" near Nagpur in Saon.
Ordinarily, people like us are thinking...
Then stay away.
When we see the pictures of the people there, we think it's good to go there.
And the word is that the hand is black in the coal, because the man goes away from the mine.
But that coal mine is built as a tourist center
And I'm glad that this is the beginning, so far more than ten thousand people have seen the environmental mine tourism center near Nagpur near Saon village.
This place gives you a chance to see new things.
I hope if you go out on holiday, you can do some work about cleanliness.
Nowadays, there's a thing that's going to be less or more, but it's going to be discussed.
Perhaps there's an intimidation, but there's a consciousness that came.
People are trying to maintain cleanliness in tourism sectors.
Tourists are also trying to do this.
They live permanently at the tourist centers, they are also joining this work.
Maybe it's not too scientific, but it's happening.
Can't you also give importance to the cleanliness of the tourism center as a tourist
My constant belief, our young friends must help in this matter.
And one thing is true is the highest income from tourism, the most poor people can roam from this area.
When tourists go somewhere to travel, they'll buy something if wealthy, the cost will be more.
So there's a lot of employment in tourism.
India is still far behind tourism in comparison to other countries of the world.
But if we think we have to strengthen our tourism, we must attract the world.
We can take a large part of the World Period.
And then it'll be possible to employ millions of new youths in our country.
Government, organizations, society or citizens, all have to do this.
Come on, we work for that.
My young friends, the vacations come and go - I don't like it.
Think about this.
Are you going to leave your holidays, the important years of life, these moments of importance
How many things I'm talking about - you can think.
Can't you summon any further increases with your personality on this holiday
If you don't know swimming, you can swim on holidays.
If you don't know how to drive a bike, learn to drive a bike in the holidays.
I'm still tapping a computer in two fingers.
We don't have any tricks to develop our personality.
Or I'm gonna remove our deficiencies.
We're gonna enhance our strength.
Think, it's not a big class that requires a trainer, a bigger fizz or a bigger budget.
Watch around you if you think - you can make something excellent from the things you dropped - then start it, look how happy you will find.
At the end of the day, look at what you made from the Jungle.
Your picture has a hobby, but you can't draw pictures. Don't start, it'll be right.
For the development of your personality at the time of the holiday, do something to increase your power, skill.
Not only those areas I've spoken, but there's a chance to do more.
Because of this, your personality, how much your self-confidence will grow - see.
At the end of the holiday, when you go back to school or college, and tell your friends - Brother, I learned this in the holiday.
Look, if they don't learn anything, you're gonna think, this way, I'm ruined.
You're very smart, you've learned something.
We're gonna talk about it among friends.
I'm sure you must do something and tell me what you learned.
What do you mean
There are some suggestions on the portal 'My Gave' for the 'Man Ki Waat' of this time.
Like... my name is Abhi Charvedi.
Namskar, Prime Minister, you said last summer holidays, birds are hot.
We need to keep the balcony or the roof filled with water in a pot.
From where the birds can come and drink water.
I've enjoyed doing this.
I've been friends with many birds at this time.
My request, you repeat this thing in the "Man What Walt".
Thank you
"My dear countrymen, I want to tell this boy my gratefulness by the name of Abhi Charvedi.
He reminded me of a good job.
Last time I remembered.
And so I told you to keep the birds water on the ground out of the house in the summer.
Accused told me that he's been doing this whole year and many birds have become friends.
The great poet of Hindi, Mahadevi Burma loved birds.
He wrote in his poem: "Don't let you go away, I'll fill up the silver, fill the sweet sweet water.
"Come on, this thing of Mahadevi's work.
I'm congratulating the accused, I'm also grateful. You remind me very important.
From Mahishura, Shila Cook has taken a very sensitive matter for all of us.
He said, there's a milkman near our house, a newspaper, a postman.
Sometimes they're dressed, dressed and sold.
Did we ever ask them to drink their water in the summer, ever give them water
Shilla, I'm specially grateful to you.
Because you've taken a very sensitive thing very easy.
That's the right thing.
It's very simple, but if the postman comes to the house during summer, and we'll feed him, how good he likes
But this is the tradition of India.
But Shilla, I'm grateful.
Because you aimed at this thing.
My dear farmer brothers, you've heard a lot about digital India.
Some people think Digital India is the world of young people of the city
But no, you're glad to hear that a 'kisson facility app' has been prepared for all of you.
If you're downloading this app on your mobile phone, many information about agriculture and weather will come to you.
What's the situation in the market, what's the situation of Pickery Bazar, how good yields, suitable medicines, etc. are the many things in this app.
Not only that, it has a button that can be connected directly to agricultural scientists.
And if you put any questions in front of them, they will answer him and give you information.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters will download this 'Kissan facility app' to their mobile phone.
Try and see if it's working for you.
If there is any problem, you can complain to me.
My farmer brothers and sisters, others mean summer holidays at rest.
But it's more sweating for the farmers.
They waited for the rains and tried to make their own fields before the rains, so that one drop of rain water would not be destroyed.
It's very important for the farmers to start farming.
But our countrymen have to think about how to run without water
If we stop leaving the dirty jungle in our own area, the way to water, the way to fill the water in the pond, then the water supply will be reduced by the stoppage of water.
Can't we open those old places once again, clean up, so that more water can be transmitted
As much as water is saved.
If the water is saved in the first rain, the pond will be filled, the rivers and the rivers will be filled and the rain will be reduced.
Now you may have seen the effort to build a pond of 5 lakhs of ponds and farming grounds.
Under the 'Manrega' project, water conservation has been forced to generate resources.
Provide your plans, how to save water in the village, how to save every drop of rain, to live in the village water village - how to start this awareness campaign.
You will be involved in this various governmental plan, in order to create a massive movement for the importance and conservation of water.
There are so many villages in the country, there are many progressive farmers, many conscious citizens, who are doing this.
But we have to go further.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to talk to you more.
A few days ago, the Government of India organized a big agricultural fair.
I saw how many modern technologies have come and how many changes have been made in agriculture.
But these technologies have to reach the farmers' fields.
And now the farmers are saying, the use of chemical serums has to be reduced.
I'm congratulating like this.
The excessive use of chemical serpent has made our mother sick.
We're the mother of the earth.
We don't want to keep our mother sick.
Good spicy if it's cooked, it's good cooking.
But if good spices are given in more quantity, what's it better to eat
I don't like eating it
The use of chemical serpents is exactly the same.
Whatever good sir is, the use of these serpents will be a cause of harm.
Each thing needs to be used as necessary.
It also costs less, saves the money.
I don't think, less cost-more output... we have to follow this policy.
With scientific methods, we have to carry forward agriculture.
It's just 1-2 months left for rainy season.
I hope I can complete this work with full care of what is necessary for water conservation.
As much as the water survives, the farmers will get the benefit and the same life will survive.
My dear countrymen, April 7th is the World Health Day.
This year the theme of World Health Day is ' Beat Diabetes ' in the world .
That's why you're gonna lose diabetes.
Diabetes is a disease that brings all other diseases.
Once someone has diabetes, many sick guests enter their home, body.
According to the statistics, in 1950, there were six and a half million diabetes patients in our country.
Three percent of the deaths are diabetes.
Diabetes two types - type 1 and type 2.
Type 1 is genetic, parents, there is a possibility of children.
And the reason for Type 2 is bad behavior, old and extra weight.
We're bringing them back.
The whole world is worried about diabetes.
That's why the 7th World Health Day is Diabetes.
We all know, the biggest reason for diabetes is our lifestyle.
Cyc work is going down.
There's no name and smell of sweat.
Don't walk.
We're playing the game online.
Nothing's happening in the offline.
Can't we make any changes in our lifestyle to absorb diabetes with the inspiration of 7th
If you are interested in yoga then do yoga.
Or run at least.
If every citizen of our country is healthy, then India will be healthy.
Sometimes we don't have medical checkups.
And then when the situation is very complicated, we think we're an old patient of diabetes.
There's no problem testing
You can do this.
And now it's easy to have all the opportunities.
You must think about it.
The 'Jakshma Day' is in the world on March 24.
When I was a little, I was scared to hear the name of the tuberculosis.
I thought death was shire.
But now the tuberculosis is not a cause of fear.
Because now everyone knows that the treatment of tuberculosis is possible and it can be easily cured.
But when the tuberculosis died, we were scared.
But now we don't care about tuberculosis.
Compared to the whole world, the number of tuberculosis patients in our country is very high.
If you have to get rid of tuberculosis, you need proper treatment and cervical treatment.
We need proper and complete treatment.
Leave the treatment in the middle, new problems.
Tumor is a disease that everyone around knows, they can also advise to check-up.
If there is cough, there is fever, the weight decreases, then the people around may doubt whether the person has a tuberculosis.
It means it's a disease that needs to be tested quickly.
My dear countrymen, there's a lot of work on this.
There are more than 13,500 microscope centers.
There are more than four lakh DOTs providers.
There are many modern tests and Esmast services are available free.
You can get a check and get rid of this disease.
Take proper treatment and continue treatment until the disease is finished.
I'm gonna request you, tuberculosis or diabetes. We have to defeat them.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But it's not gonna be government, doctors, medicines until you come forward.
And that's why I request the countrymen today, come, wear diabetes and get rid of the tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, there's a lot of important days in April.
Especially on 14th April, Babasaheb Bhimrao's birthday.
His 125th birth-generation has fled all over the country.
A 'Mahu' of Panchthirth is his birthplace.
Her studies in London.
Diksha in Nagpur.
26, Alipur Road, in Delhi, there was a great sacrifice and in Mumbai, where his funeral took place, we are constantly trying to improve this five pilgrimage.
I'm lucky that this year, on 14th April, the priest of Babasaheb Ambadkar will be lucky to go to Mahu.
Babasaheb has given us a lot to be a country's responsible citizen.
Following that path, we can give him the greatest admiration to become a country's responsible citizen.
A few days later, Vikram is starting.
The new Vikram will come.
In different states, this festival is run by different names.
Someone calls it a navel, some "gudi-proba", some "born ancestor", somebody else called "Ugadi".
But almost everywhere in India it runs.
My greatest congratulations for the New Year.
You know, I told you last time that my 'Man What Walt' program will be able to hear at your phone sometime in about 20 languages.
You just have to call a missed call.
This facility has just been one month, and I'm glad that about 35 lakh people have benefited from it.
You write the number - 81908 81908.
I repeat, 81908 81908.
You call Missed, and when you're facilitated, you'll hear the Old "Man Ki Baat" program.
I'm glad to join you.
My dear countrymen, you all have a lot of congratulations
Thank you very much
.
