Her father, Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur, after her life, Guru Gobind Singh had established the status of Guru at the youngest 9 years of age.
Guru Gobind Singh, who was supposed to fight for justice, got him from the Sikh Gurus.
He was a darkness of peace and simple qualities
But whenever there were attempts to ruin the voices of weak people, they were forced against them, then Guru Gobind Singh gave a hug to the evils, weak people, fought firmly with his shoulders, hence he says: Sawa Laxe Ak Ladawum, Siddio Son Mine Bazda Doom, Thabe Kobindsing, Nama Kahawum.
He'll say he can't express his power to those who are foolish.

In this series this organization is engaged in encouraging safe , healthy food habits .
At Right India, healthy and Indian pilgrimages are being carried out through the regular conduct of India .
This operation continues till 27th of January.
Sometimes the government's structures are marked by discovering.
But FSSAI appreciates it's coming through the leadership of people awareness, public education.
When India is clean, it's healthy, then it's yourself.
The most important requirement for good health is nutritious diet .
In this case, I'm demonstrating my favourite appreciation for the FSSAI formation to make such an effort.
Please ask if you want to join this side of yourself.
I'm also asking you to join it, show them to children.
The knowledge about the importance of food is important since childhood.
