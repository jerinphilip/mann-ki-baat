Man Ki Bath, New Year 2017, greet my dear countrymen.
A few years ago, I got a chance to communicate with the kids from Karnataka.
In a program organized by the Times Group of Vijay Karnataka, the Prime Minister of the country, he requested the children to write a letter.
And they published the selected letters.
I felt very happy when I read those letters.
These little kids know the problems of the country.
They know about the discussions in the country.
Children wrote about many things.
Kirti Hegde from the northern bank...
Digital India, congratulating Smart City plans, the child says that there is a change in our educational system.
The children of this time don't like classroom redding, and that kid tells them what they want to know about nature.
If we give the children the knowledge of nature, perhaps it will do greatly in the future for the protection of the environment.
A child named Rida Nadaf from the place named Laxmeshwar is proud of her being the daughter of a soldier.
Any Indian who is not proud of our soldiers
And it's natural to be proud of the soldier's daughter.
Irfan Baigam from Kalburgi has written that the school is 5 kilometers away from home, so it's time to get out of the house, it's late to return home.
So he says he can't spend time with friends.
The boy says he wants to be a nearby school.
But I loved the paperwork that I needed to send them to me, so I could read those letters.
I've had a good experience.
Dear people, today's 2611.
It's our regime dated November 26.
This is the day in 1949 that the Construction Church agreed to the constitution of India.
The administration came into existence on January 26, 1950, so we celebrated the mathematical day i.e. Republic Day.
The constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is the day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They slaughtered for nearly three years to build the Constitution of India.
Those who read about this discussion will feel proud of what the thinking of the people dedicated to the nation.
Can we imagine how hard they worked to build our country's constitution with diversity
When the country gets rid of the slavery chain, how long they'll be demonstrated.
In the light of this constitution, it is our responsibility to build a new India in the light of the thoughts of those great men.
Our regime is very big.
It's not an area of unexpected life, but there's no subject in nature.
Equality and compassion for everyone is the face of our constitution.
Although all citizens, poverty, mortgages, but the rights are disarmed, even tribals...
Watching all the fundamental rights, protecting their Hiddens.
It's our duty to follow the authority.
In spite of being a citizen, the ruler must move forward with the emotion of the Constitution.
The message of our constitution is that no one should be hurt.
Today, on the occasion of the rule day, Dr.
It's natural to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
17 different committees were formed based on important topics in this Constituent Assembly.
One of the most important committees was a drafting committee.
Dr.
Baba Saheb was the President of the Drafting Committee of the Ambedkar Administration.
He had a great share.
Today, we are proud of any government of India, in its design, the majesty of the leadership of Baba Saheb Ambedkar has fallen.
He promised to be good for all sections of the society.
On December 6, on the day of his greatness, we remember him and remember him regularly.
Baba Saheb's contribution to making the country rich and strong is unmarried.
On December 15, Sardar is the birthday of Vallabhbhai Patel.
Sardar Patel turned into a humiliating country from the farmer's son.
He had an extraordinary right to corner a square in the country.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Construction Church.
He was the president of the advisory committees created for fundamental rights, mausoletic rights, neighbourhood and tribal welfare.
2611 is our regime.
But how can we forget the 26-11 militants surpassed the attack on Mumbai
The brave citizens and the police and the security personnel remember all those who lost their lives and destroy them.
This country will never forget their sacrifice.
The horrificism is taking a miraculous look at the day-to-day event everywhere in the world today.
We have been suffering from terrorism in India for the past 40 years.
Thousands of innocent people lost their lives.
But a few years ago, when India talked about terrorism in front of the world, many people in the world were not ready to take it seriously when they discussed the terrible threat of terrorism.
And when the horrificism engages in their own doors, every government in the world believes in manifestation, all governments believe in democracy seem to be a big challenge for terrorism.
Consciousness challenges the manifestation of the world.
Terrorism has been challenging human rights.
It's supposed to deteriorate human powers.
Therefore, not only India, but all the human powers in the world must defeat terrorism together.
This is the world's message of Ahimsa and Love through Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi.
Terrorism and intimidation tries to weaken our social relations.
So it's time to be more vigilant for human powers.
My dear countrymen, we all celebrate Navy Day on December.
Indian Navy protects our sea shore.
I wish all the people associated with the Navy.
You all know that our culture grew in the river banks.
Though Sindhu, the Ganges, the Yamuna, the Saraswati, our rivers and the oceans are important in strategic and strategic vision.
These are our doors to the world.
This country has an inexplicable relationship with our land, the ocean.
When we look into history, 800-900 years ago, the Chola Navy was considered as the most powerful navigator army.
In the growth of the Cholasam kingdom, their navigators had a great role in making them the economic power of the time.
Several examples of the movements and investigations of the Chola Navigation can be seen in conflict.
Lots of people know that most of the navigational forces in the world were granted to women in warships for a long time.
But in the Chola Navy, more than 800-900 years ago, many women participated.
Women were also involved in the war.
The Chola rulers knew the construction of the ship.
When we talk about the Navy, he will forget the wild empowerment of making Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as a navigator.
Konkan beach was in the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurga, Murud Janjira, Golden Fort related to Shivaji Maharaj were once on the seashore or surrounded by sea.
Maratha was the Navy's army waiting for the safety of these forts.
There were big ships and small boats in the Maratha Navy.
Their Navy was very capable of protecting the country from any enemy and the enemy.
How don't we remember Canhoji Angre when we talk about Maratha Navy
He brought the Maratha Navik Sena to a new head and made the headquarters of the Maratha Navik Sena in many places.
After independence, our Indian navigational forces, despite the advancement of Goa in various occasions, showed their traditions in the Indian Pakistan war in 1971.
The war is in our eyes when we speak of the Navy, but the navigators of India have come forward with so much enthusiasm.
This year, in the month of June, when the peacock wrecked in Bangladesh and Myanmar, our Navy's I.
My.
S.
Sumitra's ship helped save people and handed over many people who were involved in fishing safely to Bangladesh.
This year, when there was a huge flood in Sri Lanka in May-June, three ships of our Navy arrived and helped the government and the people.
In September in Bangladesh, the ship I of our Navy in Rohinggya.
My.
S.
Ghadiya has brought magic help.
In the month of June, when the government of Papwa New Gina gave a threat, our navigators helped rescue the fisheries of their fisheries.
On November 21, when a trade market was looted at West Gulf, INS came to Tricond for help.
Even if it is possible to provide health services to Fuji, the neighboring country has been doing a prideful job to get magic help at the time of the accident.
We Indians are always proud of our security forces and respectful to them.
Though it's a brave army, even a wire force...
In the name of our daring, courage, courage, transgression and sacrifice, all the Indians finish them.
They sacrifice their youth for the country to live peacefully for a hundred and fifty people.
Every year on December 7, the Karsena flag is celebrated.
It's a day to proud of the country's soldiers and show respect to them.
I'm glad that the Defense Ministry has decided to organize a program from 1st December to 7th.
It's a program to facilitate people and consciously facilitate people about civil war soldiers.
Wear a flag every week, children and adults.
In the country, there must be a precedent of respect for the army.
On this occasion, armed forces can distribute flags.
The experiences of introductory soldiers, courageous activities, video and pictures related to them, Armed Forcesflagday (Hashtag and Forces Flag Day).
Calling soldiers in schools and colleges, they can get information about the army.
Our new generation can change it as a good opportunity to get information about the army.
This opportunity is to provide funds for all the soldiers of our armed forces.
This wealth is used to rehabilitate the families of the heroes obtained in the war through the Military Welfare Board for the help of wounded soldiers.
KSB on various ways to provide financial assistance.
Geovi.
In (ksb.
Gov.
In) Information is available.
Cashless payment can also be done.
Come on, let's do some of our armed forces in this situation.
Let's give us our contribution to their goodness.
My dear countrymen, December 5 is the soil day of the world.
World Soil Day.
I'd like to say something to our peasant brothers.
The soil is a great part of the earth.
Everything we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the food chain is connected to soil.
Imagine what happens if there is no soil in this world.
I'm afraid of thinking.
If there is no soil, plants and trees don't sprout, but how can man live
How's the animals
Our culture has already thought about it.
So we are aware of the importance of soil since ancient times.
On one side of our culture, there is a natural effort to possess the land, to the soil, to be devotional and gratitude.
On the other hand, the scientific methods for nutrition of soil were part of life.
In the life of the farmers of this country two things were important - devotion to soil and scientific treatment of soil .
The farmers of our country are related to tradition, and are interested in modern science, and we are very sure to take reasonable decisions.
I heard about the farmers of Tehu village in Bhorund block of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Here the farmers used chemicals in an unbalanced manner before.
So the health of the Earth was lost.
The catastrophe is low, so the income is low.
The productivity of the soil slowed down.
Some farmers in the village understood the surroundings of this situation and observed the advice of how many chemicals, other cloths, micro neutrients should be given to their bio-geography.
You will be surprised to hear what happened due to the information received from the health of the soil.
In 2016-17, the production of wheat in the Rabi cultivation took place from three to fourteen acres.
The income increased from four thousand to six thousand rupees.
And the qualities of soil increased.
The use of chemicals has profited financially.
I'm very happy that my peasant brothers are enjoying their enthusiasm as they get better results than following the advice given in the healthcare of the soil.
If you want to think about the crop, then the farmers will feel that the land will be waiting for us if you want to think about the Earth first.
As well as knowing the soil, our farmers have made more than 10 million soil health cards in the country.
We are devoted to the Great, but have you thought how much harm the health of the Great as well as the chemicals like Europe
It has been proved in all kinds of scientific methods that the Grandfather gets serious damage due to the use of more urea.
Farmers are genuine boys, but how can they see the earth as sick
It's time to wake up the maternal grandfather again.
Our farmers can make a decision to our sons of soil that we use 75 years of independence in 2022, half of the Europeans used in the field today
Children of the Earth, if my peasants take such a decision, the health of the Earth will improve, the productivity will increase.
The farmer's life begins to change.
We've started feeling global warmth and weather changes.
There was a time before Deepawali starts cold.
Now it's the beginning of December, the cold has slowly turned back.
But as soon as the cold begins, our experience is that we'll be foolish to come out of the blanket.
But in such a weather, people who are constantly alert will be inspired by us what is the result.
You'll be surprised when you hear.
The eight-year-old Divyanga Balan of Madhya Pradesh took the responsibility to free Tushar from the excavation.
Such a huge job, such a little boy.
But the excitement and the vision were twice, brutal, strong.
The 8-year-old boy, who didn't speak, made Visil his weapon.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, climbing into the village, whistling people, enjoying them and teaching them not to pour stool in the open space.
This child who went to 30-40 houses every day taught about purifying, Kumhari village was free from external excavation.
The little boy Tushar inspired about promoting purifying.
It's not an age for purifying, it's not limited.
Everyone needs purifyance, everybody has to do anything for purity, whether it is a child or adult, but a man or a woman.
Our divine brothers are obsessive, capable, brave.
We'll learn something for a minute.
Today they work well everywhere.
Sports is not behind any of our divine people, even in any competition, any social resistance.
Our divine sportsman Rio Olympics obtained 4 medals showing good performance, you remember the blind's T20 Cricket in the World Cup.
There are various types of competitions in the country.
Last day, the 16th National Para Swimming competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young divine brothers, who came from different parts of the country, participated in this and displayed their hypothesis.
One of them is Jigar Taker from Gujarat.
There are no muscles on 80 percent of his body.
But his courage and vision is worth seeing.
80 percent muscles have 11 metals.
He had achieved gold in the 17th National Para Swimming competition.
He chose Sports Authority of India 2020 Paralibiques as a consequence of his nipunya.
He is one of the 32 Para Swimmers trained in the Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar.
My salaam for Jigar Thakur...
I'm gonna enjoy him.
Today, Divyanagar can reach any area, special attention is on the occasion.
Our effort is to make everybody capable of the country.
Everyone has to become a society involved.
Equality and mentality must increase the equation in society, together.
Id-e-Milad-Un-Naby will be celebrated a few days later.
Prophet Hazrat Muhammad Saheb was born on this day.
All the people of the country are happy with my heart.
This celebration of Eid can inspire us to enhance peace and harmony in society, to enhance new energy, for new determinations.
(Phonecole) Prime Minister Namaste, I speak from Canpore to Sweja Singh.
I have a request for you.
This year, you have to share the best ten things in Man Kee Bay once more.
We'll remember those things, and we'll get something to learn.
Thank you.
(Phone column ends) It's true.
2017 ends, 2018 doors.
This suggestion is very good.
But I guess to make some difference with this suggestion.
Old people in our village will always say.
Forget sorrows, don't forget happiness.
Forget grief, do not forget comfort.
We have to inspire this thing.
We'll be able to enter in 2018, determining our best.
In our country, perhaps when the world's year is counted, observations, remarks, plans for a new year.
In our country, the media will try to remind many funny events of the past year.
There will be goodness and evil.
But I don't think I'm going to enter the best thing in 2018.
I'll give you a suggestion.
If you're all heard and experienced, the others know that they'll find a good feeling of 5-10.
Can't you assure your share in this
This time, five good things in life will be shared with others.
Though it's in the form of a small story, it's good as a small video.
We need to welcome in a good atmosphere on 2018.
I need good luck.
We need good thoughts.
Remember good things...
Come on.
In the Narendramodi App, in MGOV or in the social media, the good things can be shared in the Positive India.
Remember events inspiring the others.
It'll be a good idea to remember good things.
It'll enable you to do good things.
Good luck, good luck.
Good sympathies lead to good results.
Come on.
Let's try this time for Positive India.
Look, we'll welcome the year we created positive acceleration together.
We can unite the strength of this mixed form and its consequences.
I will surely try to bring your Hashtag Positive India to the people in the next Man Key Bay.
My dear countrymen, next month, you'll be back to your next Man Kee Ba.
There's a lot of chance to say.
Thank you very much.
