The voice of the mind, the folks of November 2018, salvation.
On the third day of October, 2014, on the third day of the day of Vijaya Samith, we traveled together through the voice of the heart.
The 50th part of this journey called the voice of the heart is filled with it .
That's how the Gold Festival is today.
This way most of your letters, phone works, are related to this 50th part.
In MyGov, Delhi's Anshu Kumar, Amar Kumar, Patna's Vicas Yadav, NarendermodiAp, Delhi-based Monica Jean, West Bengali Parthwaan, Sankeeta Sastri, accompanied by Nagpur, have gathered the same kind of information.
What do they say, the latest technology, social network, the prime minister, who has been able to communicate with the people of time in the use of mobile activity, chose the radio
I'm asking you.
It's okay you're gonna wake up.
Your interest is natural.
In today's times, almost in the event of the radio, why do you communicate with the motorcycle
That's your question.
I'd like to tell you about a chance.
It happened in 1998.
I've been administering the Indian National Party in Himachal Pradesh.
I was going to a place in the month of May.
In the areas of Himachal Pradesh it starts getting cold in the evening itself.
I'm staying for tea in the tea market.
It was a very good shop, only one of them was selling tea.
He didn't even wear the fair, he was selling in a very small vehicle on the roadside.
He used to take a ladder kept in a silver vessel and eat a lot of ladder first before leaving tea.
I'm surprised, because, what happened to anyone in the house, like marriage.
No, you don't know.
He told me that it was a very funny thing.
I'm telling you what happened to him, the joy and happiness he had.
Damn, it was meant to be the successful Church of India's explosive test.
I'm really supposed to do it.
That's the fucking guy, the first one is listening to the radio.
Then he was talking about it in the radio.
It was the day that the nuclear test was successful, when he was the former Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Wazbei, he knew the nutritions.
It's only this knowledge that he was busy listening to the fun and enjoying himself.
In this jungle, in such a narrow area, snowy mountains, a common man, selling his own tea, asking for a whole day's translation.
Everything was deepened in my mind when I saw the news that he was affecting the mind...
..
.
I mean, I realized that the radical man is two times.
Target for information surveys, and its deepness is that the radiation is full of smoothness in my mind, its swelling could be filled up.
That's why I'm not surprised to return my attention to the prime minister's milk of the most powerful radiation.
If I accept the responsibility of a Prime Minister in the month of May 2014, the responsibility of the country, its valour, its valour, India's genius, our cultural genius, the good data spread on the nerves of our society, the people's sides, chickens, fascinations and sacrifices.
To the remote villages of the country, the farmers started, brought them to the small business scholars, enjoyed the voice of the mind.
Every month lakhs of letters were read, phones were heard, actions and myGov were conveyed.
The journey of these 50 portions, which have been given in a comfortable manner, connected with this trip to us.
At present, India's radiography has also done research on the voice of the mind.
Some of the backgrounds found in them are very comfortable.
70 percent of those who have been tested are constantly asking for a voice of mind .
The people of the mind believe that there is a creative emotion in the society, the greatest participants of the mind.
A large number of people have been illustrated by the voice of the heart.
Andiopositive has been debated extensively.
All these show artificial joy in the minds of our folk folks the genuine feelings.
People are worried about their feelings that the voice of the mind has increased.
The idea that people should be engaged in social service is a major change in their mind.
Due to the voices of the mind, it gives me the pleasure of changing the radiation of people's favorite publicity.
But people don't just agree with this program.
In addition to TV, F. Ambanoli, mobile, combination, basket straight sound, barriscope, and through the NARENDRAMODI function, the people of the heart come to share their share.
Religiously on the voice of the mind, I'm supposed to describe all the friends of the voice family of the mind to change it.
(CHUCKLES CONTINUES) Appropriate Prime Minister, they say.
My name is Shalini, I'm talking to Itherapad.
It's the voice of the mind that's a lot of people's program.
Initially, all the contents awakened by the political scenes.
But when this event continues, it was based on social problems, savaals, etc. in place of the kingdom, in that way there were colors related to millions of people like me.
Slowly smooth immersions began to tease.
My question is, how did you see this event to be removed from the prince
Can you use it politically if you don't appear or you don't think you should list your government's tests
Thank you.
Thank you for your call.
Your understanding is okay.
If a man gets mic, millions of people ask, what else
Some young people also conducted a study of all the things that came to the church of the mind.
They've studied how many ways they used to talk about all the other parts.
Studies that what's been used again.
At the end of his study, this event was also an end without the political structure.
When the mind begins to shout, it doesn't matter politically, the government shouldn't stick to the back, but it shouldn't be a rope anywhere.
I've got all the qualities, the excitement that I need to fulfil this decision.
It is clear that everybody's letters coming before the chord, symptoms, phone calls, etc. are visible by the eyes of the neurons.
Crazy comes, goes, but this country stands in a state of existence, destroys our culture.
130 million folks don't hide my little stories.
The new prediction, the new peaks of the excitement are guiding this congress.
I'm very surprised to get back to myself, too.
Somebody writes that we don't want to speak much off with newspapers, small shopkeepers, auto drivers, vegetable sellers.
I'm supposed to have a letter, if this argument appeared in another letter, I'll take it with it.
And I'll share my experience, and I'll share with you.
I don't know when it's going home and family, but it's roaming around social surroundings, Wattsup, leading a change.
The things you sent about sanctity, events and examples of human beings, makes every house a small piece of sanctity, and those who live in the house are aware, sometimes the Prime Minister's supplications are produced by negotiating.
Celphy's campaign started in a small village of chicken, even when it spread across the country, it cannot be a prince, acquainted with all this.
When every section of the society, when it is incorporated, in a new prophecy of social change, it understands this guidance, makes the eye unknowing awareness.
Sometimes the voice of the mind begins to grow, so that 130 million people live in my mind.
They're all my mind.
The voice of the mind is not official.
It's a social matter.
The voice of the mind, the neighbourhood of India, the great lucky India.
The Andraman of India is not political.
Not even the power of the Andramas government of India.
India's Anthramanma society is about social power.
There are thousands of segments of social life, one of them is irregular.
If the prince is all, it's not a good organisation for a healthy community.
Sometimes the political affairs and the masses are provoking at any level, the other social capabilities, other attempts are ruined.
For the bright future of a nation like India, it is our social responsibility.
The voice of the mind is a simple, working effort towards this direction.
(CHUCKLES CONTINUES) He's the Prime Minister
I'm speaking protema Mugharji from Mumbai.
Sir, every part of the mind's hoove is full of deep illness, information, genuine probability, good activity of human beings.
I know what kind of products you're engaged before every event.
Thanks for your phone call.
Somehow it's been heard because of your sword.
Not to the Prime Minister, I think you're asking a sweet friend you're the biggest success of 50 parts of the church of the mind.
It's yourself public.
If I answer directly to the question you asked, I don't care about any manufacturing muscle.
Actually, it's the voice of the mind, that's the easiest job for me.
People's letters are coming before everybody's hole.
MyGov and the Narendramodi Mobile activity are supposed to share your ideas, ideas, and the 1800117800, in which people contact your messages are booked in the horoscope.
My intention is to invite a lot of letters and ideas before the cheek of the mind.
To come closer to the voice of the mind, to travel, to read the messages and instructions you sent.
Every கண is my folk people, my mind is singing.
So, whenever he reads a letter, his letter writer's position, his favourite composition is like a green potato.
That letter isn't just a paper on me.
In fact, for just 40-45 years I've lived a saint's life, have reached most of the villages of the country, spending a long time in remote districts of the country.
And, because of this, when there's a bit of time, that place, environment, can see me in a natural way.
After this I'll keep things like the village, the name of the person.
If you want to tell the truth, in the voice of the mind, my voice is myself, but all the specimens, emotions, feelings, things of my folks.
I'm trying to see me everybody who's lucky in the cheek of the mind.
The names of millions of such people haven't been able to tell me in the cheeks of the mind till now, but not all these, your letters, come to mess up your views.
Your thoughts, your feelings are very important to my life.
Your ideas come to me more than ever before, to make me feel comfortable and comfortable, and terrible, and to be part of your ideas.
Any letters that don't appear in the cheeks of the mind, those letters, visions, and efforts are being made to make related departments.
I'd like to demonstrate al-IndiaRadio, FM Radio, Dhurdharshan, other TVs, social networks to my friends.
With their efforts, the voice of the mind goes to the other people.
The team of Al-India Radio sings every part of the mind's voice in many languages.
Some in the most important state languages, in the hole of the thief, the same tail gives a hole to the mind.
That way they finish as Narendra for 30 minutes.
I'm supposed to appreciate them all the talents, skills and thanks.
And I'd like to leave you, that's what you must hear this event in your state languages.
I'd like to describe my heartfelt thanks to friends in the public sector.
They've been continuously experimenting the monkey in their channels.
There's always no joy in any archaeologist's publicity, it's the most guaranteed guarantee, that's all that's negative.
But you have made yourself the variety of things raised in the church of the mind.
Sanitation, road safety, intoxication, India, and multiple sympathies with a selective sympathy, have been working to change it as a drive.
Television channels made it a very careful event.
I'm supposed to convey my life to the public.
If you don't have a fight, the journey of the bravery of the mind would have been uncomfortable.
(CHUCKLES CONTINUES-3) They're the ones
I'm talking about the finance from Northern Mussoorie.
I'm mother of two young men.
I'm often seeing what they're gonna say isn't like kids of this age.
It doesn't mean anybody's thinking, as a teachers, parents.
But when you tell a thing in the church of the mind, they understand it, they're doing it.
Can you afford your secrets a little
That's what you're talking or talking about, tell me how they understand it properly.
Thank you.
Thank you for your phone call, they're the finance.
I don't have any secret to tell the truth.
I think I'm gonna be walking in all families so much.
If you want to speak in a simple language, I'm trying to see me from inside those youngsters.
Looking at me in his environment, I'm supposed to compose a wavelength with his thoughts.
It's easier to understand anyone until we don't control the filth of our lives.
Sometimes our structures make a lot of confluence.
Meaning is the first thing to understand without any negative, negative.
In such a way, the virus who are opponents of our opponents will foil in our ideas unforgettable to comfort us.
That's why it's a difference of information, in a way, both of them are compassionate.
Whenever, let's go both of them know how a man took away his opinion and accepted other characters.
The importance of today's small community, they don't have to do anything until you have faith.
But if you're supposed to have a friendship with one, you're gonna get rid of something to do it.
In many cases, the elders in the family are also talking about the difference in information.
In fact, most of the developing seasonal people have to talk about it.
Most of the things related to studies or practices or lifestyle, so that you don't do it, talk to open mind, gradually reduce families, it's a matter of concern.
In place of neighbourhood, recommendation instead of disappearance, only when talking is done.
I'm always trying to keep the youth constantly waiting through social networks for the future events.
I'm always trying to find out what they say or what they think.
They'll always bury the carriages with them.
They are usually empowered, renewed, consistent.
Through the voice of the mind, I'm coming to give more importance to the efforts of the people.
Many times it is said that most of the questions are heard.
It's good for you to wake up youngsters
I mean why it's a good thing, they're going to study all things with roots.
Some say it's not yourself to the youth.
But I don't think it's time for young people to roam.
This thing helps today's younger generation to inflict more freshness, because they think they're finished.
We know that today's young people are more skilled, big things.
Well, with great dreams, they gained big successes.
It's yourself new India
Some say that young guys, they're gonna do many things at the same time.
I'm listening, can you miss it
At the same time, the guys do many works, so.
If we give our vision around us, it's social business, stored guys, sports, other sectors, young people who make big differences in society.
These youngsters, windows, have been able to see dreams.
If we stand the ideas of the people on the ground, give them a free environment to shape them, we can make a major change in the country.
They're coming to do that.
My favorite folks, from Gurugrom, they're gov, you're in the church of the mind, that's the 26th of November, you're gonna have to talk about the Capital Law every day.
If what's important on this day, we're supposed to accept our capital in 70 years and he's booked.
Vinita they are, thanks for your advice.
Yeah, tomorrow's legislation.
It's every day we think we've given us the law of capitalists.
On the 26th day of November, 1949, our capital legislation was accepted.
The Cabinet Committee, 2 years, 11 months, 17 days to complete the financial work that was made up to the capital law.
See, imagine, within 3 years, these miracles have embraced such a wide, deep administrative legislation.
They're an example of arrogance, even today, time administration and productivity, creating legislation.
We also pretend to fulfil our responsibilities at the time of adventure.
The capital was the confluence of these monks.
From that, everybody, the people of India, should be powerful, self-reserving, with the favour of giving you a monarchy law to yourself.
The importance of our capital legislation is that it has been explained in detail about rights and commitments.
In the life of the citizens, when both of them are sweet, the nation moves forward.
If we value the rights of others, our rights were defended by itself.
Likewise, if we finish the debts enforced in the law of the capital, our rights will be protected automatically.
I still have a green dream that happened in the year 2010.
Then on the 60th day of the state of India, I had arranged to take our capital legislation in Gujarat and take it to the elephant.
Recognize the awareness of the law in the youth, connecting them with the various factors of the capital legislation, which is the possibility of a reminding.
In 2020, as a ruler, we're completing our 70 years, we've spent 75 years of independence in the year 2022.
Come on, let's go ahead with our capital legislation, piece, progress, peace, development, prosperity in our country.
My favorite folks, if you talk about the Banner's Celebration, don't forget that monastery confluence center of the Celebration.
That magnificent is the salvation tactor.
Baba Saheb Ambethaker.
The 6th day of December is his Mahabari Nirvana day that he is the day of Amarnath.
The folks, in everybody's affairs, make Baba Saheb see my uncle.
He acquired the right to live with millions of Indians.
Popular vision is one of Baba Saheb's nature.
He says that the Great Jews of India were not dead from outside.
What's Jeanney, what's the judicial system, isn't the new thing to the Indian country.
He sent an emotional request at the Cell of the Corps... to defend the freedom that has been received after all these conflicts, we'd beat us until our last slaughter is blood.
Indians, even though we are dependent on various laterals, all matters must be done before the folk world.
India First is the first to India, Dr.
Baba Saheb was the root of Ambethagar.
My favourite priests to Baba Saheb, one of the other tricks.
My folk folks, two days ago, on the 23rd day of the month of November, Kurunank Dev was celebrated on their birthday.
Next year, in 2019, we're celebrating his 550th birthday.
Guru Nanak Dev had ever saddened about human society.
He ever pushed the path of social liberty, assignment, service, bribery, brotherhood.
The next year the country is celebrated with the 550th birthday of Guru Nanak Dev .
It's light, not our country, but all the countries of the world.
All the State Departments, Union Territories, have also been asked for the most specialization of this country.
Like this, the 550th birthday of Guru Nanakdev will be celebrated all over the world .
And Guru Nanak Dev placed a royal royal shrine in front of them .
At present, when I took part in a group related to it, I had a sense of Lakpat Saheb Gurudwara.
If the earthquake occurred in Gujarat in 2001, then that Gurudwara had a great effect.
But even today, the state government has reproduced it with those synonyms.
The Government of India has made a significant decision.
That is to build the Kartarpur road , so that the travellers of our country can easily be helpful in the pilgrimage of Guru Nanak Dev , situated in Kartarpur of Bagistan .
My poor folks, after the 50th part of the chorus of the mind, we'll meet again in the next mind, the chance to make your feelings first time in the brass of the brass, is the reason why you raise yourself, but this journey will continue.
I'm gonna be enjoying all that we're gonna be deeper and deeper, so much I'm connecting with you.
Someone's minds questioning what I got from the cheek of the mind.
Put me back through the voice of the mind, in which one thing touches my heart that I want to tell you today.
Most of the family members have agreed to sit together and listen to the voice of the mind, sitting in between our family leader, we're talking about our things.
When I asked this kind of spreading, I think that your man, your accustomed, you're the one you're growing me, it's very nice.
In some way, I'm coming back through your family's clutches, and I'm supposed to be colored with you.
Take care of yourself, please.
Your neighbours, my neighbours.
Your wishes are applause, my wishes are applause.
Come on, let's move this trip further.
Thank you very much.
.
