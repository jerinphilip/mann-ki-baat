Talk about the mind, July 2015, my dear countrymen, greetings
This year the rain has started well.
Our farmer brothers, sisters will definitely help in sowing kharif.
And a happy thing has come to me and I am enjoyed.
There is a lot of dearth of pulses and oilseeds in our country - pulses and oilseeds.
Grib needs pulses, eating a little bit of oil in vegetables and so on.
It is a matter of great pleasure for me that the grown this time has increased almost 50 percent in pulses.
And oilseeds have increased slightly 33 percent.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters so I congratulate them very much.
My dear countrymen, on July 26, is marked as Kargil Vijay Divas in the history of our country.
The country's farmer's relationship, as much as the land is, is also the young man of the country.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers, one hundred and fifty enemies were heavier.
Regardless of my life, I bow down to those brave soldiers who foil the enemy's efforts.
Kargil war was not fought on borders only, every city in India, every village, contributed to this war.
These wars, fight for those mothers, sisters whose young son or brother was fighting enemies in Kargil.
Those daughters fought, with whose hands, Mehndi of Peher did not land.
The father fought, who saw his young sons, felt young.
And the son fought, who had not even learned to walk by holding his father's finger.
Today, due to their sacrifice, India can talk about raising the head in the world.
And so, today on Kargil Vijay Day, all these fighters are my 100 salutations.
From another point of view on July 26, because, after the formation of our government in 2014, we started MyGov on July 26 in a few months.
Our resolve to increase public participation in democracy, adding people to the work of development, and today I am happy to say this after a year, nearly two crore people saw MyGov.
About five and a half million people made comments, and the most happy thing is that more than fifty thousand people suggested on PM applications, they took time, Mind applyed, considered this work important.
And how important suggestions came
Akhilesh Vajpayee had sent a good suggestion from Kanpur that the disabled persons were inside the railway.
Why should not a quota ticket be given through RTI website
If the disabled also have to face the same difficulties to get the ticket, how appropriate is it
Now the matter is small, but no one has ever noticed this in the government, nor has it been thought.
But on the suggestion of Bhai Akhilesh Vajpayee, the government seriously considered, and today this system was implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
The people who become today, become tag-line, the program is composed, policy becomes, there are very positive suggestions on MyGov.
There is a new Resh Air experience in the governance system.
There is experience of a new consciousness.
These days, I have also started suggesting on MyGov, what should I speak on August 15
Suchitra Raghvachari from Chennai, she has sent a lot of suggestions.
Speak on daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, speak on clean Ganga, speak on clean India.
But this gave me an idea, what should I say this time on August 15
Can you send me suggestions
Can send to MyGov, write a letter on AIR.
The Prime Minister can write a letter in the office.
View
I believe, perhaps it is a good idea that my speech on August 15, suggestions from Janardhana.
I'm sure you'll send good suggestions.
On one point I want to express my concern.
I do not want to give any preaching nor am I looking for a way to avoid the responsibility of the units of the state government, central government or local Swaraj institutions.
Just two days ago, I looked at an accident scene in Delhi.
And after the accident, the scooter driver was suffering for 10 minutes.
He did not get any help.
Anyway, I have seen that many people constantly write to me that you speak something on the road safety.
Warn people.
Hoshakote Akshay of Bangalore, Amey Joshi of Pune, Prasanna Kakunje of Murbidari of Karnataka.
All of them, i.e. are of enough people, I am not telling everyone's name - have expressed concern over this subject and said.
Your concern is all right.
And when you look at the figures, the heart shakes.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
Due to the accident, due to the Roadacident, there is a death every 4 minutes.
And this is also the topic of the biggest concern, about one-third of those who die, young people of 15 to 25 years of age and one death shakes the whole family.
Whatever government wants to do, it should be done, but I pass through my parents, whether your children run two-wheeler or four-wheeler - Whatever is the matter of safety The atmosphere should be increased in the family too.
Sometimes we look at auto-rickshaws, it says, "Papa comes home early, reads how much touching, and so I say, "It's true that the government has done a lot of new initiatives in this direction. Whether it is a matter of education, enginering the construction of the road, the matter of ordering the law - or after the accident, the injured people are talking about emergency care, keeping all these things in mind, we are going to bring "Road Transport and Saetty Bil."
In the coming days, we are also thinking of taking many important steps towards implementation of National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
Another project is for us, it is going to be expanded further, ashless Treatment. Gudgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara. From there to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon, Moondia highways, we have a Ashless Treatment. And that means that there are first fifty hours - no money, no one will give money, who will not give up, leave all these concerns - once who is injured in the road accident, how will he get the best service, how Sarwar gets priority
To give information about accidents across the country, toll-free number 1033, ambulance, all these things. But all these things are after the accident.
We all really love each life, one life is very dear, it needs to be seen in that form.
Sometimes I say, be employee karmayogi.
In the past few incidents came to me in my mind, I like to talk to you, sometimes the person gets tired of doing a job, and for a few years it is good, salary gets, work, That's the feeling.
But in the past, I got a information about the railway staff, Vijay Biswal in Nagpur division is a TT, now he is fond of painting, now he could panting anywhere, but he considered the railway as his admirer and he works in the railway and keeps painting the different scenes related to the railway, he also gets a joy and inside that work so much interest increases.
Seeing this big example, I liked how life can be brought in my work too.
Vijay Biswal has told how his interest, his art, his ability can be added to his work.
Maybe now Vijay Biswal's painting will be discussed in the coming days.
And also one thing came in my mind - The whole team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, the whole group started a work that touched my mind and I like it very much.
He started "Operation Mal war" - Now this one, listening to it, it will be something else.
But the basic thing is that they have given a new turn to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and they have launched a campaign in the entire district, Brother Numbernne, that is, the best brother who will offer a tilet to his sister on Raksha Bandhan, and has taken the initiative to inspire all such brothers and inspire their sisters Toilet and in the whole district, they have to not be defecated, they are doing this work on the festival of Rakshabandhan.
See how Rakshabandhan changed, I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.
Now a news came on my ears, sometimes these small things enjoy my mind very much.
So I'm sharing you.
Keshla is a small village in Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh.
The people of that village tried to make the toilet for the last few months.
And now no person has to go to the open in that village.
They did this, but when the whole work was completed, the whole village celebrated such a very big festival as celebrated.
The village achieved this achievement.
Keshla village celebrated a very big festival together.
These best examples are coming to me about how the values are changing in society, how the people are changing and how the citizen of the country is taking the country forward.
I am writing from Bhavesh Deka, Guwahati, regarding North-East questions.
The people of North-East are also very much.
They write a lot, it's a good thing.
But I'm glad to tell them today that there is a separate ministry for North-East.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, an ENDR Ministry had become Development of North-East Region. After our government was formed, our NCR Department has made a big decision that North-East will be able to sit in Delhi.
And all decided to meet that the team of officials of the Government of India will go to those states of North-East. Nagaland Ho, Manipur Ho, Arunachal Ho, Tripura Ho, Assam Ho, Sikkim and will camp there for seven days.
Will go to the districts, go to the villages, meet the local government officials there, talk to the people's representatives, talk to the citizens.
Listen to the problems, the Government of India will also do whatever to solve the problems.
These efforts will bring very good results in the coming days.
And those officials who come to tax, they also feel how beautiful the state, how good people, now have to be developed by developing this area, their problems have to be resolved.
Return with this resolution, even after coming to Delhi, it has become very simple to understand the problems there.
So a good effort, trying to go far from Delhi to east, which I am saying "Act Last Police", this is the fact.
My dear countrymen, we all proud of the fact that we enjoy the success of Mars Mission.
In the past, India's UPSC-28 has launched five satellite launches of K.
India has launched this most eavywight satellite launch so far.
These news happens that comes for some moments, goes, we do not pay attention to it.
But this is a very big achievement.
But sometimes this idea comes, today if we talk to the younger generation and ask them what you want to be ahead, then one or half of the 100 will be difficult to get a studient which will say that I have to become a scientist.
It is a matter of great concern to reduce the trend towards Science.
Science and Technology is a kind of DNA of development.
Our new generation dreams of becoming scientist, Research, I
Take interest in annovation, get encouragement, know their abilities, a great need.
Right now, the Ministry of Human Resource Development of India has started a national invention campaign.
Former President of our nation Dr. Kalam ji has started this.
ID under this campaign
I
T, NI
T, Central and State Environments as a center, where there are such possibilities, encourage those children, guide them, help them, focus on them.
I'm the government's UID
I keep telling the ASC officers that if you have gone ahead by writing so much, then you should also go to a school college near yourself for two to four hours a week.
Whatever experience you have, your strength will definitely work for this new generation.
We have taken a huge initiative, should our villages of our country get electricity for 24 hours or should not get electricity
The work is difficult, but to do it.
We have started it.
And in the coming years, we get 24 hours electricity to the villages.
Even the children of the village, if you have to study in the days of examination, then there is no problem of electricity.
If there are small industries in the village, then electricity is available.
Today even if mobile charts have to be done then another village has to go.
The villages should get the benefits that the cities get.
You should go to the poor house.
And this is why we have started "Dindayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Program".
I know so big country, millions of villages, to reach far and wide, to reach home.
But, it's only for poor people to run.
We'll do it, start it.
I'm gonna do it.
Today, in the matter of mind, it was decided to talk about frequency.
In a way our country has the opportunity of the month of August, September, the festivals.
A lot of festivals live.
My best wishes to all of you
Send me suggestions for August 15.
Your thoughts will be very useful to me.
Thank you very much.
