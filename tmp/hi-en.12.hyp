Talking to the mind, February 2018, my dear countrymen, greetings
Today in the beginning only the talk of the mind starts with a phone call .
( FON ) Honorable Prime Minister , I am speaking from Komal Tripathi Meerut . On 28th is National Science Day . I
The progress of India and its growth is fully connected to the science. As soon as we research and innovation in it, we will move forward and prosper. Can you say some words to motivate our youth so that they can advance their thinking and move our country forward. Dhanyad. Thank you very much for your phone-call
My young colleagues have asked me questions about science, keep writing something or something
We have seen that the colour of the sea is blue , but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no colour of water .
Have we ever thought that there is a river, a sea, why the water becomes colorful
This was the question of a young man in the 1920s .
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India .
When we talk of science then the name of Indo-Ratna Sir C . . Raman comes first in front of us .
He was awarded the Nobel Portuguese for excellent work on light scattering .
One of his treasures is known as Raman Defect .
We celebrate 28 February every year because it is said that on this day they had expressed the incident of flight scattering .
For which he was given the Nobel Prize .
This country has given rise to many great scientists in science .
On one hand, there has been tradition of great mathematician Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhat, on the other hand, Sushruta and Charak are our pride in the field of medicine.
Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and from Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are the prides of India .
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose , Lamous Particle Boson was also named .
Recently I got the opportunity to join a program in Mumbai - Wadhwani I
nstitute for Artificial I
Inauguration of Entelligence
It was interesting to know about the miracles that are happening in the field of science
Artificial ID
Robots, bots and specific task machines are helped through internet
Nowadays machines make their own intelligence more smart by cell learning
This technology can be used to improve the lives of poor, deprived or needy
Artificial ID
In that program of Entelligence, I urged the scientific community to facilitate the life of Divya brothers and sisters, how the Artificial II
Can you get help from entelligence
What are we Artificial I
Can you guess better about natural disasters through Entelligence
Can farmers help with fruit yield
Whether the Artificial ID
Can entelligence be helpful in simplifying access to health services and treating diseases in modern ways
I am in Gujarat, I am in Ahmedabad with Israel's Prime Minister in the past.
There was an opportunity to go to the inauguration of the Reate
There, a young man told a digital instrument develop that if no one can speak through that instrument, he converts into the voice and you can communicate the same way as you do with a speaker
I think the Artificial I
We can use Entelligence in many such modes
Science and Technology, value are neutral
They don't have values, themselves
Any machine will do the same thing as we want
But, it depends on us what we want to do with the machine
Human - purpose becomes important here .
Use of science for human and female welfare, experiment to touch the highest heights of human life
The inventor Thomas Alvadison failed many times in his experiments
Once asked about this, he replied, "I have discovered ten thousand ways of not making ight Bulb, i.e. Dison also made his failures his power."
Incidentally , today I am in the Auroville ' s workplace of Maharishi Aurobindo .
As a revolutionary, he challenged British rule, fought against him, questioned his rule
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life
Answer discovered and guided humanity .
To know the truth, the feeling of asking questions repeatedly is important
This is the real inspiration behind scientific treasure .
You should not sit in peace until you get answers to questions like why and how
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate all the people associated with our scientists, science
Our young-women are motivated to search for truth and knowledge, with the help of science, be motivated to serve society, I have a lot of good wishes for this
At the time of Crisis, Safety, Disaster, I have a lot of messages on all these subjects, people write me somewhat
Mr . Ravindra Singh from Pune has spoken to the Occupational Safety in his comment on the Narendramodi mobile app .
He has written that there are softest standards on actories and construction sites in our country
India's National Safety Day on March 4, then Prime Minister should talk about Safety in his "Mann" program so that awareness about Safety increases among the people
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important pro-activeness and the other is preparedness
Safety is two types of one who needs the time of disaster, safety during disasters and the other who needs daily life, Safety in everyoneday life
If we are not aware of Safety in daily life, then it becomes difficult to get it during the disaster
We read bords written on the paths many times
It says, "There is a deterioration decreased, "One loss, sneaking happiness and smile, "Do not leave the world so quickly, add ties with security now - "Do not do any fun, or sex will be cheaper than that of those sentences are never used in our life"
If you leave natural disasters then most of the accidents are the result of some of our mistakes .
If we are cautious, follow the necessary rules, then we can protect our lives, but, we can save society from too big accidents
Sometimes we have seen that many sources have been written about safety on work place but when you see it then it does not look at anywhere .
I urge the municipalities, municipalities who have fire brigade should go to different schools once a week or month and make a mock in front of school children .
He will have two advantages - Fire Brigade also has the habit of being cautious and the new generation gets its education , and there is no different cost for it - in a way education becomes a sequence and I always urges this .
As far as disasters are concerned, it is a matter of disastrous, India is a country full of diversity in terms of geographical and climate.
This country has suffered many natural and man-made disasters such as chemical and industrial accidents .
Today National Disaster Management Authority i.e. NDA is leading disaster management in the country .
Earthquake, floods, cyclones, landslides such as various disasters, rescue operations, NMA arrives immediately
They have also released guidelins, along with they continue to work continuously for capacity buildings.
Initiatives have also been taken to train volunteers in floods, cyclones in danger
Training and awareness have a very important role
Two - three years ago thousands of people lost their lives every year from Lou Cheat Wave .
After this, NMA organized workshop for the management of the wheat wave, campaigned to create awareness among the people
The weather department has accurate forecast .
A good result came from all the partnerships .
In 2017, the number of deaths due to Lu decreased unexpectedly to nearly 220
This shows that if we prefer security, we can get security
There are countless people working in this way in society, social organizations, are aware citizens - I want to appreciate all those who get disaster anywhere in relief and rescue work within minutes
And the number of such anonymous heroes is no less
Our Fire and Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Armed Forces, Paramilitary Forces, these Veer Bahadur, who reached the time of crisis, help people without caring for their lives
Organizations such as N, Scouts are also doing these work nowadays, are also training
In the past , we have initiated an effort to ensure that in the countries of the world there is joint military efficiency , why not join the country of the world for Disaster Management
India has left it BIL
MST, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal, a joint disaster management of these countries was also done, it was itself the first and big human experiment
We have to become a risk conscious society
In our culture we often talk about values, safety of values, but we have to understand values of safety
We have to make it a part of our life
In our normal life we have seen that we travel in the airplane hundreds of times and provide information about air hostess in the early air plane
We must have heard it hundreds of times , but today we should take us into an airplane and ask which thing we have said .
Where's Lie Jacket
How to use
I claim none of us will be able to tell
I mean , what was the arrangement of giving information
It was
Is there a possibility of seeing it directly
It was
But we didn ' t
Why
Because we are not conscious with nature and so listen to our ears, after the airplane sat, but "This information is for me, no one of us thinks "
We have the same experience in every field of life .
We don't think that Safety is for someone else, if we all get alert for our safety then the sense of society is also inherent
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, "West to wealth and Waste to Energy" was emphasized for biogas for villages under clean India"
The initiative was started for this and it was named GBAR-Han - Galvaniing rganic Bio-Agro Resources
The objective of this GBAR-Han scheme is to clean the villages and to make solid waste products of animal dung and fields to PMST and BI
C-GAS, convert money and energy generate from
Cattle population in India is the largest in the world .
The population of cattle in India is approximately 30 million and the production of dung is about 30 lakh tonnes per day .
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other biological wastes for the production of energy , but in India its full potential was not being used .
We are moving forward in this direction under the Clean India Mission Rural .
The goal of making cattle dung, waste from agriculture, garbage coming out of the kitchen, has been set to make all these biogas based energy
Under the "Gober Money Scheme", farmers, sisters and brothers will be encouraged in rural India to see dung and waste not just as Waste but as source of income"
Gober Money Scheme will provide many benefits to rural areas
It will help keep the village clean
Animals will be better and productivity will increase .
Self - sufficiency will increase in biogas for cooking and lightting .
Farmers and animal husbands will be helpful in increasing income
New jobs will be available for Caste culture, transportation, sale of biogas etc.
Online Trading platform will also be created for a smooth arrangement of the Gobar Money Scheme , which will connect the farmers from buyers so that the farmers can get the right price for dung and agricultural waste
I urge entrepreneurs , especially my sisters living in rural India to come forward
By creating cell help group, make cooperative societies take full advantage of this opportunity
I invite you to be partners of this movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs
Initiate the change in the wealth of Waste in your village and making dung from cow dung .
My dear countrymen, till date we have heard about music festival, food festival, film festival not know how many kinds of festivals
But in Raipur in Chhattisgarh , the first junk festival of the state was organised .
The objective behind this festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation was awareness about cleanliness .
Creatively use the city ' s Waste and create awareness about various methods of re-use of garbage .
During this festival there was a variety of activity in which everybody was involved from students to elders
Different types of artifacts were made using waste .
Workshops were organized to educate people at all aspects of Caste Management
Music performance took place on theme of cleanliness
Art work created
Inspired by Raipur different types of garbage festivals were also held in other districts .
Everyone took initiative from their side and innovative ideas, share, discussions, poems were read
A festival atmosphere was ready for cleanliness .
Especially the way schoolchildren took part in, it was amazing
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and administration there for the innovative manner in which the importance of Caste Management and Sanitation was displayed
International Women Day is celebrated on 8th March every year .
There are many programmes in the country and the world
On this day ' Nari Shakti Award ' in the country is also encouraged by such women who have done exemplary work in different areas in the past .
Today the country is moving towards women-lead development ahead of women's development
Today we are talking about development under the leadership of women ahead of women ' s development .
On this occasion , I remember Swami Vivekananda ' s promise .
He had said that the Videa of Perect Womenhood is perfect independence - twenty - seven years ago this idea of Swami expresses the contemplation of women power in Indian culture .
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social, economic life, it is our responsibility
We're part of the tradition, where men were identified by women
Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-putra, this was the identity of a son
Today our women ' s power has introduced self - confidence and self - confidence with their actions .
He has made himself self - reliant
They have already advanced themselves, and have worked to pursue the country and society and take them to a new level.
Next Our New ID
The dream of India is that where women are strong, they are equal partners in the overall development of the country
In the past , a great man had given me a very good suggestion .
He suggested that on March 8, there are programs like celebrating Women's Day.
Have you completed 100 years in every village .
Can such a program of respect for mothers and sisters be organized
And can there be talk of a long life
I feel good, I'm reaching you
What women power can do, you'll find a lot of examples
If you look around then some such stories will inspire your life .
Right now I got a news from Jharkhand
About 15 lakh women in Jharkhand under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan - this figure is not small .
15 lakh women organized a month ' s cleanliness campaign .
Under this campaign started on January 26, 2018, these women have set up a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
It includes about 1 lakh Sakhi Mandals .
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water-wheelers, 10 thousand women cleansing and 50 thousand women's Raj Mistry
You can imagine how big the event is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women's power is such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will continue to change the rituals of cleanliness effectively in the nature of public.
Bhaiyo-Bahno, just two days ago, I was seeing in News that electricity has reached 70 years after independence in three villages of Elephanta Island and how joy and enthusiasm is there among the people there .
You all know well, Elephanta island, ten kilometers away in the sea from Mumbai
This is a very big and attractive center of tourism .
Elephanta caves, DNSC's orld eritage are
There everyday tourists come in large quantities from country and abroad .
is an important tourist destination
I was surprised to know that despite being near Mumbai and being such a big center of tourism, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years of independence
For 70 years, the dark shadow that was in the lives of three villages Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sentbandar of Elephanta Island, is now dark and their life has been illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there
I am glad that now Elephanta ' s villages and Elephanta caves will be lightened by electricity
This is not just electricity, but a new beginning of development
The life of the countrymen is illuminated, what can be the moment of satisfaction and happiness increase by the happiness of their lives
My dear brother-in-law, right now we celebrate the festival of Shivratri
Now the month of March, the fields decorated with flamboyant crops, golden earrings of the wheat and the adornment of mango pouring the mind - This is the specialty of this month
But this month is also very favourable for Holi festival .
On 2 March the whole country will celebrate Holi festival with joy .
The importance of the colors in Holi is as important as Holika combustion as it is the day of burning evils into fire .
Holi is an auspicious opportunity to be part of each other's happiness and joy by forgetting all the minds and emotions and love gives a message of unity and brotherhood .
Best wishes to all the countrymen of Holi's color festival, best wishes colorful
This festival was filled with colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen .
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
.
