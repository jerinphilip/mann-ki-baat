Man Ki Boat, September 2018 My favorite patriot namaskar
Nobody is the Indian to absorb our troops, our military forces.
Any species, no place, no religion, or any language, every Indian is always ready to open our soldiers, all your happiness, support.
All the Indians celebrated the Parakara festival of 125 crores.
Remember the surgical strike in 2016.
When the war on our country in Terrizon's rascal, our soldiers gave our soldiers the answer to their ignorant behavior as a surgical stray.
In the subtle areas of the country, we have organized demonstrations.
The main purpose of this exhibition is to introduce most of our countrymen, our youth, the power of our country.
Let's find out how many of our capabilities are surpassing our lives and protecting all the nations, man.
The main days like Parakram Parve remind of the traditions of being known in our country as respectful to our soldiers in our youth .
With that our nation's equality, such festivals will encourage us to keep the right of the right.
I also participated in a program in Jodhpur of Rajasthan on the land of the volunteers.
The congregation that can give our soldiers the answer to whoever is trying to destroy our country's peace and commodities is now sure everyone understands.
We're peaceful.
We're determined to increase peace in the country.
But it doesn't happen to be the princess of the country, or the patronage of the country.
India is consistently engraved, indicative of peace.
In the two world wars that took place in the twelfth century, our country's soldiers gave clean ballots for more than one lakh peace.
Even though we have nothing to do with those wars.
Our vision never lies on our planet.
It's our obligation to peace.
A few days ago, on the thirteenth day of September, the hypha war took place in Israel, in the full context of Mysore, Hyderabad, Jodhpur, remembered our heroic soldiers.
Our volunteers blew up with those who betrayed them and gave them the liberty of Haifa.
It's an adventure that our country's soldiers aimed at seducing peace.
India is also one of the largest number of soldiers in the variety of peace security forces of the State Committee.
For decades, our heroes are playing an important role in establishing peace in the world wearing blue helmets.
My favorite patriotism, the sky skies are strange.
Even the sky has fascinated our universe team, which attracts the attention of all the nation.
Relieved the belief that protects us.
During the Republic Day celebrations , for whatever part of the parade people are waiting , one of them is fly past .
It shows its strength with the amazing tasks of our imaginary team.
On the 8th of October we celebrate the Vaimana Dal Day celebrations.
In 1932 , the very small valuable team of kinships , 19 soldiers etc . increased .
Now our team stands one of the brave, powerful immigrants in the twenty-three century.
It's a wonderful journey.
These warriors who served their lives for the country, my heart full of respect for their families.
In 1947, when they started attacking Pakistan, they saved Srinagar from the invaders of India.
Indian soldiers, their means, have made a sure plan to reach right time during war.
In 1965, the enemy's face was ruined and it was our wise team.
Who didn't know about the Freedom of Bangladesh in 1971
In 1999, the strategic team played an important role in quitting Kargil out of the slaughterhouse.
Tiger Hills, at the centre of the enemy at night, slaughtered them and slaughtered them.
Being a support rehabilitation, the operation of disaster is so gratitude for the country because of the brilliant actions of our Air Force fighters.
From storms, winds, floods to the jungles in the jungle, facing all the opponents of nature, they are marvellous to help the people of the country.
The gender equality of the country, that is, the woman, has stood for an example in determining the equality of men.
A special women's department was organized for our country's maidens.
Now our strategic team also interferes with the Short Service Commission for women.
I made this announcement from the Red Fort stage on August 15.
Now India can be said to be a glory of women's power with the strength of men in the armed forces of the Indian Army.
The powerful woman is now also a warrior.
My favorite patriot, a few days ago, the officer of our boat team, Avalash Tommy, fought with death for his life.
Yawat's country has shocked how to protect him.
You know Kada Express Tommy is a very brave officer.
Without using any kind of modern technology, he's the first Indian to spread the world with just a small boat.
In the South Hindu Maha Sea, he's moving forward to pave in Golden Globe Race for the last eighty days, sustaining his speed in the sea.
But the storm of the terrible sea brought him trouble.
But this volunteer of the Indian Navy had spent many days fighting in the sea.
He was constantly fighting without swimming in the sea water, but he didn't abstain.
He's the greatest example of courage, vision, oppression.
I talked to him in the phone after I brought him out of the sea a few days ago.
I'm gonna meet him so early.
Even after coming out of such a disaster, he's daring, fighting, wants to take such courage again.
All these are also inspired by our country's youth.
I'm sorry to shine the health of Tommy.
His courage, his opponent, his vision, the fighting, the winner's vision of inspiration to our country's youth.
My favourite Desh Prajalara, the second day of October is the story of everyone who knows how important our country is.
This year, there's a special feature for October.
From now on to one second we all celebrate Mahatma Gandhi 's 150th Jayanti festival through many programs worldwide .
Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts gave inspiration to the world.
Dr.
The great leaders like Martin Luther King Cunior, Nelson Mandela, also have the strength of Mahatma Gandhi from the thoughts of fighting for equality and respect to the Taluku rights of their people.
In the Manki Bath program, I want to talk to you about another important work done by worshipping Baba.
It's important to know most of the people of the country about it.
In 1941 Gandhiji started writing some thoughts in the form of constructional programme i . e .
Later, in 1945, when he struggled for freedom, he made a promise of his thoughts.
Puja Baba put his thoughts in front of the country on many matters like farmers, villages, laboratories, cleaning, education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Puja Bap's public collector.
Bapu's specialty is to join people, to join them.
It's his nature.
It's the speciality of his personality that everyone recognized.
It's the most important, important compulsion for the country.
The main role he took during the freedom struggle is to convert that fight into a democracy.
On the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, every class of society, all the people belonging to every region have also depicted themselves for the freedom struggle.
Bap gave us a motivational magic.
It was known by the name of Gandhiji Tayat.
What Gandhiji would say in it, "I'll give you a drink to all of you.
Whenever you have any doubts, or take a look at your guy's authority.
Remember his face, whoever is very poor, weak in the people you saw.
How can you help that guy that step down
Think that .
Can that poor man help me decide
Can he benefit anymore
Can he make any changes in his life
Can some people hungry with hungry hungry by my decision
Can their soul be satisfied
Ask that.
Then you're gonna be relieved of doubt, you think you're crushing." Bappu said.
My favorite patriot, this mantra said Gandhiji is still important.
Today the middle class grows in the country, their economic strength grows, the power of buying increases.
A moment when we go to buy something, remembering the priest's father, remembering this mantra once he said.
I'm giving benefit to any citizen in the country by buying this thing
Who's gonna enjoy your face
Who's gonna get the benefit of my buying directly but indirectly
I'm very happy to buy my buying if it benefits the person who doesn't.
Previously before all your shopping, you must remember this mantra that Gandhiji said.
During Gandhi's 150th victory, it is remembered that somebody uses a fucking sneeze by our shortcomings, thinks that everybody who has invested in his money will benefit something.
This is Gandhiji's tale.
This is his message.
I believe the poorest, the weakest person's life can change greater than the feet you put.
Gandhiji said that if my favorite patriot, satisfaction will be free.
He didn't know how, but India was welcome.
Likewise, you may think that I will be able to give my country's economic growth, financial authority, poverty to the poor, because of this small job you do.
But this is the true patriot of today's age, this is the Karyanjali who gives us Gandhiji.
For example, on special occasions, many people who have helped the karmikas with the purchases of the producers.
Lal Bahadur Shastri, who was old, used to snatch dressed clothes too.
Whoever has trouble in it would have done it with the idea of Kada.
If all these empty dresses are so difficult, they don't want to become eager, they need to use each other.
The favour of the country, such great feelings of love for the people of the country are filled up in the Mahamani Shi Narnaral having very little steps.
In two days we will celebrate Shastri 's victory with the pride of worship .
As soon as the name of Shastri is heard , an infinite devotional faith in our Indian minds will rise .
Their beautiful personality fills every man with glory.
Looked very humble from outside, Lal Bahadur Shastri, who had a strong conviction like a mountain from within.
"Jai Jawan Joe Kissan" is a nice vision of the great personality of Shastri.
During the fifties of his succession, he gave the mission to the country soldiers and the peasants of the Vijay Shikhar.
It's a vision to love him with the country.
My favorite patriot, it's simple to talk about clarity when we remember the priest.
A festival started from September fifteenth to "Pure Service".
Cross people are involved in this furnace.
I also got the chance of cleaning the children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar himself put that school in prison.
All sections of the country participated in the day of September fifteenth.
Many organizations were very excited in this program.
School children, college children, n.
C.
C, n.
S.
S, young groups, media groups, corporate worldwide people also paid tributes for cleanliness at a big height.
That's why I'm showing heartful pleasure to all these clean lovers.
Let's call a phone call. "Namaskar
My name is Shaitan Singh.
I'm talking to Pugal Tehsil, Bikaner district, Rajasthan.
Nobody's blind.
My two eyes aren't visible.
I'm full of blind.
I want to say that the work of making a clean India made by Mon Ki Bath program is very important.
My blind people have to go out for school.
It was very difficult.
Now we were very useful when the construction of the school was done in the house.
It's a very important step.
Thanks for this work like this."
You said so good.
There is a special place for cleanliness in everybody's life.
It's very useful to you because of the construction of toilets in your house through the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Are we all enjoying so much
You are unable to see so but the beneficiaries of this festival are also not imagined to participate in it .
We don't know if you don't phone if you don't know how much it becomes after the toilet was built before the toilet was built.
This magnificent frequency doesn't come to the notice of the weekend surrounding the pursuit movement.
I'm telling you special thanks to your phone call.
My favorite patriot, "Swachchha Bharat Mission" has become a successful story not only in our country but also in the world.
Everyone wants to say about it.
India has been operating this time with the world's greatest cleverness that stands in history.
"Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention" means "Mahatma Gandhi International Cleanliness Day", experts from this world come together and share their experiences and experiences in this purity world.
With the start of Baba's 150th Jayanti festival on the second day of October 2018, this 'Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention' completes.
My favorite patriotism, there is a word in Sanskrit... "Naya-born self-religion".
I mean, there's only justice at the root of the kingdom.
When the matter is discussed, it's entirely within the sense of human authority.
In order to provide freedom, peace, justice to the obsessed, suffering, stubborn people, it's specially inevitable combination.
Several laws have been made for the premier rights in the courtesy created by Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Inspired by their view, 1993 October 12, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of the Communication of the National Human Rights.
NHRC's gonna be finished in a few days.
NHRC hasn't saved human rights.
This commission also worked to increase our respect.
Our former predecessor, our favourite leader, Mr. Atal Bihari Wazpai, clearly said, "The human rights are not ourselves."
In the symbol of the Commission of our National Human Rights, the ideal synthesis of the legendary period is engraved.
NHRC has given extensive knowledge for human rights.
Meeting with that, it also took a shining role to stop the misuse of those rights.
NHRC has made a hopeful, trustworthy environment in the country in this journey of slaves.
For a healthy society, I believe that this is a big lucky event for the best democratic values.
Now, with the work of human rights at the national level, the commission of human rights of twenty six countries has also been established.
As a society, we have to try to bring human rights, to the conversion.
This is the basis of the idea of "Sub Ka Sath, Sub Ka Vicas" with all his cooperation.
My favorite patriot, the month of October is Jaya Prakash Narayana's victory.
In this month the centenary Jayanti festivals of Rajmata Vijayraja Scindia begin .
All these great men were inspirational to us.
My joys to them.
Sardar Saheb Jayanti is on the 31st of October.
I'll explain in Man Ki Bath, who came about them, but that's all I'd sure do this proposal.
The 31 narrative Run Fur UNITI, which is from last corners, has been organised in every small town in India, in the villages, run for unity.
Even this time, we try to make this "Ron Fur UNT" in every small town, in the villages.
The best way to remember Sardar Saheb's program "Ronfur UNT".
Because he's been with India's equality throughout his life.
On October 31, we force all our efforts to wipe out every section of society, everywhere in the country with equality.
That's what we give him a good reverence.
My favorite patriot Prajalara, Navaratri, Durga Puja or Vijay Dashmi, is telling you many pursuits for this sacred festival.
Thank you.
