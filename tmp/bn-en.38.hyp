My favourite countrymen, greeting all of you, the Bengal Translation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Man Ki Vaat' (fifteenth festivals) program
It's my last "Man Ki Wat" program in 2015.
Agami will be the "Man Ki Wat" in the year 2016.
We've been christmaspalan a few days ago, and we're preparing to welcome the new year.
India is a specific country.
There are different kinds of festivals.
There's another one who doesn't go.
One way, one festival goes to invite the next festival.
Sometimes, India seems to be a country where the geography is connected with the festival.
Festival is the way for the poorest summit of society.
I'm enjoying Christmas all the natives and enjoying a lot of good news in English New Year, 2016.
I'm gonna get a lot of happiness for you all.
New joys, new hopes, new imaginations to reach you on a new height.
Whether it is a warmth, world warmth, natural distinction, human-precific other complications.
A man's life will be happy and calm, what's the matter of greater joy
You know I use technology in full, I know a lot about it.
I take special care of the mygov portal.
Mr. Ganesh Vi Saoleshwarkar from Pune has written to me that this time is the season of tourism.
Many tourists from the country and abroad come.
Many go out to spend Christmas holidays.
In the field of tourism, attention is given to all other facilities, but he has attracted a special attention.
Where tourists go and stay, we should be specially interested in keeping those tourist places clean.
As clean as our tourist centers are, India's image will be as bright as the World Day.
I welcome Mr. Sauleshwarkar's thoughts and let him reach the countrymen.
And that's why we're gonna be a guest.
When the guests come to our house, we decorate the house with very cleanness.
In the same way, keeping our tourist places, rest houses and guest houses clean, indeed, a big job.
I'm very happy to keep the country clean, I can see it regularly.
In this regard, I've been greeting my friends through publicity from the first day.
Because he's a little, but he's looking for good things and put it in front of the people.
Recently, I was reading in a newspaper, which I shall share with all the countrymen - there is a provincial worker named Dhilip Singh Malviya of Bhojpura village of Sihore district of Madhya Pradesh.
He's an ordinary princess.
He worked as an intelligent who was published in the newspaper.
So I think I'll get it to you.
Dhilip Singh Malviya, a resident of a small village, established that if someone of the village joins the necessary equipment for preparing toilets, then he will make a toilet without a maritime.
This work is sacred, so far he has worked in Bhojpura village and has constructed 100 toilets.
I'm congratulations and greetings to Dileep Singh Malviya.
Our country is sometimes desperate.
But there are millions of Dhilip sings, who have worked well in their own way.
This is the power of the country, this is the hope of the country.
These tasks lead the country to the development, and to honor Dhilip Singh at the 'Man Ki Wat' program and to feel our pride for it is very normal.
As a result of all human efforts, our country is moving fast.
125 million patriots have engaged and moved forward to the country.
A new opportunity for educated education, new technology and biography, to provide banking opportunities from bringing citizens under the precaution, to develop a new culture and new business in the international level, we have done all this.
Common family people couldn't reach the bank's door, they'd have accessed loans easily through the monetary plan.
When every Indian found out that all over the world has attracted yoga exercises and when all the countries of the world are united through International Yoga Day celebrations, our faith was born that this is our country and great India.
When we feel like this, it's a surprising picture in front of our eyes.
Like Mother Yashoda and Sri Krishna can forget about the Kahini - when Lord Shri Krishna visited the world Brahmin in his mouthpiece, Mother Yashoda had achieved the divine power of Balk Krishna.
The event of 'International Yoga Day' has revived us in that experience.
The purity of cleanliness is listening to every house.
The participation of the people has also increased.
Even after so many years of independence, when any village reaches the electric discovery, you cannot experience the unreasonable joy of darkness and facilitated city power.
The power offices of India and various kingdoms used to work before, but now in 1000 days we have imagined power reaching every village.
Every day, when we know that electricity is reaching in different villages of the country, then we can also know about the joy and enthusiasm of the people of that village.
Till now, it's not a wide range of publicity.
But my belief, the propaganda will reach this village and take the people's hopes and aspirations to the whole country.
That's why the biggest benefit will be that all government workers join this project, they will be enjoyed and enjoyed that they did something that would bring a big change in the life of the village.
This happiness is not necessary to reach farmers, poverty, youth, women.
Any government has worked, no government has worked - it doesn't need to reach the news, what they can get, they can't be saved.
They must be informed about their rights.
We must be conscious of the right and good messages of ordinary people to reach a large number of people.
This is also a kind of serving.
I did a little effort to do this to me.
I can't do everything alone, but I should do what I say.
A common man can communicate with me by downloading the 'Norendra Modi app' on his mobile phone.
I've shared a lot of small things through this app.
I'm enjoying it, through this app, many people are telling me a lot.
You're supposed to be like you.
I want to reach 125 million patriots, it's not possible without your help.
Come on, we all enjoy the common man's fun and right to reach the common language.
My dear young men, from the last 15th August Red Fort, I start up.
ndia, Stand up I
I had an initial talk about 'Ndia'.
Since then, in every government office, it has spread that India could become Start up capital.
Can't our kingdoms open new messages for the country's youth through new renovations for their new start up, production and agriculture or services
New thoughts about everything, new tricks.
Because the world can't move without new renovation.
Start up I
ndia, Stand up I
Nedia brought a big chance for young friends.
My young men, the Government of India Start up on January 16th.
ndia, Stand up I
The ndia is going to start the vision.
What will happen in this project, how and how it will be, the detailed circuit will be taken in front of you.
And in this project, all the II-T, I-I-M, Central University and N-I-T will be connected to the youth community through 'Live Connectivity'.
We have a binding idea about the Start up project that this project is for the Digital World or I-T workers, but it's not.
We want it to be renewed according to India's needs.
When the poor square works, he works.
If a young man recognizes some technologies, through which their hard work is slightly impossible, we consider it as Start up.
I'm gonna request the bank service to help the youngsters in this reception and tell the younger power. Go ahead, get the market.
It's wrong for our city's young friends that have only talent.
In every corner of India, there are talented young men, they need only chance.
This start up I
ndia, Stand up I
We need to spread all over India without limiting the Guticake city of India.
All state governments request us to take this project forward.
On January 16, I will meet you and discuss the public, I will be waiting for your advice.
Dear young men, the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda on 12th January.
Like me, there are millions of people in this country who are enlightened by Swami Vivekananda's ideal.
Since 1995, 12th January, Swami Vivekananda's birthday was celebrated as a national youth festival.
This year, this festival has been held from 12th January to 16th January in Raipur of Chhattisgarh.
Every year there is a theme of this festival.
I know, this year is the theme.
The Divine Youth of Development, Skill and Harmony i.e. the symbol of development, attraction and goodwill - Indian youth.
I know that more than 10,000 young men from every corner of India have been participating in this event.
A picture of India's small composition will be seen here.
A talent of young India will emerge here.
In a way, this festival will be a dream of dreams and will be a vision.
Can you give me some advice about this young man
My special request to the youngsters is to direct your advice through the Narendra Modi app.
I want to know and understand your mind.
It will be reflected in the national youth festival.
I'll give the right advice and information to my government.
Friends, I was waiting for your opinion about Young Festival through the Narendra Modi App.
Ahmdabad, the visually impaired teacher of Gujarat, Dilip Chauhan, in his school, "Accessible I"
ONDIA day celebrated.
He called me and told me his opinion.
He told me: Mr. Mahashya, we're accessible in our school.
I've been campaigning.
I'm a blind teacher.
I've spoken to about two thousand students about the awareness and how they can help in a person with special power.
I've got a lot of enthusiasm from the students.
To help the physically challenged persons in society, they have been inspired.
I think this effort is an important step.
Dhilipaji, thank you a lot.
You're working on it yourself.
You're well aware of their problems and you must have faced a lot of problems yourself.
When there is a chance to meet such people in society, I feel a lot of thoughts.
According to our thoughts, we express our vision towards their problems.
Some people are victims of anguish.
Some people are born to physically impaired.
A lot of words are used to identify all these people.
There's a lot of concern about this kind of word.
But all the time it seems, the use of such words for these people is not right, not honorable.
And you know how many words are used.
Sometimes Handicapped, so I ever heard a disabled word.
Specially Abled Person. I've heard a lot of such words.
It's okay that the word has a special significance.
This year the Government of India has started 'Sugum Bharat Abhiyan'.
I was supposed to be present in that event.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in Chennai, I had to go there due to terrible floods.
So I couldn't be present at the 'Good India Expedition' program.
Since I was supposed to be present in that event, I was supposed to think about it.
At this time, I remember, God who has given some imperfection or two organs don't work properly, we call him a complicated, disabled.
But sometimes when I meet them, I know that we have some incompleteness to that man, but God has given him some extra-power.
God has given them a special power, which we don't see.
When I saw him working, we looked at his ability, and wondered how he was doing it.
Then I think he might be faulty in our eyes, but he's got some extra-power, more power.
Seeing all this, I have a feeling that why don't we use the Dibang word instead of the evil words in our country
There are people who have one or many types of organs, who have divine power, which are not in the body of common people like us.
I love this word.
My request to the countrymen, can we prevail the word 'Dibang' instead of the evil word
I hope we can think about this in future.
That day we started 'Excipline India' campaign.
Physical and virtual - I will try to facilitate the people of Divang by developing these two types of structures.
Maybe we need many things like school, hospital, government office or bus terminus, railroad or ramp, easy parking and lifting, braille lip etc.
And to facilitate all these things, we need reflective energy, new technology and sensitive mind.
We started doing this, ordinary people are participating in it, they're doing this job.
You can also participate in it like you.
My dear countrymen, the government projects continue to come continuously, but it is especially necessary that the projects are effective and the neighbouring people are alive and alive.
Actually, the project is made for ordinary people, for poor people.
Nearly, the Government of India has started a project to reach the well-being person of various projects.
In our country, the gas cylinders are furious.
It costs a few crores, but the eligible person has access to this profit as long as there was no accounting.
The government has brought some changes about this.
With the help of 'Jan Dhan' accounts, base cards, etc., the world's most integral "Largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme" is directly accessible to the person's bank account.
I am proud to tell the countrymen that it's place in the Ginness Book of World Records to launch the biggest Direct Benefit Project with success.
This project, known as 'Pahal', has succeeded very much.
By the end of November, about 15 million El-PG-professionals have benefited through the plan.
15 million people arrive at government money directly at the bank account.
They don't need any help or supervision, or there's no possibility of tricks.
First, the impact of the base card, secondly, opening the 'Jan-Dhan' account in the bank, thirdly, making a list of benefits in the central government and the collective sector of state governments, the process of connectivity with the basis card and bank accounts of the person.
Nowadays, through the MNREGA project, the rural people's employment is ensured.
There was a lot of complaints about the funds offered by this project.
Now, in most places, this money is reaching the bank account of the workers directly.
There was a lot of trouble with the students' scalerships, and there was a lot of complaints.
This arrangement has been started for them too and it will be moved slowly.
The benefits in various projects have reached nearly 40 thousand crores directly at the bank account.
According to a general account, about 35 to 40 projects have been included in the 'Direct Benefit Transfer'.
My dear countrymen, January 26, general democracy day.
Give me a golden jewellery in the Indian Republic.
Good news, this year, the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Amvedakar.
Two days were specified in the Parliamentary Convention to discuss the constitution.
It's a good experience.
Each team has made a very good discussion about the rightful understanding of the sacredness, importance and constitution of the Constitution.
In the future, there must be such an effort.
In the right sense can the general system day connect every citizen with the constitution and the constitution with each citizen
Our constitution ensures us a lot of rights.
There's a lot of discussion about this right that's right.
This conversation is also very important.
The Constitution has also been equally emphasised on duty.
But there's no special discussion about this.
Especially during the election, our holy duty, written hoarding, advertisement, wall-writing etc. can be seen.
It's a matter of duty while voting, but why wouldn't it be duties in a lifetime
This year, when we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Amvedikar, on 26th January, I cannot organise the composition of our first duty in schools, colleges, villages, cities and various social organizations.
If 125 million Indians move forward to duty, then there will be a historical event.
First of all, we need to start discussing this.
I have a new idea.
Before 26th January, you can send me in writing poems, writing about your maternal or in English or Hindi.
I want to be aware of your thoughts.
I can send it to my migov portal.
I'm very interested in learning about the duty of our country's youth.
I want to keep a little offer.
On 26th January, when we celebrate the Commonwealth Day, I can take arrangements to clean and adorn the replicas of the great men established in our cities by the citizens and school-class students of the country and maintain the cleverness of the replica of nature. Can't I
I'm not talking about government arrangements.
As an ordinary citizen, we are as desperate as we are enthusiastic and emotional about the replica of these great men.
For society, can't we transform it into our normal habits for our country
On 26 January, come, we're all aware of the cleanliness of all these replicas built in honor of the great men.
For this, the ordinary people, citizens have to come forward in voluntarily.
My dear patriots, I'm giving you a lot of pleasure on the New Year, 2016.
Thank you all intuitive
.
