Man Ki Bath 2018 My dear patriots, greet you.
This is the first Man Ki Bath of 2018.
Two days ago, we celebrated Rippy's day with great enthusiasm.
For the first time in history, the rulers of 10 countries participate in this festival.
My dear patriots, Mr. Prakash wrote a long letter through the Triskini Narendramodi Aap.
He's very fond of talking about the subjects of that story.
As per it, yeah.
He reminded of Kalpana Chaula, who carried out a space journey, on February 1.
They've been inspired by millions of young people around the world, even if the complications have gone to us in danger of the colombia space ship.
Mr.
Prakashji started his long letter indicating the release of the Kalpana.
We're sorry for the loss of Calpana Chowla at such a young age.
They went to the world of their own life, especially to thousands of Pecus in India.
If there's a desire and a vision, it's not impossible to do anything.
It's very pleased to see these women grow fast in all parts of India and glorify the country.
In ancient times, women of our country were honored, their place in society, their contributions made the whole world surprised.
There's a long tradition of Indian scholars.
There are contributions of a lot of scholars in the formation of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitrey...
I'll tell you about Bachao, Bai Pathao.
In the ancient times, Rachikape says in Skandapurana: Dashaputra, Sammanya, Dashaputraan, which is the result, Martiya, Tattavya, is a maiden.
I mean, a daughter is equal to ten sons, and ten sons will be rewarded in a daughter.
It shows the importance of women in our society.
That's why our society has given women the status of power.
This lady's power is to finish the whole country, the whole community, to the unit of the family.
Although the scholars of the Vedic period Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitrei are the scholars of Akamahadevi and Meerabai are devoted, but the ruler of Ahlyabai Holkar has the courage of Rani Lakshmibai, but women's strength is inspired to us.
Increase the magnitudes of the country.
Mr.
There's a lot of examples on the light trident.
He wrote our country's secretary, Mr. Nimala, Sitaraman, a warfare, inspired Sukhoi in 30.
Under the leadership of Vartika Joshi, the women members of the Indian Navy have written about the world around INSV Tarani.
The brave women, Bhavna Kanth, Mohena Singh, who were the pilots of the Eiver War and trained in Sukhoi 30.
The women under the leadership of Katipa Vajpei proudly fly to San Francisco in Delhi and Delhi in the Boeing Jet of Air India.
All women must remember...
.
That's okay.
These women don't shut up everywhere, but take responsibility.
There are many fields to do great work in our women's power.
They set up the Kirtistambh.
Last day our president has started a new beginning.
For the first time in their respective fields, the President saw an extraordinary group of women who performed great acts.
These women handled by the name - First woman , Merchant Navy captain , first lady train driver of Travel train , first woman fire fighter , first female bus driver , first woman in Antarctic , first woman in Everest , for the first time in all the areas - women who have been able to handle our women 's strength .
They've waited for a new way to put all the obstacles and responsibilities on the strength of Eiva.
Not only their contemporary people, but also a way of inspiration for generations.
They'll fill up a new excitement and inspiration.
Prepare a book about these women who have taken care of them, and not the country should know about this womanpower, and you must be inspired by what they did in their lives.
It's available for E-bu in the Narendra Modi Web site.
Women's power has a very important role in effective changes in this country and society.
I want to tell you about a railway station when we talk about women's education.
The railway station and the women's education... you'll think about what's the connection between them.
The Ma 'Unga Station in Mumbai is the first station in India of all the workers of women.
In all the departments, women workers - even in the Commercial category, the Railway Police is concerned, but the ticket checking, the point-person, but the women there are more than 40 working women.
Many of these people, after seeing the Ripe's Day parade, were written in the media and other social programs about BSAF's biker content.
They showed adventures.
This scene surprised the guests abroad.
Sacrifice is a form of self-confidence.
This is giving our women's strength.
You're getting yourself enough.
There's another thing like this in my mind.
Tribal women of Chhattisgarh also worked miracles.
They're a new example, Mue.
When you talk about tribal women, there will be a picture in everyone's mind.
There will be jungles, there will be be beds.
There will be women walking in the head with the weight of the elbow.
Our tribal women of El Chhattisgarh - this womanpower is a new picture in our country.
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh is a region of Mavodatta.
Himsa, invasions, bombs, guns, pistols. It's a terrible atmosphere full of maoists.
In such a terrible region, tribal women run e-Orissa and achieve self-determination.
For a very short time, many women stay in touch with this.
It's the musks.
On one side, the job makes them strong, on the other, the picture of the affected area of magic.
With all this, it has the power to protect the environment.
Appreciate the district wealth of this district, till the grant of the grant, the district administration has played an important role in the success of these women.
We're often listening, there's nothing in our habits...
What's that.
That's how it changes and changes.
Leave all the time, accept the changes needed.
It's the vitality of our society... the continuous effort of self-determination, self dresser... this Indian habit is our tradition.
The symptoms of any living society are the ability to transform itself.
For centuries against social misconceptions and misdeeds, our society does not continue to work on personally and socially.
A few days ago, there was a beginning in Bihar.
In order to seize social misconceptions in the state, the world's largest man-children ended at a length of fifteen thousand kilometers.
Through this gathering, awakens the community's witness against misconducts like child marriage, women's tradition.
The state has concentrated together to fight evils like women's money and child marriage.
Boys and grown-ups and enthusiasm, young men, mothers, sisters, all joined themselves in this battle.
The territory of the man-childing state, which started on the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, is not much terrible.
Everyone in the society needs to be free from misconception to get the development of the society properly.
Come, let's try to salvage the society together, create a new India, a powerful and capable India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar and the Chief Minister of the state to participate in the administration and mankind for such a specific and extensive beginning for the community.
My dear patriots, Mr. Mysore in Karnataka.
The darshan wrote in "My Geovi", he spent six thousand rupees a month for his father's treatment.
He didn't know about the Prime Minister's Jan medicine plan.
When you know about the gene medicine plan, you started buying trees, the cost of dying decreased by 75.
He wanted me to tell you about this at the Manki Bath program.
A lot of people know about it, yes, and they're gonna have it.
In the last few days, many people didn't write me about it, I didn't say.
I and I have seen the video of the people made by it in society.
Glad to know about this.
It's very deep pleasure.
He's got the Kiya Ne and the others, and I'm very fond of his mind.
The purpose behind this scheme is to increase the life-sufficiency of anybody's healthcare.
Marines found in gene medicinal plants are cheaper than 50 percent to 90 percent in comparison to the deserts of brandedai .
In this way, the ordinary people, especially the deer, have to eat everyday, and the elderly have a lot of financial eye.
I can profit a lot of money.
Here you buy generic deer is the standard of the world health system.
That's why good trees are available at cheap prices.
The entire country has established more than one-and-a-half generation centres.
There you're not only getting the price of the trees, but the people who want to find jobs personally have a new job.
The priceless deer is available in the 'Amrit' stores of the hospital in the Prime Minister's Indian Genetic Centre.
All this is the only purpose in Pil- what is the service of health for poor people in the country.
What aims to create a healthy rich India.
My dear patriots, in Maharashtra, Mr. Mangesh is a fo ' or shear in the narendramodi app.
It was my attractive photo.
A child joins the program to clean the Morna river with her grandfather.
I knew the citizens of Akola had organized a purifying ground for cleaning the Morna river according to Swachha Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna river has flown 12 months ago.
Elle must be flowing only during the rainy season.
The river is full of casket and pole and is painful.
The river and its shores are dragged into plenty of dirt.
On the first step of Mission Clean Morna on January 13, a day before the Makar Sankranti, the two of Morna rivers were cleaned in the four-kilometer area.
In this scheme of Mission Clean Morna, more than 400 people in Akola, more than 100 government structures, curriculum students, cookers, elders, mothers and sisters, all participated in this.
2018 January 20th and this purifying people.
The program will continue every Saturday morning until the Morna river gets completely dirty.
If someone's going to do something, it's not impossible.
Great changes can be brought through the public.
Congratulations to the people of Akola, the district administration and the corporation rulers of the district.
Your effort will be inspired by other people in the country.
Priyape's countrymen, you'll be listening to padmapuras these days.
There will be reports about this matter in newspapers and TVs.
If you look at it, you'll be proud of something.
I'm proud of all the great ones between us.
Naturally, this is the ordinary person in our country, especially the supervision and the eye, and the pride.
It's routine to give Padma awards every year.
It's been enchanted for the last year.
I'm gonna suggest any citizen.
Because all the operations are through the Olyn, it has sufficient v.
In a way, the election process for these priests has changed.
You'll be surprised to the very common people of Padma Puraskar Khu.
Generally, in cities, in newspapers, in TV, those who don't attend conferences, keep paying tributes.
It's not famous for a person to give it, but it's important for his work.
Mr.
The priest of Arwind Gupta is Kay.
The student of IID Kapur, who dedicated life to these Aravindan kiosks, will be happy to you.
He's been abandoned to grow scientific fashions in cookies for four decades.
Leave the cookies without use and try to inspire scientific experiments.
For this, in the schools of the country, the film made in 18 languages is inspired by Kai Kui.
Strange lives, surprisingly dedicated.
A story like this is from Sithava Joddatti in Karnataka.
Don't just tell the goddess of women's protection.
In the last few decades, Balgaw has made an important contribution to changing the lives of women.
They surrendered to Goddess when they were seventy years old.
Only for the good of Peeta Goddesses.
It's not just that, Dulit did the work of women's weird and unforeseen.
There'll be Kay about Maju Shyam in Madhya Pradesh.
Mr.
Maju Shyam was born in a poor family, a tribal family.
I didn't work to live, but the traditional tribals didn't have special interest in paintings.
Because of this interest, it is respected not all over the world.
In countries like Netherlands, Germany, England, Italy, there is a demonstration of his pictures.
Identifying the talent of Kirtiku Majju Shyam to India abroad, he gave Padmasree.
The story of the tribal woman Laxmiki of Kerala will be surprised to bow down to you.
Laxmiki lives in a place where Kallar is.
In Kurumka, the tribals live in the hut of hydrated huts.
Hundreds of green trees are built on the strength of your memory.
It's specially precise to make a desert of serpent.
Laxmiji serves the society through his own knowledge about green peasants.
The world's familiars have recognized this personality and respected the country to give a contribution to the society.
I'd like to say another name.
It's the name of Subhasini Mistry, 75, West Bengal.
They chose them for priests.
To build a hospital, washed the utensils in other houses, it's a palace when they operated vegetables.
At the age of 23, his husband died without treatment.
This incident became a motivation to build a hospital for the poor.
Thousands of poor people are given free treatment at the hospital to build their hardships.
I'm sure there are many such men and women who don't know anybody in our extraordinary Vasundhara.
Don't recognize such people, it's good for the society.
Padma Puruskar is a medium.
But I want to tell people to live for the society around us, to dedicate ourselves to the society, to live millions of lives for a whole society with some specialty.
Bring them to the society sometimes.
They don't work for honors
But we're inspired by their actions.
Sometimes in school, invite them to colleges and listen to their experiences.
Beyond the priests, there must be some effort of society.
Priyape, every year on 9th January, we celebrate the expatriate Indian day.
On 9th January, Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the uninterrupted relationship between India and the world.
This year we have organized a program on the expatriate Indian day.
Towards the world, we have invited different parlments and mayors in India.
In that program, you and Indian leaders in many countries including Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portuguese, Mauritius, Fiji, Tansani, Kenya, Canada, Brin, Surinam, South Africa and America participated.
Living in different countries, I am very happy to serve the roots of India as well as to establish their strong relationship with India.
This time the European Union sent me a calendar.
In them, they lived in different countries and showed Indian contributions in different fields.
Our Indian people live in different countries of Europe - some work with cyber security, some are dedicated to Ayurveda, some of the poems of the society.
Some research the environmental differences, some contact the Indian texts.
Some drive the truck and build the gurudwara, some have built the mosque.
I mean, wherever our people are, they have put the soil in some way.
Thank you for the European Union to recognise the people of the world for identifying the people of India...
.
On 30th January, it's the memory day of the new priest of the priest.
We've been waiting for a martyr's day.
We offered honors to the great martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the country at 11.
The path of peace and ahimsa is the path of the father.
Whatever the pride of the community, the father of the community, whether it is a world, but a person, but a family, is what we say, it's all consistent.
They're not just principles.
We'll find out how well the bapo said things are.
If we observe the path of the papa, what would be better careful than that.
Please, please finish my words with the good wishes of 2018 for you.
Thank you very much.
Good luck.
