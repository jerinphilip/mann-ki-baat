Talking to the mind, December 2016, my dear countrymen, Namaskar
All of you wish a lot of Christmas .
Today's day is an opportunity to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in his life
Jesus Christ said - "The poor do not have our favor, we should accept"
Saint Luke has written in Gospell - "Jesus has not only served the poor but also appreciated the service made by the poor and this is the real empowerment "
A story associated with it is also very popular .
The story tells us that Jesus was standing near a temple treasury
Many rich people came, gave a lot of donations
Then there came a poor widow , and he cast coins of two copper .
In a way, two coin coins don't matter
It was very natural for the devotees to be in the mind standing there .
Then Jesus said that that widow woman has donated the most because others have given a lot, but this widow has given her everything.
Today is December 25, Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya ji is also Jayanti
Malviya ji , who awakens will and confidence in the Indian public , gave a new direction to modern education .
He paid tribute to Jayanti
Just two days ago, in Malviya ji's Tapobhoomi Banaras, I got the opportunity to launch many development works
I have also laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya Fancer Center in Varanasi
This is being constructed in this entire area, this Ancer center will not only be a big boon for the people of North-Eastern region, but to Jharkhand-Bihar
Today is the birthday of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee .
These countries can never forget Atalji ' s contribution
Under his leadership , we also raised the country in the nuclear power .
Be a party leader, be a member of Parliament, a minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji honoured an ideal in every role
I salute them on Atalji ' s birthday and pray to God for their best health .
The privilege of working with Atal ji as a worker was found .
Many memories come in front of eyes .
This morning, when I tweeted, I've shared an old video too
How did Atal ji get the privilege of affection as a small worker, only after seeing that video
Today, on the day of Christmas, the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes.
Two new schemes are being started in a way
In the whole country, villages or cities, educated or illiterate, what is the cashless, how can the cashless business run, how can the cash be bought - there is an environment of curiosity all around
Everyone wants to learn from each other
To promote this, the mobile banking gets encouraged, so the habit of e-payment has started, so the Government of India has started the scheme for customers and for small traders.
There is a plan to encourage customers - Lucky Client Scheme and scheme to encourage traders - igidhan Business Scheme
Today, on December 25, as a Christmas deal, fifteen thousand people will get reward from the draw system and every fifteen thousand rupees will be rewarded for one thousand rupees and this is not just for one day today, this plan is going to start from today to 100 days
Every day, fifteen thousand people will get a reward of one thousand rupees
In 100 days, millions of families are going to reach crores of rupees, but you will be entitled to reward when you mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, PI
FSS - You will use as many digital payments as they are, the draw will come out on the basis of that
At the same time, there will be a big draw in the week for such customers, in which the reward will also be in lakhs and after three months, on April 14, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth is Jayanti, that day there will be a bumper draw, which will have crores rewards
Digiding Business Scheme is mainly for traders
Merchants themselves join this scheme and also add customers to make their business cashless
Such traders will also be rewarded separately , and these rewards are in the number of thousands .
Merchants will also have their own business and there will be rewards from above .
These schemes, especially all sections of the society, poor and low middle classes, have been made by keeping them at the center and so who buy more than 50 rupees and buy less than three thousand rupees, they will get the benefit.
The one who buys more than Rs 3 , 000 will not get the benefit of this reward .
Poorly poor people can also buy goods through Feature phones, ordinary phones, sell goods and pay money and they can also become beneficiaries of this reward scheme
In rural areas also people can buy through APS and they can also win rewards .
Many will be surprised, today there are about 30 million RuPay cards in India, out of which 20 million poor families, who are people with public money accounts, are with them
These 30 million people can immediately become part of this prize scheme .
I am confident that the countrymen will be interested in this system and those young people who are next to you will definitely know these things, you will ask them a little, they will tell them
Hey, if your family also has a 10th-12th child, then that too will teach you good things
It ' s very simple - like you send HatsApp from the mobile phone, not the same simple
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know how to use Technology in the country, how to do e-payment, how to do online payment, its awareness is growing very fast
In the last few days, cashless business, cashless business, increased 200 to 300 percent
The Government of India has taken a very big decision to promote this .
Merchants can imagine how big this decision is
The traders who will do digital transactions, will develop the online payment system instead of cash in their business, such traders will be CID
Encome Tax has been discounted
I congratulate all the states of the country, also congratulate the Union Territory
Everyone has carried forward this campaign in their own way .
Andhra Chief Minister Shriman Chandrababu Naidu has also created a committee, which is considering several schemes for this.
But I saw that the governments have also started many schemes in their way, implemented
Someone told me that the Assam Government has decided to give 10 percent discount on payment of property ta and business license ee
Branch of rural banks get at least two digital transactions from 75 consumers between January and March, then they will get 50 thousand rupees reward from the government.
By March 31, 2017, he has announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh under the government's Tom Panchayat for Digi-Transaction to 100 digital transactions.
He has decided to give a reward of Rs 5 thousand to the first 10 farmers who use digital payment for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers for the farmers.
I congratulate the Assam Government, but in this way I congratulate all governments for initiative
Many organisations have also made several successful experiments to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers .
Someone told me, "GN-Gujarat Narmada Caley Certiliers " immited, which mainly works as fertilizers, they facilitate farmers, so a thousand PSC machines are sold where they sell, and in a few days, 35 thousand farmers have made 5 lakh fertilizers through digital payments and all this done in just two weeks and it is fun that 27 percent increase in the sale of GNE manure has increased in comparison to last year"
In our economy, in our economy, informal sector is very big and most of these people are given wage money, work money or salary cash, salaries are given in Wash and we know, due to which the workers are exploited.
If you get 100 rupees, 80 get, 80 get 50 and insurance like health sector, there are many other facilities, they are deprived of it.
But now the cashless payment is going on
Direct money is being deposited in the bank
In a way the informal sector is getting converted, exploitation is shutting down, it had to be cut, it was also shutting down and the worker, such a poor person has been able to get full money
The benefits that others get together are also entitled to profit
Our country is the most young country .
Technology is easy to us
A country like India must be at the forefront of this region .
Our youngsters have made a lot of progress from Startp
This digital movement is a golden opportunity
With our young new ideas, with new texchanology, the strength that this region can give with new methods should be given, but we should join with full force in the campaign to free the country from black money, corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge people every month to talk about "Mann" that you give me your suggestions, tell me your ideas and thousands of thousands on MyGov, this suggestion on NarendramodiApp, I can say, 80-90 percent suggestions came in connection with the fight against corruption and black money, discussions of banquet
When I saw all these things , I can say fatly that I divide it into three parts
Some people have written in detail what difficulties are happening to the citizens in what kind of inconveniences are happening
The second section of the writers is those who have stressed mostly on those things that such a good work, the work of the country's good, so sacred work, but despite that, what is happening, how new ways of dishonesty are being searched, people have also mentioned it.
And the third is the section, who has supported what has happened, but along with this fight should move forward, corruption, black money should be completely destroyed, should take harsh steps for it, then should take such a big force and write people are also there.
I am grateful to the countrymen that you have helped me by writing so many letters
Mr . Gurumani only wrote on MyGov : This step to curb black money is eligible for promotion .
We are facing problems to citizens, but we are all fighting against corruption and we are happy with the cooperation we are giving in this fight.
We are fighting against corruption, black money etc. like Military Forces I
This feeling is being exposed from every corner of the country, which Gurumani has written only
We ' re all experimenting it .
But this is true, when the public suffers, suffers, then who will be the person who does not suffer
The more pain you suffer, the more I suffer
But for a best goal, to cross a high intention, when it works with a clear intention, then between these sufferings, between sadness and pain, the countrymen remain with courage.
These people are actually the agent of change - viz .
I thank people for another reason that they have not only raised problems, but have also responded to those selected people who are trying to mislead the people.
How many rumors have been spread
And how much effort was made to paint the fight like corruption and black money in the colour of communalism
Someone spread rumors, the spelling mistake written on the note, someone said, the price of salt has increased, someone rumored, 2000 notes are going to go, 500 and 100 are also going to go, but I saw, even though the rumors of the countrymen have not been able to drown anything.
Not only this, many people came to the ground, through their creative, exposed rumors by their intelligence power, exposed rumors and brought the truth.
I also bow down to this strength of the people
My dear countrymen, I am feeling clear, I am feeling every moment - when hundreds of millions of countrymen stand with you, nothing is impossible and the masses are the form of God and the blessings of the people become the blessings of God.
I thank the people of the country, I bow to them that people have participated with full enthusiasm in this superiority against corruption and black money.
I wanted that fight against corruption and black money in the House, for political parties, also for political funding, widespread discussion
If the House had gone, it would have been a good discussion
Those who are spreading rumors that political parties have all the exemptions, this is wrong
The law is similar to all, whether it is a person, an organization or a political party, everyone has to follow the law and I will have to do it.
Those who can not openly support corruption and black money, they are all late to find the government's shortcomings.
One thing comes, why do the rules change again and again
This government is for public-generation ID
Government strives to take public eedback continuously
Told the public and the Janardhana, there is difficulty, due to which rule, what can be the path of it be discovered - every moment the government is a sensitive government, keeping in mind the happiness and discomfort of the people, changes the rules, so that people's problems are reduced.
On the other hand, I had said on the first day, on the 8th, this fight is unusual I
How many powers have been associated in the black business of dishonesty and corruption for 70 years - When I have decided to meet such people, they also adopt new ways to defeat the government.
When they adopt new methods, we also have to adopt a new way to cut it.
You throw, then I'm slaughtered, because we've decided that corrupt people, black businesses, to eradicate black money I
On the other hand, letters of many people have come to this point, in which kinds of rigging are happening, how new ways are being searched, it is discussed.
I want to congratulate the dear countrymen with the heart of one thing
Today you will see on TV, in newspapers, new people are being caught everyday, notes are being caught, raids are being done, good people are being caught.
How is this possible
I'll tell the secret I
Secret is that I ' m getting information from people I
The information that comes from the government system is coming from many more ordinary citizens and most of us are getting success, it is getting due to public awareness.
Someone can imagine - How much aware citizen of my country is taking to expose such elements and most of the information that is coming is getting success.
I am sure the government wants to give such a Fe-mail address for this, I created for them.
Can also send it to MyGov, I can also send it
The government is committed to fighting all such evils and it is very easy to fight when you have cooperation .
Third letters and writers group is like this, they are also in a large number of ICF
He says - Modi ji, do not get tired, do not stop and take as many tough steps as you can, but now you have caught the path once, then I have to reach the ground.
I thank all those who write such a letter, because their letter also has faith in a way, blessings are also I.
I assure you that this is not a complete break, it is just the beginning, this war is to win and the question of tiredness arises, there is no question of stopping and there is no question of retreating on the blessings of hundreds of millions of people.
You know, in our country, a law of "Benami property" was made in nineteen ight nineteen hundred eighties, but never made its rules, did not do it, so he was lying in cold storage I
We have dragged it out , and We have made the law of an extraordinary property .
The law will do its job in the coming days
Whatever we have to do for the country, this is our priority I
My dear countrymen, in the last word of "mind", I had said that even among these difficulties our farmers hardly worked and broke record of last year in sowing I
These are auspicious signs in terms of agriculture
The work of this country, be a farmer of this country, be a young man of this country, the hard work of all these is bringing new colors today.
In the past, on the Earth of the world, India has named its name in many areas with great pride.
The result of the continuous efforts of our countrymen is, India's global ranking is showing an increase in ICD through different indicators.

For this, I express gratitude to all the MPs of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, I express gratitude to millions of Divya people of the country.
Our government is conmitted to the Divyas

Our efforts and trusts were strengthened by our divine siblings when they brought four medal wins in Paralympics
He not only increased the value of the country by his victory, but also surprised people with his capacity.

I am very happy today that after passing these laws for the benefit of the people of Divya, the people will have more job opportunities.
Reservation limit in government jobs has been increased to 4 .
Special provisions have also been made for education, convenience and grievances of the Divyas from this law.
How sensitive the government is taking the Divyas, you can estimate from the fact that the Central Government has installed four thousand three hundred fifty camps for the people of Divya in the last two years.
Five lakh eighty thousand Divyang brothers and sisters spent the amount of three hundred Bawan crores
Government has passed a new law in line with the feeling of nited nations
