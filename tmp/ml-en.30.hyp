Prime Minister Mr.
On the date of October 20, 2016, the Tamilnadu language of the special launch conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population at 11 in the morning.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is the birthday of Hockey magician Dhyanchand on August 29.
This day the nation is celebrated as National Sports Day.
I pay attention to Dhyanchand and remind you of his contributions.
In 1928 and 1932, he played an important role in obtaining gold medal in Hockey in hippopic competitions.
We've heard Bradman's name all those who love cricket.
He said about Dhyanchand that His Scores Golds Light Runs.
Dhyanchandji was a living example of Sportsman Spirit and patriotism.
Once in a game in Kolkata, a protester was hit by a hockeystick on Dhyanchand's head.
Then there was 10 minutes left to end the game.
Dhyanchand said he had three rounds in that ten minutes and answered the rounds.
My dear countrymen, during the time of Man Key Ban, there are many opinions in MyGav or Narendramodi App.
Different.
But this time everyone wants me to say something about Rio Olympics.
I'm so honoured that the Prime Minister of the country is so excited about Olympics and so much awake to the ordinary people.
There is so much love and so much awareness among the citizens of India in the field of non-cricket games.
Reading this message is a very inspirational thing about me.
Mr.
Ajeet Singh, who wrote in the Nadarmodi App, please tell me this time about the girls' education in Manki Bay and join them in the games, because they're pride of the country by gathering medals in Rio Olympics.
Mr.
Sachin writes a man in Manki Bay, who must say about Sindhu, witness, Deepa Karmar.
We got the medals we got girls.
Our daughters have once proven they're not behind anyone.
They are from India's north, south, east or any other corners.
It seems that many girls in India have been missioning to infiltrate India.
Shikhar Takur wrote in MyGav that we could have a better performance in Olympics.
He wrote, "Adarnian Motisar, we've got two medals in Rio, for the first time.
But I'd like to invite your attention to whether our performance is good.
No answer.
We need a long distance in Sports.
Our parents still focus on studies and academic matters.
The society still considers Sports to lose time.
It's important to change this thought.
The encouragement of the society has to be increased.
No one can do this better than that.
Mr. Like this.
Saty Prakash Mehra wrote in the Narendramodi App : In Man Key Bay, the Extra Creekular Activities should be concentrated.
Especially for Sports, children and youth should be encouraged.
Thousands of years have been explained in a way that's the same thought.
We can't deny that we can't perform a demonstration we hoped.
In some species, our sportsmen have seen good performances in India, but they haven't been able to expect a good performance here.
We got only two medals on the medal list.
But if you don't get the medal, you'll see our stars in many species showing a good show.
See, our congratulations at the shooting pointed to Bindraji, and he lost the medal in a very small difference.
In Gymnastics, Deepa Karmak also came to the fourth place with a good performance.
Medal was lost in a very small difference.
How can we forget that Olympics is the first Indian priest to gain the Gymnastics Final
This is what happened in Tennys about Sania Mirza and Rohn Boppenn and Jody.
We showed a good performance at Altitude.
P.
T.
The first time in 32 years after heat, Lila Babber graduated the Track and Field Final.
It's a pleasure to know that after 36 years, Mahila Hockey team reached Olympics.
For the first time in the last 36 years, the man reached the out stage.
Our team is very strong.
The Argentina team gained medal is only one time in the tournament.
Those who were defeated...
He was a player of India.
We'll make good for the next time.
In Boxing, Vikas Krishna Yadav reached the uarter final.
But Bronze didn't get medal.
Many sportsmen, like Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhokanal, and his Das were good.
But, dear countrymen, we have lots of things to do.
But if you do it again, maybe we'll be disappointed again.
I've announced a committee.
The Indians go deep into the subject.
We'll study what kind of training is going on in the world.
We'll prepare a framework for how to improve.
2020, 2024, 2028.
State governments should make such committees and think of what we can do in the Sports sector, what we can do to each of our states.
States must choose one or two species of their strength.
I advise the Sports Associations that they must neutralize.
I advise every citizen of India to give me the opinion of someone interested by Narendramodi App.
Write the government, discuss it and give it to the government.
State governments discuss their views with discussions.
We're gonna get ready.
We have to move forward with a view to a good level in the Sports sector, a country of 60 million people, 65 percent of the youth.
Dear countrymen, September 5 is a teacher day.
I spend a lot of time with students on a teacher day for many years.
He spent time like a student.
I've learned a lot of things from small children.
As long as I was concerned, September 5 was the teacher's day and the teacher's day.
But this time I have to go to G20 lunch.
So I decided to express my feelings in Man Keeba.
There's teacher as much as the mother's position in life.
I've seen teachers who are worried about freedom more than myself.
They give life to their students, for their disciples.
Now, after Rio Olympics, there's a discussion about Pullela Gopichand.
He's a Sportsman. He's gonna keep an example of how to be a good teacher.
Today I see Gopichand as a good teacher than a player.
On the teacher day, I salute Pullela Gopichand, his penance, his dedication to Sports, his method of enjoying the success of his students.
We always feel the contribution of teachers in our whole life.
September 5, President of India, Dr.
Sarve Plain is the birthday of Radhakrishnanji.
The country takes the day as a teacher.
Even if he reached any position in his life, he always tried to live as a teacher.
Not just that, he always used to say, "The student of Ullah is a good teacher who never dies.
In the rank of the princess, it is a surprising life that has become a teacher and has become a teacher's mind to keep the student alive inside.
Radhakrishna lived.
I remember many stories of my teacher.
Because our little village teachers were our heroes.
My teacher's letter, now he's 90 years old, but he's still getting every month.
He's got a hand-written letter.
There'll be signs where he read all the books for a month, and there'll be advances.
Whatever I did all the month, they were right in his view or not.
Even today, he seems to teach me in the classroom.
I'll tell you he's giving me the Current Pondence Corce tonight.
It'll be wonderful if he sees his handwritings at the age of thirty-three.
My letter is very bad and if someone sees a good letter, my mind will look very respectful.
You can have my experience.
The good experiences from your teachers will change the vision of the teachers from the world, it will be proud that we all are responsible for the pride of our teachers in society.
In the Nandermodi app, you must share some events related to your teachers, teachers, something inspiration.
It's very expensive to see teachers' contributions with students' eyes.
My dear countrymen, the Ganesh festival is coming closer.
Ganesh changes the segments.
Our country, our society, our family, should not be divided into each other's lives.
But when you talk about the Ganesh festival, it's natural to remember world-wide sculpture.
The General Ganesh festival was started.
He made this religious celebration a dream of awakening the country.
Festival of social culture.
In the Ganesh festival, there are detailed discussions about the problems of social life.
The programmes of the society are being organized for new opportunities and temptations.
And the wizard he gave, may be the wizard that Swarraj is our birth right.
The wizard was powerful for freedom.
Even today, the Ganesh festival has started not only in Maharashtra but in all parts of India.
Every young man has a lot of preparations for this festival, and will be very excited.
Some people still try to persuade the universal wise who moved forward.
There are discussions about common matters, articles are performed, flowers are performed.
In its visions, the subjects of the touch of society are very artistic.
In a way, a big campaign of general education is going on through the Ganesh festival.
Inspired by the inspiration that the world's tailor, Swarraj, is our birth-right right.
But we live in free India.
Today's spell, Suraj-General. It's our right.
We have to go to Suraj.
It'll be our first genius.
Based on this spell, can't we send a message to the Ganesh festival
Come on.
I'm inviting you.
It's true that the festival is the strength of society.
Festival gives new life to the person and society.
Life is impossible without a festival.
But it has to be formed according to time.
This time many people have written to me specially about the Ganesh festival and the Durga Puja.
Mr. is about their prevailing environment.
A man named Shankar Narayan Prasad says, "Do not use Ganesh statues made of Plaster of Paris."
Don't use Ganeshji made of soil in the village.
The statues made of Plaster of Paris are not suitable for the environment.
He and others have been very painful.
I'm also asking you to return to our old tradition by making statues of Goddess Ganesh and Durga.
The protection of environment, the protection of our rivers and lakes, the pollution produced in it and the protection of the small species of the water is also the Goddess.
Ganesh is Vighnahar.
So, we shouldn't make a defective generator.
I don't know how much you will accept.
But it's not just me, but many say.
Many people have heard of it many times - a statue of Pune , Shri .
Abhijit Dhond Fale, Nisarg Mithra of Kolhapur, Vidarbha's Nisarg-Katta, Gyan Prabodini of Pune, Girgaoncha Raja of Mumbai.
Several such institutions are very fond of creating a mud generator, propaganda.
Environmental friendly Ganeshotsav is also a social service.
There's still time for Durga Puja.
The old families who built the statues will be employed...
The environment does not harm if it is made by the jungle of the river in the lake.
You and Ganesh Chaturthi have many good hopes.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna will declare Mother Teresa on 4 September.
Madar Teresa used to serve the poor of India throughout his life.
They were born in Albanie.
His language wasn't English.
But they made life, they were very unhappy to serve poor people.
It is natural for all Indians to feel proud that Mother Teresa, who has served the poor throughout his life, is getting a holy status.
In this celebration of September 4, 125 crore people, the Government of India is sending an official representative team under the leadership of our Foreign Minister Shrimati Sushma Swaraj.
We can learn anything from the saints and the princes and the princes.
Anything we're getting, we're learning, something's going to do well.
My dear patriots, how many changes will be when the development becomes a population.
The power of the people is considered to be another form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made successful efforts to pursue Ganga with the help of 5 State Governments.
On 20th of this month, a meeting of the village chiefs on the banks of the Ganges was called in Allahabad.
There were men and women.
They came to Allahabad and the village chiefs of Ganga shrine , in their villages on the open entrance of the Ganges , will stop the habit of urinating the toilets , and will be able to cooperate fully in cleaning Ganga and not to destroy their village Ganga .
For this vision, some from Uttrakhand, some from Bihar, some from Jharkhand, some people appreciate everyone from West Bengal to Alahabad.
I congratulate the Ministers and the Ministers concerned with the Government of India for bringing this idea down.
I am grateful to the Chief Ministers of the five states, in the name of the great Kalavaype of cleaning the Ganges.
Dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch my mind.
My mind has a special respect for those people who form that idea.
On July 15, more than 1,700 students of more than 1700 schools of Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh together wrote letters to their parents.
Some wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi, some wrote in Chhattisgarh.
In that letter, they told their parents that they wanted toilets in their homes.
That's why they asked some people wrote that they didn't celebrate their birthday this year, but they must have made a toilet.
It's been done by children from seven to ten years of age.
Next day when he reached school, he had a letter to the teacher.
It's very impressive. It's a vital interference.
My parents were given in those letters promised to make a toilet in a fixed date.
Whoever had this idea in mind, appreciates them and those students who tried it.
I appreciate my parents.
Because they decided to take their children's letters seriously and make a toilet.
This is our inspiration.
Malma, a girl of fifteen years of age in Kopal district of Karnataka.
This kid swears against his family.
She didn't even have food.
Malma satyagraha says she wants a toilet in her house, not for a good dress, but not to eat a sweet sweet snack.
The family didn't have financial skills.
The boy stood firm in the rock.
The village chief, Mohammad Shafi, who was serving for Malma Town, arranged for ten thousand rupees and made a toilet within a week.
The village chief, like Mohammad Shafi, deserves the strength of a girl named Malma.
How is the way to solve the problems
This is the power of the people.
My dear countrymen are dreams of all Indians, self-sufficiency.
Some Indians are obvious.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
If not everyone is in a way, it's connected to another way.
Everyone takes part in their own.
He's sending news about new efforts.
The Government of India has taken a new idea forward: Make a two-minute, three-minute poor film, make this short film India government...
Web site will get information about this.
In this short film competition, the successors will be awarded Gandhiji on October 2.
I want TV channels to tell you that you also have to come out to make films like this and compete.
The activity and the dust will be strong for manufacture.
There will be new printings, new methods, new inspiration.
.
It'll be through the participation of people and ordinary artists.
I don't want a big studio to make films or a big camera.
Now we can make films with our mobile phone cameras.
Come on...
Let's move.
I'm inviting you.
My dear folks, India has always wanted us to have a good relationship with our neighbors and be alive.
An important thing happened in the last days.
Our President, honored Pranab Mukherjee, inaugurated a new program in Kolkata.
Akashwani Mithri Channel.
Some people may think the President should inaugurate a radio channel.
But it's not a radio channel.
It's a big red.
Our neighborhood is Bangladesh.
We know that the Bangladeshi country and the West are still living with the same cultural tradition.
Here ' Akashwani Mithri ' and ' Bangladesh Baitaar ' are there .
They share their programs, the bags of the two sides will enjoy the events of the sky.
Skyman's contribution is very big in forming a person's relationship.
The President inaugurated it.
I'm thankful to Bangladesh for they cooperated with us.
I wish the sky to share myself in foreign countries.
My dear countrymen, you gave me the job as Prime Minister.
But I'm also a man like you.
Sometimes some distorted events touch my heart more.
Such emotional events create new energy, inspire
This is the inspiration to do something for the people of India.
Last day, I got a heart-white letter.
A mother of about 84 years old, Retired Teacher, gave me a letter.
If she didn't sell the name, she would like to talk to you with her mother's name today.
In the letter, Mother wrote, "When I had to leave the gas subsidies, I left gas subsidies and then forgot it.
But last day a man of yours came and gave me a letter.
I received a letter of thanks for Give It's up.
As far as I am concerned, the letter of the Prime Minister of India is not less than a pupil.
I tried to burn all the people who left the gas subsidies.
I wanted to give the letter directly to my representative.
More than a million people are trying to burn.
That's what she found my hand.
She wrote to me that's a good thing.
Your effort to save poor mothers from smoke in the harvest is congratulation.
I'll be 90 soon, retire teacher.
So I'm sending you a contribution of 50,000 rupees.
You should also use poor mothers to get rid of the smoke of the bed.
As a common teacher, you can imagine a mother who lives with penis for a couple of rupees poor mothers and sisters to get rid of the smoke of the harvest, to give gas conceives.
I don't care about 50 rupees.
That mother's thinking is important.
My country is able to believe in the future by the blessings of millions of mothers and sisters.
I haven't written that letter as Prime Minister.
Straight Listed: "Modi brother...
I inspire the mother who's always trying to do good by having hurt herself.
THE THAT SHOUGHING THE SHOUGHING THE THAT INDIANTION OF THE OF THE SHOUGHERS OF THE OF THERES.
My dear patriots, we've been suffering due to tremors last year.
But the month of August was full of trouble due to continuous rains.
There was water again in some parts of the country.
State governments, central governments, local free establishments, social institutions and citizens tried hard to do all that.
But there were reports about white news and other news.
It must have been more remembered.
The greatest consequences of the unit will be reminded of this year's August month.
August 2016, the powerful political barriers, the unsuccessful parties, nearly 90 particles of the country, together with all the parties in the Parliament, passed the GST law.
Its credit is for all parties.
The example of how big things can be done if all the parties walk together in a direction.
Likewise, all the political parties in the country talked together about the events in Kashmir and the situation there.
Message for the world and the rebels.
We have expressed our feelings with the citizens of Kashmir.
On the contradiction I made with all the parties related to Kashmir, one thing was clear from everyone's opinion.
If you make it clear in short words, Ikya and Mamata would have been so much.
Our opinion is that all the people of the country, from the village chiefs to the prime minister, whose life is in Kashmir, whether it is a young man or a security officer, but that loss is ours.
It's our own people.
It's our country.
Those young kids, who try to make peace in Kashmir, will have to answer these innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big.
It's full of varieties.
As a society, as a government, to strengthen the responsibility of all of us, to strengthen the units, to make it more clear in relation to the units of the nation with variations.
So, make the country a funny future.
It will happen.
I believe in the strength of hundred and twenty-two people.
That's all today.
Thank you very much.
