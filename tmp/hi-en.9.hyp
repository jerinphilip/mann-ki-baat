I once again congratulate these daughters for their adventure, to increase the reputation of Navy, to increase India's honor and especially to the world that the daughters of India are not less - these messages
Sense of Adventure who does not know
If we see the development journey of human race then progress has arisen in the womb of some adventure .
The development takes birth only in the lap of Adventure
Intends to pass some taxes, the meaning of doing something away from leak, something else ordinari, I can do something - these feelings, those who do good, but for ages, people get inspiration
In the past you must have seen many new things about Mount Verest climbers have come to mind and for centuries verest has been challenging human race and brave people have also accepted that challenge .

My dear countrymen
"In relation to the game many times, about the players, you have heard some things from me and the last time our hero of the Commonwealth Games, our minds, were telling us through this program - Namaskar Sir
I'm speaking to the image Yadav Noida, I'm a regular citizen of your mind and today I want to talk to you about your mind. Nowadays the summer holidays have started and as a mother I see children spend most of the time while playing the Internet games, when we were younger, we used to play most of the outdoor games, as was a game in which 7 stone pieces hit him with a ball and was high, lost, all these games have lost today .
My request is to tell you about some traditional games of generation nowadays, so that they also get interested towards this, thank you
"Chhavi Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call"
It is true that the games that were ever street, part of every child's life are becoming less today
These games were special parts of summer holidays .
Sometimes in the full afternoon, then after eating in the night, without worry, the children of the children used to play for hours and hours, and there are some games that used to play together, whether the whole family was beaten or knife, lost, lattu or glassed, not know. The countless games used to be part of the childhood of Kashmir from Kanyakumari, Kamrup to Katch.
Yes, it may be that in different places they were known with different names, like now this game is known by many names.
No one knows how many names are Lagori, Satolia, Seven Stones, Dikori, Satodia
There are two types of games in traditional games
There are also doors, indoor too
The unity behind the diversity of our country can be seen in these games as well
The same game is known in different places, different names .
I am from Gujarat I know there is a game in Gujarat, which is called Chomal-Isto
They are played with codies or tamarind seeds or diges and with 88 square boards
This game was played in almost every state .
In Karnataka it used to be called Chachabara, Attu in Madhya Pradesh
In Kerala, Pakedakali in Maharashtra, Champal in Tamil Nadu, Dayam and Thyam, how many names were there in Rajasthan, but after playing, it is known that every state does not know language well
We also did these games .
Who will be one of us who has not played a gill in childhood
Gilli - Danda is a game played from village to cities .
In different parts of the country it is known by different names .
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karabilla .
In Orissa it is called Gulibari , then in Maharashtra it is called Financidalu .
Some games have their own season
Like flying kites is also a season
When everybody blows the kite when we play, we can reelly express them in the unife qualities
You must have seen many children, who are embarrassed, but when playing, they become very crazy
Epress God, the big ones who look serious, when they play, a child hidden in them comes out
Traditional games are made in such a way that along with physical capacity they also promote our local thinking, concentration, awareness, smoothness
And the games aren't just playing, they teach the values of life
Determining the goal, how to achieve firmness
How to create, team spirit, how to cooperate
In the past , I was seeing that our traditional games are being used nowadays for the International Personality Development and Interpersonal Skills in the training programs associated with business management and there is no age to play these games .
When Grandfather, grandfather and grandfather play all by taking them from the children, then what they say is not generation gap, he also gets touched
At the same time we also know our culture and traditions .
Many games make us aware of society, environment etc.
Sometimes there is anxiety that our game will not lose and it will not lose the game, and then we will lose childhood and then we will continue to listen to that poems - Take this wealth too, take this pride, even if you snatch my youth but return me two childhood lunch she will be the paper ship, she will be listening to the watery song of rain and that is why this traditional game, it is not to lose it today that school, clerics, young mandals come forward and promote these games
by crowd sourcing we can create a huge archive of our traditional games
Videos of these games can be made, in which rules of sports can be shown about the method of playing
Animation films can also be made so that our new generation, for whom this game is sometimes wonderful in the streets - they will see, play, play
My dear countrymen
India will officially host World Environment Day on 5th June .
This is a very important achievement for India , and it is introducing the growing leadership of India in the world to reduce climate change .
Theme of this time is Beat Plastic Pollution
I appeal to all of you, understanding the value of this theme, we all make sure that we do not use Polythene, Low Grade Plastic and a negative Empact on our nature, on Wild Life and on our health, try to reduce it
Go to World Environment Day's Website Weed-India2018 and there's a lot of suggestions given in a very interesting way - see, know and try to bring them down in their everyday life
When there is horrible heat, there is flood
The rain does not stop
If there is unbearable cold, then everyone talks about global warming, climaate change by becoming expert, but what makes things talk about
Being sensitive to nature, protecting nature, it should be our natural nature, in our rituals
In the last few weeks, we all saw that there was dust and dust in different areas of the country, heavy rains along with strong winds, which is unnecessary
There was also death and loss of goods
All these things are basically the result of change in weatherpattern, our culture, our tradition has not taught us to struggle with nature
We have to live with nature with harmony, stay together with nature
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this every step throughout his life .
When India speaks of climaate justifice today
When India played a major role in the Op21 and the Paris Agreement
When we united the whole world through the International Solar Alliance , all of them had a sense of fulfilling that dream of Mahatma Gandhi .
On this environmental day, we all think about what can we make our planet clean and green
How can you move forward in this direction
Can I innovative
Rainfall is going to come, we can take the goal of record plantation this time and not only plant trees but also arrange its maintenance till it grows
My dear countrymen and especially my young companions
You remember equally on June 21, not only you, we remember not only the whole world on June 21
For the whole world 21 June is celebrated as International Yoga Day and it has been accepted and people start preparations months ago .
These days are getting news, preparations for celebrating International Yoga Day are going on all over the world on June 21
This is the message of Yoga for Unity and Harmonious Society, which the world has experienced for the past few years
Sanskrit's great poet Bharatrihari wrote in his centuries ago, "Dheery yes, father Kshama Cha Janani Shantischiran Gehinisatya, Sunuryan Daya Cha Bhagni Bharata Man: Sanyam:
Shayya Landal DishoSpi Vasan, Dnyanamrita, the meals, Yas Kutimbin: Vad Sakha Kasmad Fear Yogin:
.
Centuries ago this thing has been said directly meaning that on doing regular yoga some good qualities become like relatives and friends .
Yoga creates courage which always protects us like a father
The feeling of forgiveness arises as the mother is for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend .
Bharatrihari has said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our children, mercy our sister, self-control our brother, our soil our bed and knowledge become our hunger eradicator
When so many qualities become a companion , the yogi conquers all kinds of fear .
Once again I appeal to all the countrymen to pursue their heritage of yoga and create a healthy , happy and goodwill nation
My dear countrymen
Today is 27 May .
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , the first Prime Minister of India , is the death anniversary .
I salute Panditji .
The memory of the month of May is linked to another thing and that is Veer Savarkar .
This was the month of May in 1857, when Indians showed their strength to the British
In many parts of the country , our young and peasants stood up against injustice showing their bravery .
Sadly , for a long time , we have been calling events of 1857 a rebellion or a soldier rebellion .
In fact , this incident was not only reduced but it was also an attempt to push our self - respect .
It was Veer Savarkar, who wrote that whatever happened in 1857 was not a rebellion but the first battle of independence
LIC of London including Savarkar
The heroes of India House celebrated its 50th anniversary with great fanfare .
It is also a wonderful coincidence that in the month when the first independent struggle of independence started, Veer Savarkar ji was born in that month
Savarkar ji ' s personality was full of characteristics
Both arms and scriptures were worshippers .
Usually Veer knows Savarkar for his bravery and his struggle against the British Raj but apart from all these he was a poet and social reformer who always emphasized goodwill and unity .
A wonderful description about Savarkar ji has been done by our beloved beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee .
Atal ji had said, "Sawarkar Mane Tej, Savarkar Mane Tyagi, Savarkar Mane Tapa, Savarkar Maane Element, Savarkar Mane Tarunya, Savarkar, Savarkar Mane arrow, Savarkar Mane Sword "
How exactly did Atalji depict
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution together .
Being a sensitive poet, he was also adventurous revolutionary .
My dear brother-son
I was watching a story on TV .
Our poor daughters of the raw settlements of Sikar in Rajasthan
Our daughters, who were forced to buy garbage from home to house - today they are stealing clothes to cover the poor by learning the work of sewing .
Here's daughters, apart from their clothes and their families, are stitching from normal to good clothes.
They're also courses of skill development along with this
Our daughters are now self - reliant
He is living his life with respect and has become a power for his family .
I wish these daughters full of hope and belief to their bright future .
He has shown that if you are determined to do something and determine it , success can be achieved in all the difficulties , and it is not just a matter of Sikar , you will find all this in every corner of India .
If you look at the neighborhood, you will be able to see how people defeat problems
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, enjoy tea there, there is talk and discussion with some of the people.
These discussions are political too, social too, there are also movies, players and players, there are problems of the country - it is such a problem - it should be solved - but often these things are limited to discussion only but some people are such, who move forward towards bringing changes from their works, with their hard work and passion, make it realistic.
D. Prakash Rao, who lives in the slums of Cuttack City of Orissa, has a similar story of making other dreams their own and fulfilling them .
Tomorrow I got the luck to meet D . Prakash Rao .
Shri Man D . Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades .
A slight tea seller, today you will be surprised to know that more than 70 children are filling the light of education in the lives of
He opened a school called ' Asha Assurance ' for children living in settlements and slums .
On which the poor tea sells 50 of its income
They arrange complete education, health and food to all the children coming to school
I congratulate D. Prakash Rao's hard work, his passion and the life of those poor children for giving new directions
They have finished the darkness of their life
"Who does not know this Veda-Vakya, Tamso Ma Jyotirgamya, but D. Prakash Rao has shown it by living"
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and the whole country
There will be a series of such inspirational events in front of you too .
There will be countless events .
Let us proceed positively
In the month of June , there is so much heat that people wait for rain and look at the clouds in the sky .
A few days later , people will wait for the moon .
Showing the moon means that the Eid can be celebrated
After one month ' s fast during Ramzan , the festival of Eid symbolizes the beginning of celebration .
I am sure all people will celebrate Eid with full enthusiasm
Children will get good Edi , especially on this occasion .
I hope the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bond of goodwill in our society .
Best wishes to everyone
My dear countrymen
Thank you very much for all
Once again , we ' re going to meet the next month .
Namaskar
.
