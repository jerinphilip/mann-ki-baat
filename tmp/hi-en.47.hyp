Talking to the mind, March 2015, my dear farmer brother and sister-in-law, greet you all
It is my good fortune that today I have got an opportunity to talk to my farmer brothers and sisters living in remote villages of the country.
And when I talk to the farmer, in a way I talk to the village, I talk to the villagers, I am also talking to the farm laborer.
I am also talking to the mothers working in those fields.
And in this sense, so far all the things that have happened to me, perhaps there is a different kind of experience.
When I thought to talk to the farmers, I did not imagine that people living in far-flung villages will ask me so many questions, give so many information, all your letters, a lot of questions, seeing this I was surprised.
How cautious you are, how active you are, and perhaps you're sorry that someone hears you.
First of all I salute you that by reading your letters, the pain I have seen in the troubles I have seen, despite tolerating so much, do not know what you have suffered
You surprised me, but I think of this mind, a training for me, an education opportunity.
And my farmer brothers and sisters, I assure you, as many things you have raised, as many questions as you have spoken on different aspects, I will bring awareness in all the government, I will bring condolences, my village, my poor, my farmer brother, in such a situation, he can not be forced to live.
I am surprised, the farmers have written things related to agriculture.
However, he has said many other subjects, how many problems are there with the villagers, how many problems are there with the mafia, the problems faced by natural calamities are fine, but the small traders around It is also facing troubles.
Someone has to drink dirty water in the village, someone has worried about the arrangement to keep their animals in the village, someone has even said that if the animal dies then there is no arrangement to remove it, the disease spreads.
That is, how much neglect has happened, and today the people sitting in the government are getting a strong message from this.
We have the right to rule when we pay attention to these small things too.
By reading all this, I sometimes felt embarrassed, what we did
I don't have the answer, what have you done
Yes, my heart has touched your words.
I will definitely try for change, authenticity, and will wake up the government on all its aspects, I will warn, I will try, I believe it.
I also know that if the rain was reduced last year, there was trouble.
This time untimely rains, hail falls, in a way above Maharashtra, in all the states, this trouble came.
And the farmer got upset in every corner.
The small farmer who works so hard and lives his life throughout the year, everything has been destroyed.
I am with you in the hour of this crisis.
All my departments of the government are studying the situation closely by staying in touch with the states, my ministers have also come out, take stock of the situation of every state, I have also told the state governments that by getting the center and the state, all the farmers trapped in these trouble can help the brothers and sisters as much as possible.
I assure you that the government will help you with full sympathy, in the hour of your crisis, with full readiness.
Efforts will be made to fulfill as much as possible.
The people of the village, the farmers have raised many issues.
The concern of irrigation is widespread.
There is no road in the village, he is also angry.
The prices of manure are increasing, the farmer's resentment is also on that.
Power is not getting.
Farmers also worry that children have to teach, get good jobs, they also have complaints.
Mothers and sisters have expressed their resentment over the drug addiction in the village.
Some have expressed their anger to me on the habit of eating tobacco to her husband.
I can understand your pain.
The farmer also says that the government's plans are very much to hear, but we do not reach.
Farmers also say that we do so hard, people fill stomach, but our pocket does not fill, we do not get full money.
When the goods go to sell, it is not a taker.
It has to be sold at a lower price.
Even if you yield more, you die, even if you yield less.
That is, the farmers have put their mind in front of me.
I assure my farmers, brothers and sisters, that I will also activate the State Governments, and also all our departments of the Government of India.
I will motivate to find ways to solve these problems at a fast pace.
I think your patience is decreasing.
Very natural, you have waited sixty years, I will try authenticity.
Farmer Bhaiyo, in the midst of your many questions, I have seen that the current land acquisition bill is discussed from almost all the states, its impact is more visible, and I am surprised how illusions have been spread.
Good, you asked me little questions.
I will try to reach you the truth.
You know the law of land acquisition came 120 years ago.
Even after the country was free, 60-65 years of the same law came and those who are running the movement by becoming sympathetic to the farmers today, they also ruled the country under this law, and the farmers who had to be.
Everyone believed that there should be a change in law, we also believed.
We were in opposition, we also believed.
A new law was brought in 2013 with a lot of funeral.
We also mixed shoulder with shoulder at that time.
If the farmer is good, then who will not accompany, we also gave it.
But after the law was implemented, some things came in our mind.
We thought perhaps we are betraying the farmer with it.
We do not have the right to deceive the farmer.
On the other hand, when our government was formed, there was a big voice from the states.
This law should be changed, the law should be improved, there are some shortcomings in the law, it should be fulfilled.
On the other hand, we saw that it was a year, no state was ready to implement any law and what did they do
The Maharashtra government had implemented, Haryana had done where there were Congress governments and those who claim to be farmers' friends, half of the compensation they had decided to pay in this Ordinance.
Now is this justice with farmers
So seeing all these things, we also felt that Bhai should have a little reconsideration.
There are some shortcomings in the funeral.
Perhaps the intention is not wrong, but there are shortcomings, then it should be corrected.
..
And we have no allegation that what the old government wanted, did not want
Our intention is that the farmers should be good, the children of the farmers should also be good, the village should also be good and that is why if there are any deficiencies in the law, then they should be removed.
So we have an authentic effort to overcome the shortcomings.
Now, one of the biggest deficiencies I will tell you, you will also be surprised to know that as many people are making such a big speech by becoming a farmer friend, they are not responding.
You know, there are 13 laws in different types of Hindustan in which most of the land is edited, such as railways, national highways, mine work.
You know, these 13 things have been excluded in the previous government's law.
Keeping out means that for the 13 types of work that the highest land is taken, the farmers will get the same compensation which was received from the earlier law.
Tell me, wasn't it
Wasn't it wrong
We corrected this and we said that even in these 13, the government may have to take land, even if it is for railways, even if it is to make highways, but its compensation should also be given to the farmer by four times.
We improved.
Someone tell me, is this reform anti-farmer
That's why we had to bring an ordinance.
If we did not bring the Ordinance, then the land of the farmer would go through the old law, he would not get any money.
Even when these laws were made, many people in the government had opposite voices.
When the lawmakers themselves made the form of law, they became angry and said that this law is not for the good of the farmers, nor for the good of the village, nor for the good of the country. is.
This law is only to fill the safes of the officers, to enjoy the officers, to promote Afsar Shahi.
It was said so far.
If all this was true then what should be improved or not
And so we have made efforts in the direction of removing the shortcomings and doing good to the farmers.
First of all, we worked, 13 laws which were outside the Land Acquisition Act and due to which the farmer was going to be the most damaged, we brought it under the purview of this new law so that the farmer gets full compensation and he gets all the rights. .
Now a wind was spread that Modi is bringing such a law that farmers will no longer get compensation, they will get less.
My farmer brother-in-law, I can't even think such a sin.
The compensation which has been fixed in the law made during the previous government of 2013 has not been differentiated.
We have accepted the matter of four times compensation.
Not only that, we have added that which was not in thirteen schemes.
Not only this, the land that will be acquired for urbanization will get 20 percent of the land owner so that he will always get financial benefits, we have continued this too.
The young man of the family got a job.
The farm laborer's children should also get a job, we have continued this too.
Not only that, we have added a new thing.
This new thing is a pair, which is the officer of the district, it will have to declare who will get a job in it, who will get a job, but the work will be available, the government will have to declare it in writing.
We have added this new thing to the government that the responsibility is i.
My farmer brother-in-law, we are aware of the fact that the government land is the first to be used.
After that, barren land should be used, then in the end it is mandatory, then the fertile land should be handled, and therefore it has been asked to conduct an immediate survey of wasteland, due to which it became the first priority.
The complaint of one of our farmers is correct that more land is grabbed than required.
Through this new law, I want to assure you that now how much land should be taken, its first investigation will be done, after which it will be decided that more land should not be grabbed than required.
Sometimes something is going to happen, something is going to happen, there is a lot of harm in its concern.
This social ID
MPAct Assessment
If the process continues for years in the name of A), keep on hearing, tell me, in such a situation a farmer will be able to make his decisions
If the crop is sown, then he will not think - no man, no know, if the decision comes, what will I do
And his 2-2, 4-4, the year will be spoiled and things will be stuck in bureaucracy.
Procedures will be forced to hold the feet of long, complex and in a way the farmers selling officers will be forced to write this, do not write it, write it, do not write it, it's all going to happen.
Shall I throw my own farmers once again in the clutches of this officer
I think he won't be okay.
The process was long, it was complex.
I have tried to simplify him.
My farmer brother-in-law has made law in 2014, but the states have not accepted it.
The farmer remained there.
States protested.
Tell me whether I listen to the states or not
Will I trust the states or not
Can such a big country run by disbelieving the states
And therefore, I believe that we should trust the states, especially in the Indian government, one, I want to believe, secondly, this is what we are improving in the law, removing the shortcomings, despite the steps we are taking for the betterment of the farmer, even if any state does not believe it, then they are free and therefore I want to tell you that all these confusions are being spread, they are illusions of anti-farmer.
The farmer is part of the conspiracy to keep the farmer poor.
The conspiracy to not take the country forward is part of the same.
It is to avoid, save the country too, save the farmer too.
Now ask the farmer in the village that brother is three sons, tell me what are you thinking
So he says that brother will cultivate a son, but two have to be employed somewhere.
Now the sons of the farmer of the village should also be employed.
He also has to work somewhere and work.
So what arrangements will be made for him.
So we thought that which is necessary for the good of the village, it is necessary for the good of the farmer, it is necessary for the employment of the children of the farmer, many such things should be added.
In the same way we are Jai-Jawan, Jai-Kisan.
Jai-Jawan means the defense of the country.
The farmer of Hindustan never retreats about the country's defense.
If there is any need in the field of security, then the land will have to be demanded by the farmers.
And I believe, he will give the farmer.
So we have added the matter of taking land for these works.
Nobody tells me the man of the village that the road should not be in the village.
If you want water in the field then you have to do the canal or not.
There are still poor in the village, who do not have a house to live.
Do not want land to build a house
Tell me what it is for industrialists
Is it for Dhanna Seths
Try to understand the truth.
Yes, I want to tell you on the injury of a sting, in the new Ordinance, any private industrialist, the private factory, the private businessman, the law that was made in 2013 at the time of acquiring the land, all the rules will apply to them.
These are going to be applicable to the law 2013 for the corporate.
Then why is this lie spread
My farmer brother-in-law, an illusion is spread that you will not get legal rights, you can not go to court, this is absolutely false.
No government in India can snatch your legal right.
Under this Constitution, Baba Saheb Ambedkar has given us, you can go to any court in India and knock the door.
So this lie has been spread.
Yes, we have tried to bring an arrangement to your door.
An authority has created, now it will work till the Authority district and the problems of the farmers of your district will be resolved in the district itself.
If you do not have satisfaction then you can go to the above court.
So we have this arrangement.
One is also told that if the land was acquired, then the law that returned in five years has been removed.
No, my farmer brother-son has said that whenever you make the project, make sure how many years you will complete it.
And if you do not complete in those years then it will be the same who will want the farmer.
And we have tied it from time to time.
What happens today, land was taken 40-40 years ago, but the government has not done anything so far.
So this can not be done.
So we have decided to bind the government in the border.
Yes, there are some projects that are completed in 20 years, if you believe that you have to put 500 km long railway line, then it will be time.
So write on paper already how long you will complete the brother.
So we have obstructed the government.
I have done the responsibility of the government.
Let me tell one more thing, farmers and brothers, sometimes the law that they make by sitting in the air conditioning room, they do not even know the true situation of the people of the village.
Now you see when the dam is formed, the reservoir is formed, then its rule is that there is a rule to get land according to the possibility of the maximum water in 100 years.
Now waters once in 100 years.
Water does not fill for 99 years.
Yet the land goes to the government, then what is happening in all the states today that the land has been taken on paper, the money has also been given.
But still he cultivates farmers on the ground.
Because once in 100 years when the water is filled, it will be removed for one year.
This new law was such that you could not cultivate.
We want that if the land is not submerged then the farmer should get an opportunity to cultivate.
And that's why the land should not be confessed to the farmer.
These flexibility was necessary.
In spite of giving land to the farmer, the land continued to get the benefit and instead of giving land, the rupees were also available.
So the farmer has double advantage.
It is also necessary to arrange, and there is a practical arrangement, and we have thought of that practical arrangement.
An illusion is spreading that there is no need for cooperation.
My farmer brother-in-law, who is talking about these political reasons, avoid it by kindness
In the law made in 2013, there is no law of consent in the schemes for which the government has sought land.
And that is why people are confused in the name of consent.
The agreement for the government was not even before, it is not even today.
And this is why my farmer brothers and sisters were very good before and we made bad, this is a very unfortunate attempt to mislead you.
I still say that for the private industry, for corporate, this "the law of cooperation" is in progress for private factories, yes.
And one thing I want to say, some say, PPP model
My farmer brother-in-law, assume a road worth 100 crores.
Is the road going to pick up an industrialist
Road remains the ownership of the government.
Land remains the ownership of the government.
The second maker is.
The maker is the second because the government does not have money today.
Because the government wants to become a school in the village, become a hospital in the village, read a poor child, it has money.
Private the road to make the road, but the private does not even make the road.
Do not take your home, the road makes the government.
In a way your capital seems to be.
This means that the project of the government will be in which the capital belongs to anyone, which people call the PPP model.
But if it is owned by the government, its ownership remains of the government, the government means you all, the hundred crore people of the country live, then in that we have said that there is no need for consent and that is why I need to clarify you about the illusions about the PPP model.
Occasionally, for the things we are saying that Bhai will emphasize "the process of cooperation" in a way to bureaucracy and dictatorship."
You tell me, there is a village, the road has become up to that village, now it is to build a road for another village, for the next village, it is 5 kilometers away.
The road has become up to this village, but the land of these villages is towards that village.
Tell me for the people of that village, to build the road, will these villages give land
"What will you agree"
So what is the crime behind the village, Bhai
Should he get a road or not, should you
In the same way I'm making a canal.
This village valo got water, became a canal.
But if the next village is to be transported, then the land falls between the villagers.
Then he will say that brother, we will not give the land.
We have got water.
So the next village should get a canal or not
My brother-in-law, this is a practical topic.
And therefore, for the work for which there is no such prolonged process, for the right and the farmer, it is not for the industry, it is not for business, for the good of the village, it is for the good of the farmer, for the good of his children. is.
Another thing is coming.
I have said this before.
In every house, the farmer wants a son to live in farming, but all the children go out to earn livelihood because he knows that today there is a demand for different efforts to run a house in the house.
If we build a road and the government ID beside the road
Endustrial orridor makes, not private.
I once again say, not private, capitalist, not Dhanna Seth, makes the government so that when the orridor becomes fifty kilometers long, 100 kilometers long, which will be built, one kilometer left of the road, one kilometer right there If the government makes the orridor so that the village which will come near 50 villages, 100 villages, 200 villages, they get somebody there, they get employment there, their children get employment.
Tell me, brothers and sisters, what do we want, children of our village farmers are forced to live in slum huts in Delhi and Mumbai
Should a small factory be found at a distance of 20-25 kilometers from their home and village and if they get employment, should not they get it
And this orridor is not private, this government will form.
By making the government, they will manage employment to the people of that area.
And that is why the ownership of the government, and who is for the good of the village, is for the good of the farmers of the village, who are for the good of the future generation of the farmers, who are for the good of the poor of the village. Those who are for them to make the farmers of the village electricity, there was a lot in this land acquisition bill for them, our authentic efforts are to overcome those shortcomings.
And yet I said in the Parliament that anyone still thinks there is a shortage, so we are ready to improve it.
When we kept in the Lok Sabha, some farmers leaders came and told two four things, we added.
We still say that brother land acquisition should be done only for the welfare of the farmers.
And this is our commitment, as many lies are spread, please, I urge my farmer brothers not to decide with the help of these lies, there is no need to be confused.
The need is how our farmer becomes powerful, how our village becomes powerful, how our farmer works, how to get the right money, how to get good markets, who creates good storage for maintenance, how to get the good of the village, work in the right direction for the good of the farmer.
My farmer brother-son, our efforts are to move forward in the country to increase your yield on your land, and that's why we have tried, like Soil Health Card, if man becomes sick then his health is tested in laboratory. .
As a person does not, it also happens to his mother-in-law, he also has his soil and mother.
And that's why we are not only worried about your land, but your land is also worried.
And therefore, land acquisition is not enough, your land becomes more powerful, this is our job too.
And that's why Soil has come with the talk of Dealth Card.
Every farmer is going to get the benefit, your fertilizer will be avoided.
Your crop will increase.
You get full money for the crop, there are good mandis for it, good law and order, not exploiting the farmer, we are working on it and you see my farmer brother, I remember, when I was Chief Minister in Gujarat I had done a lot of work in this direction.
In our Gujarat, the condition of the farmer was very bad, but worked on water, there was a big change.
The farmer's contribution to the development of Gujarat has become a big contribution which could never have thought.
The villages of the village were empty.
There has been a change, we want these changes in the whole country, due to which our farmer is happy.
And so my farmer brothers and sisters, today I got an opportunity to talk to you.
But due to the discussion of the Ordinance these days, I took a lot of time for him.
But my farmer brother-in-law, I will try, then once or twice I will talk to you again, and discuss the subjects, but I assure you that you have sent me by writing, I shake the whole government, I will put the government what is happening.
Good, you have told me a lot of things and I believe you have trust in me, then you haven't told me
I will not let this trust break, this I assure you.
Keep your love, remain your blessings.
And you are the world's fate, he never thinks of someone bad, he also does good to the country by harming himself.
This has been his tradition.
This government will worry about the loss of that farmer.
This I assure you but after listening to my mind today many ideas can come in your mind.
You must write me at the address of the AIR.
I'll talk further again.
Or on the basis of your letters, the mistakes that the government has to be correct will be corrected.
If there is a need to accelerate work, then I will accelerate and if someone is getting injustice, then I will make every effort to get justice.
Navaratri's holy festival is going on.
My best wishes to you.
.
