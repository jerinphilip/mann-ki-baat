Man Kee Bath, February 2019 (Mans says : 53 million) Namaskara of the natives.
My heart is hungry today when Man Kee Bath starts.
10 days ago, Mother India lost brave sons.
These adventurous heroes sacrificed themselves for the hundred and fifty Indians.
To sleep peacefully, our heroes kept waiting for the night.
After the martyrdom of the brave Jews in the terrible attack in Pulvama, the hearts of the people of the country are blown up, they shine.
The martyrs and their families are painful in everyone's mind.
Everyone knows the feeling of each of your minds against this horror.
There is this feeling in all the humanist groups of the world who believe in manifestation.
In order to preserve Bharatamba, I enjoy all the heroes in the country.
This martyrdom will inspire us to seize terror and strengthen our vision.
We have to face this challenge facing the nation, forgetting all the concepts like casteism, religiousism and localism.
Our actions against terror must be stronger, stronger, determined.
Our civilization and intellectual courage have been seen.
There's a miraculous ability to establish peace.
At the same time, the attackers have also responded to their own language.
You've seen how the attack took place within 100 hours.
The army is determined to seize the terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, they were able to see the reaction of their families encouraging through the medium, which enhances the whole country's enthusiasm.
The sentiments expressed by the father of Dhirajwan Ratan Takur of Bhagalpur in Bihar at this time of misery are inspiring to us.
He said he would send his second son to fight enemies, and if necessary, he would fight himself.
The martyrdom of Jagat Singhpur in Orissa, the son of Saheb, greeted the country of Minaji's brave courage.
It's been confirmed that the only son himself will join the CRPAF.
When Dhirajwan Vijay Shoren's grandson, who was lying in the Trivant Flag, reached the place named Gumla in Jharkhand, the young boy said he would join the army.
The emotion of this child today appears to be the manifestation of the catastrophe of the Indian land.
This is the same emotion that is seen in every house of our heroic, adventurous martyrs.
It's not different for one of our heroes.
Their family isn't different.
Although the martyr Vijaya Maurya of Deoria is concerned with the parents of Thilakraj in Kangra, the matter of the six-year-old son of Hemraj in Kota is full of inspiration in the family of the witnesses.
I want to tell the youth that the feelings of these families show their minds and understand them.
There is no need to go to ancient stories of history to understand what is patriotism, sacrifice and penance.
These are the live examples of our eyes.
This is inspired by the future of a bright India.
Dear people, we're all waiting for a war memorial in this long time since we've gained independence.
It's natural for people to be curiosity and excitement.
Mr. Omkar Shetty National War Island has been happy to finish from Karnataka's cart in the Nandermodi app.
I felt surprising and pain that there was no national warfare in India.
For the sake of the nation, there was a war memorial to form the royal tales of the heroes who sacrificed their lives.
I decided to have such a memorial.
I'm glad to decide to build a national war memorial and finish it in such a short time.
Tomorrow, i.e. on February 25, we will deliver millions of nationalists to this national military memorial.
The country will make a small effort to market.
This new monument is built in the heart of Delhi, i.e. India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I believe our people are going to this national military memorial to go to a pilgrimage.
National Military Memorial is a symbol of nation's gratitude for great martyrs after independence.
The design of the memorial shows the courage of our immortal soldiers.
National Military Memorial has been designed in three cattle.
It marks the journey from birth to martyrdom of every soldier.
The flame of the Amar Chakra is a symbol of the martyrdom of the soldier.
The second chakra shows the adventure and courage of the soldiers.
This is the gallery engraved by the bravery of soldiers in walls.
There's a trick after that.
This cattle shows the martyrdom of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the greatest martyrs for the country are recorded in the golden chambers.
And there's a rescue chakra, which shows safety.
In this cattle, the trees of dense trees can be seen.
These trees are symbols of soldiers.
People believe that soldiers are on the border in all the Yamas and the people of the country are safe.
The National Military Memorial is the place where people reach the great martyrs of the country to know and express their gratitude and try to know more about them.
Here is the story of self-sacrifice for the country, to live, to be safe, to develop the country.
In the development of the country, it is impossible to clarify the part of our armed forces, cops and armed forces with words.
Last year, in October, the National Police Memorial and I got the opportunity to surrender to the country.
It was also a reflection of thinking that men and women who were unrestrained for our security should be gratitude to the police.
I'm sure you'll come to see National Security Memorial and National Police Memorial.
Whenever you come, you must share pictures from there in social media.
It'll be inspired by others, this sacred place, they'll be glad to see these memorials.
Dear people, you have thousands of letters and opinions for Man Kee Ba and I'm getting through several media.
This time, I've seen a very remarkable opinion of Atish Mukhopadhyay.
It was about Birsa Munda.
When the British arrested Birsa Munda on March 3, 1900, he was only 25 years old.
Certainly the birthday of Jamshedji Tata on March 3.
The two personalities from the different families of Jharkhand's traditions and history have been enriched.
In a way the pride of Jharkhand's pride and traditional history is to be offered to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata through Man Keeba.
I agree with Atis ji.
These two great monks have enhanced the entire nation, not just Jharkhand.
People are gratitude in their contribution to the whole country.
It's Birsa Munda if our youth want to be inspired today.
The Englishman had arrested him when he was sleeping very specially.
Do you know why the English had sustained such a terrible way
Because even the Englishmen who built such a big empire were afraid of him.
Mr.
Birsa uma was captured by the British rule that used guns and cannons using their traditional ancestors and wildlife.
Anyway, it is clear that when people get an inspiring personality, the power of weapons gains the social will of the people.
Mr.
Birsa Maa fought not only for rational freedom to the British, but also for the social and economic freedom of the tribals.
He did this in his short life.
He spreads the light like the sun in the dark life of those who disobeyed and deceived.
He committed suicide at the age of 25.
The heroes of Bharatamba, like Birsa Munda, are all over the country.
There will be no kingdom and Bharatbhoo without participating in the centuries of this freedom struggle.
But the stories of their sacrifice, humility and self-reliance did not reach the new generation.
Mr.
If the personality of Birsa Munda makes us aware of our existence then the personality like Jamshedji Tata has given the country a big institution.
Jamshedji Tatta was a long-sighted man in the right meaning.
He did not only dream of the future of India, but also gave a strong fight.
He knew that India needed scientific tricks and it should be a commercial center.
Today, the Science of Tata Institute, called the Indian Institute of Science, was established as a result of his long vision.
Not only this, he established global level institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekananda are seen in the ship during their journey to America.
Then the main point of discussion between the two was what could be done to ensure the spread and spread of science and technology in India.
It is said that this discussion has become possible to establish the Science of the Indian Institute.
Dear people, Mr. Prime Minister of our country.
Morarjibhai Desai was born in February 29.
As you know, this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai, the owner of the calm personality, was one of the most promising leaders of the country.
Morarjibai has the luck for the budget to be presented most often in the freedom struggle.
Morarji gave India a good leadership in the country at a difficult time in the trouble of the country's democracy.
Our next generation is bound to him in its name.
Morarjibhai became a part of the nation's commitment to protect democracy against emergency.
He had to pay a price in the name of this.
The government arrested him and put him in jail.
But when he won the Janta Party elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his reign, 44th rule was altered.
It's great.
Because at the time of emergency, the 42th rule was brought to recover.
Through this, the Department of Adolescence has been undertaken to reduce the power of Adolescence and prevent other democracies.
The 44th Broadcast has been the law to publicize the proceedings of the Parliament and the Parliament.
Some of the Supreme Court's powers were restructured through this.
The maulik rule, which was received by 20, 21 of the Constitution, did not repeal even during the period of emergency.
If the ministry asks, the President should declare an emergency and the period of emergency cannot be passed once more than six months.
In 1975, Morarjibai ensured that he did not repeat democracy in the future.
His great contribution to maintain the greatness of the Indian democracy will be reminded of the generation.
Once again, the great leader is honored.
Dear people, like every year, this time there is enthusiasm among the people about the rituals.
Now we're making a new burden.
On this occasion, he wished to honor those who performed his work on the ground.
They bring positive changes in the lives of others in different ways of self-consciousness.
They're all living in the nation's civilization and social security.
People ask who's when they declare the rituals, they'll be caught in your attention.
In a way, I see it a great achievement.
Because they don't have a message in TV or magazines or papers.
They stay away from the busy public life, but they are keen to work among the common people without thinking about their own names.
Those who follow the Gita mission of Yoga and Karmasu Kaushal in their own life.
Some people like to fly to you.
You must have heard about Orissa's darling dog.
Canal Man of the Disha isn't a hate.
The devil's dog cut the mountain with his hands in his village at a distance of three kilometres.
The water conservation was finished by its own effort, and the problem of water was over.
Let's take the matter of Abdullah Gafur Khatriji in Gujarat.
He was surprised to revive the traditional illness of Kach.
It's a great deal to bring a rare painting to the new floor.
The art of the trio of life made by Abdul Gaffur, I gave to the former President of America for Barak's reference.
Among those who received Padma Puruskar, Shabbir Said of Marathwada is known as Gomata's servant.
It's different for him to serve Gomata.
Madurai Chinna tried to empower the victims and the Christians through the Kalanjiam Sammir in Tamilnadu.
If you hear about Tao Porchon-ynch in America, you'll be surprised to cheer up.
Linch is now a big institution for yoga.
They're giving yoga training to people around the world at the age of 100.
In this, 1500 people have been trained.
Yamuna Tudu, famous by the name of Lady Tarson in Jharkhand, worked as an adventure to fight mafia and naksals.
Not only 50 hectares of jungles are waiting to destroy, but they inspire ten thousand women to work for the protection of trees and wildlife.
Today, when a villager is born, 18 trees and 10 trees are grown when the girl is born.
The story of Muktabane Partjakumar Dagli in Gujarat will be very inspiration for you.
Though Divya is herself, she doesn't have any similarities for the progress of divine women.
In the beginning of the institute by the name of Chakshu Mahila Seva Kunj, they worship the invisible children for self-confidence.
The story of Rajkumari Devi, who is known as Kisan Chachi of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, is very inspired.
They show different examples of women's hygiene and farming.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women in that area to be self-sufficient and financially self-reliant.
They trained the village women with other jobs.
It's impossible that they tried to connect technology with agriculture.
Beloved people, it is the most important that 12 of those who have given the priests this year are farmers.
Ordinarily, a few people associated with the farm sector have come to the list of Pathmashree, who are directly cultivating.
The present change is a living picture of India.
Dear people, today I'm going to tell you something hysterical.
I've got it for the last few days.
Wherever I go to the country, I try to see the beneficiaries of the Prime Minister's Public Health Plan, part of the Ayushman India Plan.
I got a chance to talk to somebody.
In some places, a mother was unhappy with money to provide treatment to her little child.
According to this plan, the child got treatment, he got health back.
Grandfather, who was slaughtered and worked, was unable to work at risk.
With this plan, he benefited and healthy and started leading a new life.
Brother brothers, about twelve lakh poor families got the benefit of this scheme in the last five months.
I saw how big it brings in poor life.
If you don't know anybody's neglected to treat them without money, tell them about this plan.
This plan is for such poor people.
Dear people are going to start exams at school.
In the next few weeks, different education board exams, tenth class and twelveth classes will begin.
All the students who are going to write the exam, their guardians and all the teachers have heart-breaking good hopes.
A few days ago, in Delhi, there was a big program called Exam Paper Church.
In this town hall, I have been able to talk to millions of students and parents from abroad and teachers with the help of technology.
The distinction of this program called Exam Pay Church is to openly discuss many things related to the exam.
Of course, students talk about things that are useful.
All students and their teachers and parents will see video of this program in the tube.
Good luck for all exam fighters in the coming exams.
Dear people, how don't you talk about festivals when you talk about India...
That's not possible.
There's no day in our country without any kind of importance.
Because we have the tradition of thousands of ancient culture.
The festival of Mahashivaratri is coming in a few days.
This time Shivaratri is Monday.
If Shivaratri is on Monday, its special importance will come to us.
My very good luck for you in the grace of this Shivratri.
Dear people, I went to Kashi a few days ago.
There I got the chance to live with the divine brothers.
The visit was inspiring and inspiration.
He said he was a stage artisan to talk to a prophet in the middle of the conversation.
When I said Mimikri is present in the stage, I asked who would follow.
Then he says he follows the Prime Minister.
I told you to see it.
I was very surprised.
I played the same thing in Man Keeba.
Man Kee Bath was permitted.
I'm very happy that people hear Man Kee Bath and remember it in many occasions.
My favour of the divine young man.
Dear people, you're connected to Man Kee Bath's program, I have a very good experience.
I'm talking about millions of families in a way through radio every month.
I think you're part of my family when you read your letters when you talk to you.
It gives me a very comfortable experience.
Friends, the election is the biggest festival of democracy.
Next two months, everybody will be in a hurry for the election.
I'm going to be in this election.
Considering the healthy democracy tradition, the next Man Ki Bath will be the last Sunday of May.
I mean, after the elections in March, April and May months, I can tell you again through Man Kee Ba on the strength of your blessings with new faith.
I've been telling you Man Kee Bath for years.
Once again, you'll be gratitude for them.
