Talking about the mind, July 2017, my dear countrymen, greetings.
Man's mind is such that rainy season is a very pleasant time for the mind.
Animals, birds, plants, natures everybody gets thrilled on the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a vivid form, then it is known how big it is to destroy water.
Nature gives us life, raises us, but sometimes natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, its gruesome form, destroys very much.
The change in changing weather cycle and environment is also getting bigger nagativ impact.
For the past few days, some parts of Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bengal have suffered natural calamities due to over-year.
Flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Relief work is being done at a broader level.
Wherever possible, my colleagues of the Council of Ministers are also reaching there.
State Governments are also making every effort to help flood victims in their own way.
Social organizations, cultural organizations, civilians working with service, are also making every effort to help people in such a situation.
From the Government of India, the soldiers of the army, the people of the Air Force, the people of the NCR, the paramilitary Forces, everybody is associated with the lives of the disaster victims at such times.
The flood becomes quite disrupted by the people.
Crops, livestock, intrastructure, roads, electricity, communication links all get affected.
Especially our farmers' brothers, crops, crops, which are damaged by the fields, these days, we have planned to protect crop insurance companies especially to crop insurance companies so that the farmers can be cleanetlement immediately.
And 247 control room helpline number 1078 is constantly working to deal with the flood situation.
People also tell their difficulties.
The entire government machinery was prepared by mocking the maximum places before the rainy season.
NCR teams were set up.
Making disaster-friends at places and training disaster-friend dos-donts, deciding volunteers, creating a public organization-working in such a situation.
These days, the forecast of the weather, now the texchanology has gone so far, the space science has also been a big role, due to which the nearest estimates are correct.
Gradually, we also made the nature that according to the forecast of the weather, we can also create our activities, then we can avoid harm.
Whenever I prepare for "mind", I see, citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time there have been so many letters about GST, so many phone calls have come and people still express happiness about GST, also express curiosity.
A phone call I also tell you: "Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking Neetu Garg from Gurgaon."
I heard your hearted accountants Day's speech and was very impressed.
Similarly, on the date of our country last month, Goods and Services Tax-GST started.
Can you tell that as the government had epected, the results are coming a month later or not
I would like to hear your thoughts about it, thank you.
GST has been implemented for nearly a month and its benefits have started to appear.
And I am very satisfactory, I am happy, when someone writes a letter to me and says that due to GST, how the prices have been reduced in a poor need, how things have become cheap.
If North-Ast, in far-flung mountains, a person living in the forest writes a letter that initially feared that I did not know what
But now when I started learning and understanding it, I think it's easier than ever before.
Trade became easier.
And the biggest thing is, customers have started growing trust in the businessman.
Right now I was seeing how GST had an image on transport and logistics sector.
How the movement of trucks has increased now
How is the time decreasing distance
Chighways clutter ree.
Pollution has also decreased due to the speed of trucks.
The goods are also reaching very quickly.
This facility is only, but at the same time economic speed also gets strength from it.
Due to the first separate ta structure, the maximum resources of the transport and logistics sector was used to make paperwork and it had to make new warehouses inside every state.
GST , which I call God and Simple Ta, really has created a very positive effect on our economy and very little time.
The rapid smooth transmission has occurred, the speed that has migrated, new registrations have been created, it has created a new belief throughout the country.
And sometimes the pundits of the economy, the pundits of the management, the pundits of Technologi, India's use of GST will definitely write a resolution in front of the world.
There will be a case studi for many universities in the world.
Because on such a large scale, it is a huge height of success in itself and to implement it in such a huge country with the involution of so many millions of people.
The world will definitely study it.
And GST has been implemented, all states have a partnership in it, it is also responsible for all the states.
All the decisions have been made by the states and the Center unanimously.
And the result of that is that every government has the same priority that due to GST, there is no burden on the poor plate.
And at the GST app, you can well know how much the price was before GST, how much will it cost in the new situation, the whole is available on your mobile phone.
ne Nation ne Ta, how big a dream was completed.
I have seen the issue of GST in the manner in which the government officials sitting from Tehsil to the Government of India have worked with a dedication, in a way that Rindly Environment made between the government and the traders, between the government and the customers, he played a big role in enhancing confidence.
I congratulate all the ministries engaged in this work, all the departments, all the members of the Central and State Government, very much.
GST is an excellent example of India's collective power success.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a reform, an economy that strengthens the culture of a new honesty.
There is also a campaign of social reform in a way.
Once again, I simplicate the countrymen to make such a big effort simple.
My dear countrymen, the month of the August Month Revolution.
We have easily heard this thing since childhood and the reason for this is, August 1, 1920 " Non-cooperation Movement" started.
August 9, 1942 uit India Movement started, which is known as "Augast Revolution" and the country was freed on August 15, 1947.
In a way, many incidents in the month of August are specially associated with Azad's Tawarikh.
This year we uit India
Ondia Movement is going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of this movement.
But very few people know that "uit India" this slogan was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, who continued to struggle with the freedom of freedom, continued to struggle, the pages of history are our inspiration for the creation of a grand India.
Our freedom fighters have sacrificed, penance, sacrificed, what can be great inspiration from it.
Leave India Movement was an important struggle for the Indian Independence Movement.
This movement had resolved the whole country to liberate from the British-Raj.
This was the time when the Indian public in protest of British power, in every corner of Hindustan, village, city, read, illiterate, poor, rich, everybody mixed shoulder and shoulder quit India And became part of the movement.
People's attraction was on their peak.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were fighting their lives with the mantra of Karo or Maro.
Millions of young people of the country had left their studies, left the books.
Freedom of freedom, they were running.
On August 9, uit India Movement Mahatma Gandhi called upon, but all the big leaders, English Sultanate, put everyone in jail and it was a period that Leadership of Second Generation in the country, Dr. Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan had played an advance role.
"The non-cooperation movement and uit India Movement 1920 and 1942, two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi are visible."
"The forms of non-cooperation were different and the situation of 42 came, the intensity increased so much that the great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of Karo or Maro."
There was mass support behind all this success, there was public power, public resources, mass struggle.
The whole country was fighting one by one.
And I sometimes think, if you look at the pages of history, then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1857.
The freedom struggle started from 1857 till 1942, every moment continued in some corner of the country.
This long period created a flame of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone was committed to something.
The generation changed, but there was no shortage of resolution.
People came, joined, went, new came, added new and the country continued to try every moment to overthrow the British Sultanate.
This hard work from 1857 to 1942, this movement created such a situation that 1942 reached its peak and uit India was such a buzz that within 5 years the British had to go in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, the flame of independence reached the masses.
And from 1942 to 1947, five years, became such a mass mind, the determination became the cause of freedom to the country with success in the form of five decisive years of success.
These were five years of decisive years.
Now I want to add you to this math.
We were freed in 1947.
Today is 2017.
It's almost 70 years.
Governments came
Arrangements made, changed, flourished, increased.
Everyone has made efforts in their own way to free the country from problems.
To increase employment in the country, to remove poverty, efforts have been made to develop.
There was also hard work in their own way.
Successes also got.
The expectations also awakened.
Like 1942 to 1947, there was a decisive five years of Siddhi from resolution.
I am seeing that from 2017 to 2022 resolution, and a five-year section has come to us.
On August 15, 2017, we celebrated as a resolution festival and in 2022, when independence will be 75 years, then we will continue to convert that resolution into perfection.
If on August 9, after remembering the Revolution Day, every Indian will make a resolution on August 15, as a person, "I will do so for the country, as a family, I will do it as a society, I will do it as a village and a city, it will do it as a government department, as a government.
There are crores of resolutions.
Efforts to fulfill millions of resolutions.
So, as 1942 to 1947 became decisive for five years of independence, they can become decisive for the future of India from five years 2017 to 2022.
Five years later, the country will celebrate 75 years of independence.
Then we all have to take a firm resolution today.
2017 is to make the year of our resolution.
This is what we have to join with August month resolution and we have to resolve.
uit India, poverty Leave India, corruption uit India, uit terrorism India, casteism uit India, uit communalism leave India.
Today, not the need to do or die, but to join with the resolution of the new India, it is to mobilize, to do the right to achieve success by life.
There is a living about the resolution, struggle.
Let's run a Mahabhiyan of Siddhi from 9th August in August this month.
Each Indian, social institutions, local bodies units, schools, colleges, different organizations every one New VIDEO
Take some resolution for Endia.
A resolution, which we will prove in the next 5 years.
Young organization, student organization, NGO etc. can organize collective discussions.
New-new ideas can be exposed.
Where do we reach as a nation
What can I contribute in a person
Come, we join the festival of this resolution.
I'm specially Wonline World today, because we're somewhere or not, but Conlines are definitely
The World of Conline and especially my young colleagues, invite my young friends, that they come forward to contribute innovative ways in the creation of a new India.
Video, post, blog, article, new idea using texchnology, they come with all the things.
Transform this campaign into a mass movement.
uit UI for young friends also on NarendraModiApp
ndia ui launch will be.
It is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe you must propagate it, spread it.
My dear countrymen, on August 15, as the country's chief servant, I get an opportunity to communicate with the country with the Red City.
I'm a sweetheart.
There he does not speak a person.
The voice of hundreds of millions of people from the Red City resonates.
Trying to word their dreams and I am happy that for the last 3 years, I get suggestions from every corner of the country, which I should say on August 15
What issues should be taken
This time too I invite you.
You must send me your thoughts either on myGov or on NarendramodiApp.
I read it myself and I will try to introduce it in whatever time I have on August 15.
In the last 3 times, I have received a complaint in my 15th August speeches that my speech becomes a little longer.
This time I have imagined that I should shorten it.
Complete it in maximum 40-45-50 minutes.
I have tried to make rules for me
Don't know, I can't do that.
But I intend to try this time how to shorten my speech
See, it does not get success.
I want to do another thing today, the countrymen.
There is a social economics in India's economy.
And we should never come down to him.
Our festival, our festival, that is just the occasion of joy-pramod, it is not so.
Our festival, our festival is also a campaign of social reform.
But along with him, we have a direct relationship with every festival, poor and poor economic life.
After a few days, Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, after that Ganesh Utsav, after that fourth Chandra, then Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Diwali, one-by-one, and this is the time when for poor, opportunities for economic abortions are available.
And in these festivals, a natural joy is also added.
Festivals bring sweetness in relationships, affection in family, brotherhood in society.
Add people and society.
A simple journey from the person to the summit runs.
"Ahm becomes an opportunity to go towards the future."
As far as the economy is concerned, many months before Rakhi, hundreds of families start making rakhiya in small domestic industries.
From Khadi to silk threads, do not know how many types of ashes and nowadays people like homemade ashes more.
The business of Rakhi makers, Rakhiya sellers, thousands of sweets is added to a festival.
Our poor siblings, families go through this.
We burn the lamp in Deepawali, it is only light and festival, it is not just a festival, it is not so.
His direct relationship is with those poor families who make small soil.
But when I talk about the poor economy associated with festivals and festivals today, I would also like to talk about the environment.
I have seen that sometimes I think the countrymen are more aware of me, more active.
For the last one month, consistent citizens have written me letters to the environment.
And he has urged you to tell Ganesh Chaturthi about the eco-friendly Ganesh before time, so that people have planned on the choice of Ganesh of soil.
I am grateful to such aware citizens first.
They have urged me to say on this subject before time.
This time public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
Lokmanya Tilak ji started this great tradition.
This year is 125th year of public Ganeshotsav.
Hundreds of years and hundreds of millions of countrymen Lokmanya Tilak ji started public Ganeshotsav for collective rituals for the unity and awareness of society.
We once again compete essays in this year of Ganeshotsav, make discussion meetings, remember the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak.
And again, the spirit of Tilak ji, how can we take the public Ganeshotsav in that direction
How to strengthen that feeling again and as well as to protect the environment, Ganesh, made of soil, it is our resolve.
And this time I ' ve said very early
I am sure you will all join me and benefit from this that our poor artisans, poor artists who make idols, they will get employment, fill the poor stomach.
Come, let us connect our festivals with poor, connect with the poor economy, enjoy our festival becomes an economic festival of poor house, become economic joy, all of us should be our endeavor.
I give a lot of good wishes to all the countrymen for many festivals, festivals, festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that education should be an area, economic area, social sector, sports are: Our daughters are illuminating the name of the country, getting new heights.
We are proud of our daughters, we are getting delicate.
In the past, our daughters performed gloriously in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those players this week.
I felt very good by talking to them, but I was feeling that the World Cup could not win, it had a big burden on them.
He had pressure on his face too, there was tension.
I told those daughters and I gave me a different evaluation.
I said Look, nowadays the amount of media is such that the expectations are increased so much, and when the success is not available, then it also turns into resentment.
We have seen many such games that if India's players fail, then the country's anger breaks on those players.
Some people break the limits and say something like this, write such things, there is a great pain.
But for the first time that when our daughters could not succeed in the World Cup, the hundred and fifty million people took that defeat on their shoulders.
Not only did the burden not let those daughters fall on, but they praised what these daughters did, praised them.
I see it a pleasant change and I told these daughters that you see, such a good fortune only you have got people.
You get out of your mind that you have not succeeded.
Whether you win or won the match, you have won hundreds of millions of countrymen.
Indeed, our young generation of our country, our daughters of Khaskar are really doing a lot to illuminate the name of the country.
I once again congratulate the younger generation of the country, especially our daughters of the heart.
Give me good wishes.
My dear countrymen, then recall the August Revolution, then recall once on August 9, then recall once on August 15, recall once again, 2022, 75 years of independence.
Every countryman should make a resolution, prepare a 5-year-old road-map to prove every countryman's resolution.
We all have to reach the country on new heights, reach and reach.
Come on, let's go, let's do something.
The fate of the country, the future will be best, move forward with this belief.
Good luck.
Thank you.
