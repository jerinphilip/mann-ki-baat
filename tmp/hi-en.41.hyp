Talking to the mind, September 2015, my dear countrymen, greet you all
"This is the twelfth episode of the mind and accordingly, one year has passed.
Last year, on October 3, I had the privilege to talk about "Man" for the first time.
"The talk of mind - one year, many things.
I don't know what you found, but I can say so much, I found a lot.
There is immense importance of public power in democracy.
There is a fundamental thinking in my life and due to this I have immense faith in the people's power.
But "the thing of the mind taught me, what I explained, what I have experienced, I can say that we think, more people's power is alternate."
Our ancestors used to say that people and people, this is the part of God.
I can say to my experiences of "mind" that there is a great power in the thinking of our ancestors, because I have experienced this.
"I used to ask people for suggestions and perhaps only two or four suggestions could be handled every time."
But in the number of millions people used to give me suggestions by becoming active.
This is a huge power in itself, or gave a message to the Prime Minister, wrote on mygov.in, sent a letter, but once we did not get our chance, then any person could be disappointed.
But I did not like that.
Yes, these millions of letters taught me a very big lesson.
I have been getting information about many minute difficulties of the government and I also congratulate the AIR that they did not consider these suggestions as just one paper, considered the aspiration of a common man.
They did the program after this.
Different departments of the government were called in Akashwani and kept in front of what the people and Janardhan had said.
Attempted to solve some things.
Our different departments of the government, have done these letters in people and what are the things that are political matters
What are those things that are trouble due to person
What are those things that are not in the eyes of the government
Many things started coming to the government from Grass-root level and it is true that the basic principle of government is that information should go from the bottom to the top and guidance should go from top to bottom.
The source of these information will become a matter of mind, where did anyone think
But it happened.
And in the same way, "Man's talk made an opportunity for expression of society-power."
I had said one day that Selfie with Dotter (selie w.
The daughter and the whole world became surprised, perhaps somebody from all countries of the world has millions of selfie with dotters.
The daughter and the daughter got dignity.
And when she's selfie with Dotter.
The daughter used to enjoy his daughter, but he used to create a commitment within himself.
When people saw, they also felt that the apathy towards daughters would now have to be left.
Silent was revolution.
Keeping in mind India's tourism, I had told such citizens, I
Encredible ID
Andia, that brother, you also go, whoever has a good picture, then I'll see.
The same thing was lightly talked, but what was great
In the number of millions, people sent such pictures of every corner of India.
Perhaps the tourism of the Government of India, the state government's tourism department will never have thought that we have such heritage.
All things came on a platform and a rupee of the government was not spent.
People increased the work.
I am happy that I had mentioned Gandhi Jayanti before the first month of October last, and people had prayed that we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2.
There was a time, Khadi for nation. Is not the time for Khadi for Fashion - and people I had requested you to buy Khadi.
Just do a little bit.
Today, I say with great satisfaction that about the sale of Khadi has doubled in the last one year.
Now it has not happened with any government advertisingment.
It has not been spent by spending billions of rupees.
A feeling of public power, a feeling.
Once I said in the matter of "Man", the stove burns in the poor's house, the children keep crying, the poor mother - Shouldn't she get gas cylinder
And I prayed to the rich people that you can't subsidy surrender
Think. And I want to say with great pleasure today that three million families of this country have left the subsidy of Gas Cylinder - and they are not rich people.
On a TV channel I had seen that a retired teacher, widow woman, she was standing in the queue to leave subsidy.
Even the general public of the society, middle class, lower middle class, for which it is difficult to leave subsidy.
But such people left.
Isn't this Silent Revolution
Is not these people's power
Governments will also have to learn a lesson that after the intersection of our government chaukhata, there is a powerful, energetic and determined society of a very big manpower.
The more the governments run by joining the society, the more society can work as a good catalactic agent for change.
"In the matter of mind, I had all my trust, but today he turned back into faith, reversed in reverence and so today through the talk of mind, once again I want to stop the power of the people, I want to bow down. "
Every small thing made its own and tried to connect itself to the good of the country.
What can be greater satisfaction than this
"In the matter of mind this time I thought to do a new experiment.
I had prayed to the citizens of the country that you should write your questions, your suggestions, I will pay attention to him in the matter of "mind".
I'm glad that there have been more than a thousand thousand phone calls from the country.
Whether Siachen, whether it is Kutch or Kamrup, whether Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There will be no land in India from where people have not done phone calls.
This is a pleasant experience in itself.
People of all ages have given messages.
Some senses I liked to hear myself, I liked it.
My team is working on the rest.
You may have put a minute-two minutes, but your phone call for me, your message is very important.
The whole government will definitely work on your suggestions.
But one thing was surprised and enjoyed for me.
Well, it looks like there is negativeity around, negative.
But my experience was different.
These fifty thousand people had to tell their way.
There was unrestrained, could say anything, but I am surprised, all things were like "Mann's thing" in the shadow of the shadow."
Completely positive, suggestive, creative - i.e. the common citizen of the country is also taking positive thinking, how big it is the country's capital.
Perhaps there may be 1, 2 such phones in which there is an atmosphere of serious kind of complaint.
Otherwise, more than 90 people have said an energy filling, enjoying things.
In one thing and meditation, especially specially ableed - in that too, the visually visually visually have come to his own, a lot of phones.
But the reason for this would be, perhaps they can't see the TV, they must hear the radio.
How important the radio will be for visually impaired, it has come to me from this point of view.
I am looking at a new aspect, and have told such good things that these people and the government are too sensitive to making them sensitive.
I have given a message from Alwar, Rajasthan, Pawan Acharya, I believe, the whole country should listen to Pawan Acharya and the whole country should accept it.
Look, what they want to say, listen "My name is Pawan Acharya and I bill from Alwar, Rajasthan."
My message is to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, please call the people of the whole country this time in the matter of "mind" that they use more and more soil conditions on Diwali."
This will benefit the environment and thousands of potter brothers will get employment opportunities.
Thank you.
Pawan, I believe that like Pawan, your feeling will reach every corner of India, it will spread.
Good suggestions have been given and soil does not have any value, and therefore the soil is also priceless.
It also has an important significance from the point of view of the environment and it is made in the poor's house, small people fill their stomach with this work and I definitely tell the countrymen that if we believe in the coming festivals, then it means that the light will burn in our house, but the light will be in the poor house.
On the day of my dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi, I got an opportunity to spend two to three hours with the army personnel.
Our water army that protects water, land and rivers, the army or the air force, the war of Army, Air Force, Navy, 1965, completed 50 years with Pakistan, under which India Gate has created a "Shauryanjali Exhibition" in Delhi.
I kept watching him with the key, went for half an hour, but when it came out, it took two and a half hours and still remained incomplete.
Wasn't something there
The whole history has been kept alive.
Look at Aesthetic vision, it is also best, look at history, then it is a big educator and look for inspiration in life, perhaps there can be no greater inspiration than this to serve the motherland.
We all used to listen to the proud moments of war and the indomitable courage and sacrifice of our fighters, at that time there was not so much photograph, so much videography was also not there.
Through this exhibition, he feels.
If the fight is of Hajipir, the real answer, the battle of Chaminda and the scenes of Hajipir pass, then it is exciting and proud of its army jawans.
I also met these brave families, those sacrifice families and those who participated in the war are now in the north era of life.
They also reached.
And when they were joining hands, it seemed that wow, what is energy, gave an inspiration.
If you want to make history, then it is necessary to know the nuances of history.
History connects us with our roots.
If the relationship goes away from history, then the possibilities of making history also take full cease.
Through this bravery exhibition, history is experienced.
History is known.
And seeds of inspiration to create new history can also be sown.
I want you, your family members - if you are around Delhi - maybe the exhibition is going to last a few days, you must see.
And don't hasty like me.
I came back in two-and-a-half hours, but you will definitely take three-four hours.
Look at it.
See the strength of democracy, a small child has ordered the Prime Minister, but the child has forgotten to tell his name in haste.
So I do not have his name, but his point is like considering the Prime Minister, but we are like looking at all the people.
Listen, what this child is saying to us: "Prime Minister Modi ji, I want to tell you that for the cleanliness campaign you have run, you need dustbin everywhere, every street.
This boy has said right.
We should also create cleanliness and make arrangements for cleanliness.
I got a great satisfaction from the message of this child.
Santosh got this, on October 2, I announced to run a campaign against Swachh Bharat, and I can say, perhaps for the first time after independence, it would have happened that in Parliament for hours, the issue of cleanliness is discussed nowadays.
Our government is also criticized.
I also have to hear a lot, that Modi used to talk big things, cleanliness, but what happened
I don't think it's bad.
I am looking at the goodness of this that the country's Parliament is also discussing for cleanliness of India.
And look at the other side, on one hand Parliament and on one hand both the infants of this country - talk about cleanliness, what can be the good fortune of the bigger country.
This movement is going on, the atmosphere of hatred towards dirt, there has been an awareness towards cleanliness - it will force the governments to work, will do it,
Local Swaraj's institutions too - whether Panchayat, Nagar Panchayat, Municipality, Municipal Corporation or State or Center - Everyone will have to work on this.
We have to move forward this movement, despite the shortcomings, and this India will be celebrated in 2019 when we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's 150th Jayanti, we work towards fulfilling Mahatma Gandhi's dreams.
And you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Once he has said that I have to like one of both freedom and cleanliness, then I will like cleanliness first, independence later.
Gandhi had the importance of cleanliness more than independence.
Let us all believe in the matter of Mahatma Gandhi and we also move some steps to fulfill his wish.
Gulshan Arora ji from Delhi has left a message on MyGov.
He has written that he wants to know about Deendayal ji's birth centenary.
My dear countrymen, the life of great men is always the cause of inspiration for us.
And it is not our job to evaluate the work of the people, the great man who was of the ideology.
Everyone who lives and dies for the country is inspiration for us.
And in these days, there is an opportunity to remember so many great men, on September 25, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri on October 2, Jaiprakash Narayan ji on October 11, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel - How many countless names I am speaking, because this country is a multicolor Vasundhara.
You remove any date, the name of any great man will be found from the history of history.
In the coming days, remember all these great men, send us the message of their life to the house and we also try to learn something from them.
I specially want to urge once again for October 2.
On October 2, Pooja Bapu is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
I had also said last year that you will have clothes of every kind, every kind of abric, there will be many things, but there should also be a khadi place in it.
I once again say that there is concession in Khadi from October 2 to one month, take advantage of it.
And along with Khadi, handloom should be given equal importance.
Our weavers brothers do so, we will go to the house of poor weavers.
Khadi will go to the poor widow's house.
And so in this Diwali, we must give Khadi a place in our house, place your body.
I don ' t ever urge you to be completely khadidhari
Just, that's all I urge.
And look, the last time the sale was very close.
How many poor people have benefited.
The government can not do the work with billions of rupees, you have done it with small help.
This is the manpower.
And so I once again urge you to do that.
Dear countrymen, my mind is very happy with one thing.
Minds, you should also get a little taste of this joy.
I went to Kolkata in May and came to meet Subhash Bose's family members.
His nephew Chandra Bose did all organie.
For a long time, I had the opportunity to spend the evening of laughing with Subhash Babu's family members.
And on that day it was decided that Subhash Babu's elderly family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
Chandra Bose and his family were engaged in this work and last week I got conformation that more than 50 Subhash Babu's family members are going to be at the Prime Minister's residence.
You can imagine, how big will you be for me
Netaji's family, perhaps for the first time in his life, there must have been an opportunity to go to the Prime Minister's residence together.
But more than that, it is a matter of great pleasure for me that the good luck of such guests in the Prime Minister's residence has never come, which is going to meet me in October.
More than 50 of Subhash Babu - and people from all family live in different countries - all people are coming special.
How big will be the moment of happiness for me
I'm very happy to welcome them, feeling very happy.
A message I met on behalf of Bhargavi Kanda and his way of speaking, his voice, listening to all this, I felt that he also seems to be a leader and maybe it would be a leader, it seems.
"My name is Bhargavi Kanda."
I want to request the Prime Minister that you awaken the younger generation about the voters registration, which will increase the participation of the younger generation in the coming time and the important support of the younger generation in the future is to choose and run. Could also happen.
Thank you.
Bhargavi has said that talking about the name register in the voter list and voting.
Your point is right.
Every voter in democracy is the fate of the country and this awareness is gradually increasing.
Polling percentage is also increasing.
And I want to specially congratulate the Election Commission of India for this.
A few years ago we saw our Election Commission is working as a regulator only.
But for the last few years there has been a big change in it.
Today our Election Commission has not been just regulatory, has become aclilitary in a way, has become a voter-friendly and all his thinking, voters live in his center in all the schemes.
This has changed very good.
But only the Election Commission has been working, it is not going to run.
We should also keep an atmosphere of awakening in school, in college, in the neighborhood - only elections come, then be awakening, not so.
Voters should be upgraded, we should also keep watching.
The invaluable right I have got is my right or not, I am using the right that I am not doing, this habit should make us all.
I hope, if the youth of the country have not registered in the voter list, then they should be and vote should also be done.
And I say publicly in the days of elections that first voting, then fountain.
So sacred work, everyone should do it.
But I came to visit Kashi.
Meet many people, there were many programs.
Meet so many people, but two boys, whom I want to talk to you.
One got me a student of class 7 by horizon Pandey.
He reads in the 7th grade at the Central School at Banaras Hindu University.
Well big flamboyant.
His confinence level is also very worst
But at such a young age I saw his interest in the research of Physics.
I thought he would read a lot, internet suring, see new experiments, how to stop rail accidents, which texchanology, how to reduce costs in energy, how to sell in Robots, and not know what was telling
It was very worst, brother
Well, I did not closely see how close it is in what he is saying, but his confinence level, his interest, and I want that the children of our country should be interested in science.
There should be constant questions in the mind of the child - why
How
When
These child minds should be asked.
In the same way, I got to meet Sonam Patel, a very small girl.
It is 9 years old.
She is a daughter of Sadavrat Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi, daughter of a very poor family.
And I was surprised that the girl, the whole Gita is stiff.
But the biggest thing I felt that when I asked him, he used to tell the sloka, interpretation in English, used to define it, used to define it in Hindi.
I asked his father, then said, he is speaking from the age of five.
I said, where did you learn
Speak, we do not even know.
So I said, and what is in studies, only the Gita keeps reading and does anything
So he said, no, if he takes Mathematics once, then in the evening he has all the mouthpieces.
Take Vistory, remember everything in the evening.
Speak, we are also surprised for the people, in the whole family how it is inside.
I was really very impressed.
Sometimes some children get fond of Celebrity, there was nothing like that in Sonam.
God has given some power in myself, I felt like that.
Well these two kids, there was a special meeting in my Kashi Yatra.
So I thought I could tell you too.
We do a lot of work except what you see on TV, read in newspapers.
And sometimes there is some joy of such things.
The same, with these two boys, my conversation was memorable for me.
I have seen that in the matter of "mind some people come with a lot of work" for me.
See what Sandeep of Haryana is saying "Sandeep, Haryana"
Sir, I want you to talk about "mind" once in a month, you should vically, because you get a lot of inspiration from your point of view.
Sandeep ji, what will you do to me
I also have to make such a hard work once a month, so much adjust of time.
Sometimes all our companions of our galaxy have to sit and wait half an hour and a half an hour.
But I respect your feeling.
I am grateful to you for your suggestion.
Right now one month is fine.
"The matter of mind is completed in a way of one year."
You know how much Subhash Babu used to use radio
He started his radio from Germany.
And he used to constantly tell the citizens of India about the movement of freedom through radio.
Azad Hind Radio was started from a Weekly News Bulletin.
These radios used to run in all languages in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto, Urdu.
I am also talking about "mind" on Akashwani now it has been a year now.
The matter of my mind has become a matter of your mind in your true sense.
Listen to your words, I think for you, I see your suggestion, with that a race of my ideas starts, which reaches you through the sky.
I speak, but the thing happens to you and this is my satisfaction.
Next month, you will meet again for "mind".
Keep getting your suggestions.
The government also benefits from your suggestions.
Reform begins.
Your contribution is precious for me, precious.
Then once you all get a lot of good wishes.
Thank you.
.
