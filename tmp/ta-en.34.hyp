On 16th day, the coincidence of the Monkey Bath's program - the voice of the mind, the people of the country, enjoy yourself.
Several events are planned in the holidays.
On holidays only the season of mango comes , enjoy sweet potatoes .
Likewise in the daytime if there are some lumps then it can be better .
But this time the horrific heat is dragging the soil in all kinds of pleasures on the four sides .
Despite continuous dryness, all the water conditions start dripping, it's natural to worry about the country.
Sometimes due to aggressions, due to lack of poles, the restrictions in the water coming routes, water conditions also conserve less water than their capacity, due to many years of activity, their conservation capacity is constantly bowing down.
Relaxing dryness, relaxing from the confluence of waterlessness and doing governmental efforts on one side, even citizens can see that they are doing their best efforts to their share.
Awareness is spread in many villages.
The people who experienced hardships for water know what is the importance of water
That's why they're engaged in some organizing activity in a sense of water.
Some days ago someone had told me that the villagers of Hivarre Bazar village of Ahmednagar district and the villages of Punjab had conceived the problem of water .
There may be many villages that want to save water, but after they talk to the farmers, they changed the total croppingpattern, the method of producing.
Whatever yields excessive use of water, it may be black or harvesting, has done the end of not being able to produce such fruits.
Something's easy to hear, but it's not so easy.
Have you seen how many big decisions have been made together
If any factory uses more water, you know what's going on, if you say it's closed the factory.
But look at my farming brothers, don't want much water to be black as soon as they leave.
They do not produce fruits and vegetables in full sufficiently, so that for which the water is required at least it is only produced.
They have succeeded in their own efforts to comprehend the water problem through many sides that they spark, dropping water, rain water consumption, water recharging that rainwater.
Well, I'm talking about a small village Hivere Bazar, but there may be many villages like this.
And for such villagers, I'm demonstrating many lives for the special acts you slave.
Someone told me about Gorwa Gorva village Panchayat located in Tewas district of Madhya Pradesh.
Farm ponds conducted a drive to build ponds.
Only 27 water ponds were built, so the quantity of ground water increased, the water level was high.
Whenever the crops needed water, whenever water was found, they have only 20 percent increase in their agricultural production.
With water consumption, the water level also increased, the level of water was visible.
The world doesn't want to hear about health because of the development of the country's total production.
When Indian government trains mix water with Laddu then it is considered a news for the world .
In the very quick way, the railway department should appreciate the appreciation of the water, at the same time those villagers are also appreciative.
They're gonna be more praised than me.
But many such plans are activated by citizens, they never come to light.
We're glorious to see the good things of government activity, but if we look around, we're trying to solve the problem by doing new methods of dryness.
If there's a good news coming from somewhere, if you're feeling a confluence, the whole confluence is a human nature.
This time there is a possibility of 106 per cent to 110 per cent of the rainy season, I feel like a very comfortable news.
Even though the rainy season is still there, the news about good rainy season is also taking freshness.
But I'm enjoying the news of the people of the country, the good rain, the same way it makes the promise and the sword.
Isn't it the beginning of the drive to save the water of the village
Farmers need soil, it helps them in crops.
Why don't we put the soil in the lakes of the villages in the dwelling grounds
If the soil of the trees grows then, the water consumption of the water conditions will increase
What if empty cement snacks , empty pouches , stones and soil are filled in the ways of water coming out
If the water explodes for 5 days, 7 days, the water will turn into water
The water of the shore itself is high
There's water coming in our ponds.
Stop exiting water as much as possible.
It's possible only when the rainwater is the water of the village, we have to do something to do with this decision.
Today there may be a problem of water supply, there may be dryness, but we have a one-and-a-half-year period.
I'll always say a thing, whenever we go to the birthplace of the Gandhi soldiers, we can see different places, one of them is worth seeing.
It is also known how the ponds in the house were built 200 years ago to save water , how clean that water is .
Mr.
A man named Kumar Krushana writes in mygov synthesis, expresses something in a way.
We're asking us to complete the cleaning of the Ganges in our lifetime.
His concern is very natural, because this work has been done for just 30 years.
Several governments came, many plans were made, the money was spent, so it was natural to raise such questions in many crores of people in the country like brother Kumar Krushana.
Those who believe in time, believe in the Ganges to give home.
I'm supposed to accept the Mahadammia, but I'm supposed to give her life to the Ganges.
The Ganges is our food
The Ganges works for us
The Ganges simplified the power to live all of us.
The way Ganga's journey is over, it gets a speed in the economic activity of the country.
A fugitive brought us the Ganges, but many millions of fugitives need to wait for it.
People cannot succeed in work without partition, so we have to transform into a change agent for purifying, purifying.
Repeat this thing back, remember.
Several attempts are being made in the state level.
Efforts have been made to ensure that all the states are in the Ganges shores .
Trying to unite social and satisfactional structures.
Several operations have been carried out as Surface cleaning, purifying the surface and stopping the industry's masin.
Everyday ventilators mix in large quantities through the slopes .
In order to clean such toilets, the trash skimmers operating in places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna, remove the hut and clean the water swimmers.
It has been given to all the visional structures, which are regularly requested to remove the tube from there.
Everything that's going to be done in a good way, there are 3 டன்s to 11 டன்s every day.
It's really something that's stopping that amount of dirty.
In the days to come and in many places, the plans for the machine to remove this hut will be implemented, its benefits will be easily felt by the people living along the Ganges.
An activity has been organized in collaboration with carbohydrates, furnaces, sugar potatoes, etc. to control the industries.
It's almost starting to act.
My mind seems to have good results even through it.
Some officials have convinced me that it's very pleasure for me to get rid of ero liquid discharge, which has been successful for the past few days.
The exit of the black liquor from the paper table is almost complete.
It shows us that we're traveling in the right direction, there has been an awareness.
Not only on the banks of the Ganges, even if someone with a remote southern corner meets, then it is sure that the Ganges will not be cleaned.
It's a matter of faith in priests that will certainly bring success in cleaning the Ganges.
People who clean the Ganges come to pay their donors.
This structure has been implemented in a very nice way.
I'm the people of the country, today 24th April.
India celebrates this as the Panchayat Raj Day .
Today, the Panchayat raj dynasty started in our country, this organization has been successfully functioning in our democratic administration.
We celebrated the 125th birthday of Baba Saheb Amberg on 14th April, today on the 24th of April, Panchyayat is celebrated.
It is a good thing that has been done in accordance with the fact that any manager has given us the Indian capital legislation, his birthday began, the largest combined villages of the capital legislation, which are both related to this as a prescribed section of the Government of India and the state governments started on April 14th and April 24th to the village till the first Bharat Uday.
On the 14th of April, Baba Saheb Amber's birthday, I believe that I was in his birthplace MHOW.
I found that sacred land the dragon of the panjali.
Today in the month of April 24, most of our tribal brothers are celebrating the Panchayat Raj Day in Jharkhand , this campaign has made a great deal of awareness.
How to strengthen the genetic structures in the village in all parts of India
How to make villages self-sacrifice
How do the villages lock your own development plans
Efforts have been made to ensure the maintenance of the structure, the maintenance of the social structure, the prevention of the school conditions in the villages, the prevention of the child , the prevention of the school rituals, the safety of the female child, the study of the female child, the activity of the products.
Women should celebrate the birthday of the child as a village festival, food programs are being organized in some villages.
Several types of events may take place in ten days in many villages of India, which may be less in abundance.
In the most rooted ways, so many days for the benefit of the villages, for the development of the villages, the power of the Great Great, all the State Governments using it as a chance to demonstrate my lives.
There has been awareness in the villages, which is the warrior of Indian emergence.
The foundation of Bharat Uday is in the village emergence .
That's why we're all paying attention to the village emergence, let's reach the desired benefits.
Dharpure, a member of Mumbai, has conveyed his concern through the phone: Prime Minister, hey, please.
I want to tell you about school, college education.
It has been necessary for the past several years in the educational sector.
Not enough schools or colleges or education.
Even if the kids finish their education, in many ways they don't even know the basic things.
They're always staying behind in our children's world, running.
What's your opinion about this, what kind of change do you want in this area
Please tell us about this.
Thank you.
This is a natural concern.
Today, if every family has the first dream of parents, it's the right to teach the children.
Think about houses, vehicles.
In the minds of people like India, this feeling is Melongi, this is the biggest strength.
Educating children, studying well.
Get a good education, think about it - it's gonna increase further, and be aware.
Children are aware of all this awareness in any family, its impact on schools, teachers are in mind, I'm going to school to get it.
That's why I'm talking about the practices of the school taking a long time, in a wide range of ways to the parents.
If something gets up in mind, you go to school and listen to the teachers.
This awareness must be the way to reduce many disadvantages in our educational system, the participation of the people.
In our country, all the governments have been paying more attention to education, every government has tried to live.
It is true that educational institutions should be expanded, schools, colleges should be formed, teachers should be included, more and more children should go to school.
It's also important to try to spread education in a way.
But the amount of importance on the expansion was more important than that, it must be on our educational level.
We've done the biggest task of expansion.
Now we have to show the lead on quality education.
We must first aim to teach good education now through education.
Until now, the term cases were based on all the structures, now we have to pay attention to the end of the effects.
Till now, we were very careful about how many people came to school, leaving school now, we should pay more attention to learning.
To join school , to join , to join - this mantra has sounded Sata Sarva 's time, but now the children who have gone to school, have to make our poetry on giving them good education and quality education.
You're taking care of the current government's outstanding financial level.
We're trying to pay attention to good education.
It's really what we're gonna have to do a long-night journey.
But if you've decided 125 million people, the long journey will be possible.
Shermila says it's very important that we should make basic changes.
You might have noticed that this time we're away from the observative practice.
It has been said that in the budget, ten government universities, ten private universities and government controls, can choose a competitive route.
I'm telling you what you want to do as the head best corporation.
They're planned to give them full freedom.
The Corporations of India and the Corporations of India can be the competitive working corporations of the world.
The importance of education is in the same quantity as well as the role of technology in education becomes important .
Technologies - I believe that you can easily get our education, in some time its benefits begin to glimpse the eyes.
People have been listening to me for a long time, some have written in an inexplicable mygov, some have been indicted in narendramodiap, many young people have written.
Call them the Prime Minister.
I'm talking to Mona Karna from Piznor.
In today 's age the game is also very important for young people with education .
In them, the team must be feeling, the good president is the nature, through which they have a complete development.
I'm telling you through my experience, because I'm in the formation of the Indian San Sanctuary, it's a good impact on my life.
I'd like you to predict a large number of small communities.
I want the government to inculcate in large quantities to national student force, folk health program, Bharat Sancharan Sanctuary etc.
You're all giving me the instructions, after seeing it, before I talk to you, I thought I'd talk to these structures.
Because of your pressure, because of your suggestions, I have now joined a group, in which the head of the National Student Party, the folk health plan, the Sancharan Sanctuary, the Sanctuary, the Nehru Yuva Kendra.
They're the first time they're gonna have such a crowd when you've ever met them, no, after the country's independence, for the first time.
I'm supposed to tell my deeds to young friends who have pressed me on all these works.
As a result, this group was organized, I think this meeting was beneficial.
It required a lot of coordination.
They do a lot of work in their own ways, but socially, comprehensively, can make a great effect when they support our various structures, huh
Their swelling is wide, they've reached many families.
They gave me this extension of their mind.
They've seen a lot of enthusiasm, something to do.
I really know that I've been listening to the National Scholars at a time, there's a national synergy that a new emergence would arise through such structures.
In my old age, I experienced the benefits, I need to fill a new energy in these structures, give new instruments.
This way I'm keeping some things in front of them.
During this season, why don't we work for our youth, all the organisations and water consumption.
How many circles, how many districts can we stop expulsion in the open open.
How can you get rid of open excretion
What kind of plans can be made to join the combination, what can the general youth of all the organisations be
I've been mixed with him about many things.
There are many types of organisations for the youth among us.
I'm gonna advise all of yours about what kind of new things can be linked to us in their procedures, plans.
If you write in my narendramodiap, I'm mixing it with the right place, after this meeting, the process of structures will increase, I believe you'd like to connect you with them, this kind of situation happens.
I've gotta talk about the thing we need to think about today, in the people of the country.
I'm looking at it and I'm sorry.
You're nice to know how much the party will give to the burning slinders that the last several legislatures were in the subject matter, the political situation of our country was.
Twelve slinders aren't 9 Silinders
This was the biggest assembly.
If every political party, the central government wants to concentrate on the agenda, the burning slinder was the biggest thing.
On the other hand, economic scientists were pressurized to reduce minerals, due to which many groups were formed, they gave suggestions and decisions regarding maniac deficiency.
This group costs several crores of rupees.
But there's no progress in the situation.
It was a common experience for everyone.
Nobody thought of it.
Today, folks, I'm glad to show you your predecessor.
I've done the third method, it's the way I trust people.
Sometimes ourselves in the kingdom should have more faith in your dependents than you.
I trusted people, if you could accept up to Rs 1500 to 2000 for a year, why don't you hate the burning pig, that's a natural motive that's helping a damn thing.
But today my heart gets hungry because of the masses on my people.
A million guys, you're looking forward to your burning jewelry, these aren't all a million soldiers.
In these, there are rested teachers, rested gumastas, peasants, small shops, middle classes, low middle class people.
They're looking for this jewelry.
Look at the second specialty, they'll be done in many ways through mobile ap, online or through the Mist-car in the phone.
But if you see, more than 80 percent of these codes have gone to the university, guys in sequence, wipe your swords by giving them in writing.
I don't think it's a little bit about the people of the country.
If the government gives a sequence in some jurisdiction, the television and news reports throughout the week will be appreciated by the rains of the government.
A code of families have been deserted, seeing, our country's artifacts have been authorized in a way, and that's the kind of merchandise.
First of all, I'm demonstrating to those a codec family many hundred of my faults, to see lives.
Because they are supposed to make political leaders sure to be reflected in a new era.
This is one of the present, the economic scientists of the country are sure to reflect in the new era.
Not even the economic scientists of the world, before many kinds of possibilities, this is a disappearance of their thinking.
It's about something to be reflected in an order.
And a codec family is deserving jealous, instead of gaining burning cylinders for a crores of poor families, even if a codec family hates money, it is a mixed financial, even if it appears to be a simple thing, it shows what can be slaughtered when people relieve on people.
I'm asking everywhere we're gonna believe in people there must be something to say to all the political leaders.
You got the favours you can't even see sympathy.
We have to travel in this direction.
For example, the 3rd position, why should the 4th standard worker choose, we shouldn't trust why on their assessments.
My mind also imagines that sometimes the ticket checkers don't have to be.
You can't do it
Let's trust the people
You can see how many tests are done.
Once we believe in the people of the country, we'll have unprecedented benefits.
That's all I've told you something about my mind.
It can't be made by any government law.
But the environment can be something.
Isn't it
This circumventure hasn't been a political leader, a million families of the country.
A man named Ravy wrote to me: Good News Everyday, good sister every day.
Tell your officers that you should tell us about a good thing every day.
In every message, in the communication, the bad news is breaking news.
125 million people don't have any good thing in our country
Please change this situation, Ravy shows her own sympathy.
I think Ravy is expressing his anger, he's not angry at me, angry at the situation.
The former President of India, APJ Abdul Kalam, has ever come to tell him that he'll trace good news on the first side of the news.
A few days ago, a letter was sent to me.
We've been supposed to send a bad news on the day of the morning, and tell me the news of the preparation.
Well, I've always seen the time being expelled from a few spectacular messages.
Something's really what's happening to make-up messages.
Everybody feels good news, real messages.
Whatever an excellent person gives special attention, even if he describes it through so many beautiful words, in a very beautiful manner, he gets more benefit than that through good news.
Good news gets prescribed for good actions.
It's true that the quantity we're beneficial, the amount of harm will be reduced.
If we put the evil, we'll get away with yourself, of course.
We're operating an integral library called Transforming India in the state.
There are reports made in this.
In this portal, you can send, if you have some good news, not only the government's creative activities.
You can also share in it.
Ravy, they're, you're giving good advice.
But please don't worry about me.
Let's try to make things connected to us, share the efforts to make things fit and make-up.
The Kumbh Mela is the specialty of our country.
Kumbh fair can be tourist attraction .
Many people in the world have been aware that hundreds of people come to the bank of the river for many days .
With peaceful mind, the fair is full of peaceful environment.
These events grabble the greatest standards, in the programme sequence, as partition of people.
I've been taking care of the past two days of showing the pictures related to the Simhasth Kumbh Mela.
I want the tourism department of Indian government and tourism departments of state government to run this smoking competition .
People can ask you to pay the most important smokes.
We can see a big change in the environment, and in the same way people know how different things are going on during the Kumbh fair.
It can be done sure.
When the first man of Madhya Pradesh met me, I'm sure he'd pay special attention to sanitation.
The sacred purpose is not only for this fair, but from there people have to shine the darkness of sacredness in their minds.
At the time of the Kumbh Mela, I assume that if I accept a fair related to spirit, that too can be a social opponent.
It can also make it possible to have good habits.
From there, good decisions, good habits, etc. can be transformed by the fact that the village can skip it.
How can we raise our nation on water, how can we drive the water, we can use the Kumbh Mala in the field of water squaring.
I'm supposed to demonstrate my grandeur on this important day of Panchayat raj in the people of the country.
Sometimes even now I'm sorry to distribute the voices of your mind.
It enjoys me.
Thank you once again
.
