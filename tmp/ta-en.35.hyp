On the day 2016, the speech of the sounding Monkey Pat program, the voice of the mind, the people of the country, please describe you to me.
Today people from all over the world are celebrating Eastern trinity .
I'm telling you all the nails of Easter's wedding.
My young friends, you're all on one side of the choice.
Some of the choices may have been completed.
Some people can make it a different way, because if there's a choice on one side, 20 competitions for the World Crown are going on again.
Even today you are defending the Australian cat.
In the past, India, Pakistan and other countries have achieved specially in the fight against the treasures.
A fair festival is held.
Today, if India is shouting with Australia, I'm demonstrating my life with two dresses.
It wasn't right that 65 percent of the people were young and in the game world we couldn't finish the muddle.
It's time for a revolution in the field of sports.
Now in India, like cricket, there is a very charming mood for cattle, hockey, tannis, etc.
I'm telling young people a happy news today, and I'll show you some neighbours.
You may know that in the next year of 2017, India FIFA WIDER-17 is running the World Cupboy competition in our country.
The 24 dresses of the world are playing in India.
1951, 1962, the Asian Magazine won India's shelter.
1956 The French Market got India 4th place.
But in the last few decades, we're supposed to be very low in line.
We've come to find the storm.
Now if FIFA has seen the level of our waterfall on the line, it's also confused to leave the mouth.
The EPL, the Spanish League, the Indian Super League Storms, today I've been looking at increasing the interest of the Indian youth on the climate.
The youth of India are watching TVs to know more about the football.
If you're saying this, it's advisable to increase the interest of the football.
But the greatest chance is that we can only commit ourselves from the insurgents of India
No, we're gonna make a round of sweat all over the year, in schools, colleges, Indian youths in India, our school students, all bathed in sweat.
Playing calculations on all the four sides.
If we do this, we're gonna have a way to enjoy the calibration fighters.
At the same time, we can use this vision and enjoy the clutches carrying every village, every street.
If the 2017 FIFA ENDER-17 is a possible world cycle, in this orange, we need a new excitement to destroy the calculation within the youths of all the four sides.
There's a simple assumption that we're in the forefronts of these cattle, that the conveniences of the calculation will be clutched to it.
The important facilities for the game will be paid attention.
I can enjoy myself only when every day joins the club.
Friends, I'm looking forward to you.
How can we use this opportunity of competition in the year 2017 , how to spread the information about our plans in the field of calculation, how to enhance the compositions of the institutions, how to enhance the sports of the Indian youth in the middle of the game , how to enhance the sports of the game in governments, educational institutions and other social organisations
In the same way, we're all interested in Grickette, we have to bring such a situation in other sports.
Calcutta competitions are a nice chance.
Can you give me your advice related to this
I think it's a chance to brand India in the world.
I think it's a nice opportunity to mark the strength of the young people of India.
I didn't come to say that we were in the cattle, Jeythoma.
We can bury our comprehension through this bond, show strength, even if we can brand India.
Didn't you send your suggestions to me about this in Narendra ModiApp
How to be Logo, how to be the advertising courses, India should follow my methods to propagate it, how to be songs, how to be memorable, how to make them all.
Put your ideas on horses, guys, I'm supposed to be the smartest man for this 2017 FIFA world shield.
You're also involved in it, it's golden sight to insist a symbol of India.
You're planning to go to tour in my school, holidays.
Most of the people go abroad, most of them go to tour in their respective states for 5 days, 7 days.
Some people leave their states and go to other states.
Even last time, I had a proposal with you, where you're going, give me the smoke of that place.
Whatever work could not be done by the tourism sector, which was not done by our cultural department, which was not done by state governments, Indian governments, that work was done by millions of people living in the country.
When they see all the smokes they pay, really enjoy.
We have to move this work forward, do the same way, but this time you add another one.
Not only sending smoking, but also showing your confrontation, you can know many things even when you go to new places.
Whatever thing we cannot acquire in classes, what can not be acquired in the family, what we cannot even know in our friends, they can learn more when they travel in a few times, new places create a new experience in us.
How many things can be seen in the lifestyle of people, language, food and going places.
A traveler without observation is a bird without wings, that comes to memorize someone who says a fucking bird.
Interesting to see the scenes, make an eye on it.
India's rich country.
If you're starting to see once, you're just traveling all your life, you're just having a fun.
Your mind's always plenty, that's the luck I've done for the sake of traveling in that way.
When I wasn't the first or the prime minister, I've seen a lot of rounds when I was like you.
It's a doubt that the district I didn't leave in India.
Tourists have the biggest power to create our lives, nowadays Indian youth show more interest in tourism, their enthusiasm is increasing.
They don't travel on the old-fashioned road, or built, they want to make something new, see something new.
I think it's a good symbol.
Our young men must be compassionate, wherever no one answers, they must be interesting before stepping.
I'm supposed to appreciate my special appreciation to the Coal Andia Institute.
Western coalfields limited, the WCL organization has moulded tunnels in the place named Sawaneer near Nagpur.
They're the Eco Friendly Mine Tourism Circuits that enhance the musical tourism for the environment.
Ordinarily, the moon should be away from the tunnels.
You know what happens when you see pictures about the people there
There is also a case in our area that if you blacken hands then others will come away automatically .
But it is very pleasant to make tourism a tourist place keeping the same moongyard .
This is the beginning only , till now only ten thousand more people have experienced musical marble surroundings for the environment situated near Sawaner village near Nagpur .
It makes a new possibilities.
When you go to other places during this holiday, can you divide yourself with sanctity
Anyway, there's definitely a thing that can be seen, the amount may be less, it's the same way it's done, but it's sure it's a new awareness.
In the tourist places people are very fond of satisfaction .
Tourists also take care of this , people living in tourist places also give their contribution to sanctity .
It may not be done very scientific, but it's true to walk.
Can you also work as a tourist in the form of a pure environment in the tourist center
I believe my young friends are definitely helping me in this work.
The fact is that tourism is a field that makes a lot of work.
If you come to the tourist spot , you can also get rid of the ropes .
Even if the rotten tourists go, they buy something.
If the tourist gets cheaper, he'll spend more.
In comparison to the world tourism is staying very close in India .
But if 125 crores of people decide that we have to strengthen the tourism sector, we can attract the world.
We can attract a large part of the tourists of the world to us, we can provide jobs to millions of young people in our country.
Princes, organisations, social, citizens, join us in this work.
Come on, let's get rid of this direction.
My young friends, I didn't like the situation that had gone, sometimes.
You also smile in this eyeball.
Your holiday days, the important years of life, can't you swear their sympathetic moments
I'm preferring a blackness to your child.
You can enhance an efficiency during your holidays, can add a new thing like proud of your family
If you don't know the swimming, I'll learn to swim in the holidays, I'll decide if you don't know the drive of the bike, you'll learn the drive.
Even today, if I'm typing with two fingers in the computer, I'm gonna do a switch
How many types of capabilities to enhance our family, aren't they
Why don't we learn them
Why don't we remove our disadvantages
Why don't we raise our colour
Now look at the sympathy, it doesn't need big pilgrimages, no trainer needs, no more fees, no bigger cost.
You can also decide that even one of your nearest things, for example, make things made up of excavation.
Look carefully, then you start doing it.
You're enjoyed, when you're watching around the evening, you're cooking the minaret from the hut.
If you don't want a picture, but if you don't come, you start, come on yourself.
In the days of the holidays, enhancing your rule, developing a new efficiency with you, necessitating to increase your power, you can do this in the evaluated sectors, I don't need to do the same in the fields.
Your guy gets marked by it, increases your self-confidence.
Once you do, after the holidays, when you go to school, college, I'll tell you I've learned it in these holidays, that fellow wouldn't have learned anything, at that time, Mr. Nanpa, I've left my holidays, but you'll say you're doing well.
Like this, I'm talking to other friends.
I believe you'll definitely do it.
Tell me what you're learning new.
Don't you say
This time there are some suggestions on the mygov gallery in the cheek of the mind.
My name is AB squarewell.
Well, the Prime Minister, when you were the summer holidays, the birds also drive the heat of summer, so we should keep them water in a pot in the walls of the house, so that they will get water.
I was very happy to do this work, through which the nanda flowed to me with a lot of birds.
I'm asking you to repeat it again in your mind.
Thank you.
I'm the people of the country, I've got a lot of treachery to them.
This boy has memorized a thing I've forgotten.
I don't mind to tell you about this, but last year I've remembered saying that I should keep a mud out of the house for birds.
My folks, I'm supposed to be grateful to the boy of AB squarewell.
He's reminded me of a good function by contacting the phone.
I remember the last time I told you.
I was asking you to fill the water in the ground utensils outside your home during the summer.
I've been supposed to have done this work for the whole year.
He has also said that many birds have chosen him through this.
Among the great poets of the world of Hindi literature , Mahadevi Varma , he was having a magnificent devotion on birds .
He won't allow you to go away from his poems, fill the rice with cereals, he's supposed to fill the cold insufficient water, wherever.
I'm supposed to appreciate AB's my admiration, and you're reminding me of the most important thing.
Shilpa Khoke with Mysore has put a very efficient black in front.
We're gonna come to sell milk, news stars come, parents, sometimes buyers, cloth sellers.
Have we ever heard that if they want water to thirst the summer temperature
Have we ever given them water
Shilpa, thanks to you for me, you've preferred very emotional blackness in a very natural way.
The thing is small, but when a patron comes home during summer, how much would he do if we gave him water.
In India this hypocrisy is natural.
But I'm demonstrating you to see you paying attention to such a tricky thing.
I'm farming brothers, you're more concerned about digital India.
In some people this digital India can be seen as a matter of youth in some cities .
That's not the same, you've been familiar with the App of the facility of farmers.
If these farmers are comfortable for AppI, you'll get all the information related to farming, vonile in your handloom.
What's the situation in the markets, what's the situation in the markets, how good operations are going to be, so many information can be obtained from any kind of pesticides.
Not only that, if you press a note in it, it will make you related to agricultural scientists or farmers.
If you ask any questions in them, you answer it or keep yourself in writing.
I want my agricultural brothers to get the App for the facility of these farmers in your mobile phone.
I'm just trying to find out if it's helping you.
If you think there's something wrong in it, tell me your deficiencies.
My farming brothers, others may be the summer holiday season.
But for the farmers it changes the sweat of the sweat.
They weep on the way that rain ever comes, before it comes, keep your land ready and save your life in the night.
Only then can you use a drop of rain water without swelling.
The initial period of farming for farmers is one of the most important .
But we have to imagine what the people of the country are going to get waterless.
Our water conditions, the flowing paths in our neighbourhood, the slopes of water coming in the lakes and the storms, the water coming stops.
Because of this the swelling of water starts slowly reducing .
Once again, we cleaned those old places, couldn't be busy in the way of excessive water consumption
How many waters can be conserved by us, even if we mix water in the first rain, if the water conditions are filled, our rivers and ponds are filled, even if they fall back, we'll have less damage.
This way you may have noticed that 5 lacs of lakes , ponds and dwellings are being carried out .
Manreka takes the survival of making supplies for water consumption.
The village has to mix water, how to save every drop of water in the rainy season.
Accomplish the operation of the village's water village, you plan, connect you with the government plans, start a people's operation, through which the importance of water, the importance of all knowing, all the water conservation can be united.
There may be many such aware villages in the country, leading farmers may be strong, many academic citizens.
But now it has to be done with more explanation.
I'm the farm brothers, I'm once again deciding this thing to you.
A few days ago, the Indian government had arranged for a very big farmers' fair, when I could see what modern technology has been discovered, what changes have come to the farm sector, but also the farmers have started saying that they should be brought to the crops, to reduce the use of liquids.
I'm gonna welcome it.
The wrong use of many leprosys causes our mother to die, so we can see how our mother is sick.
By mixing good spicy substances , the food becomes soft, but if the same spice is mixed in more quantity, you feel like eating .
You don't mind if you're supposed to be a minute
That's the same thing, uram, even if you're supposed to use more leather, that's the same way to destroy.
Each thing needs good, it'll cost less, your money is also sweet.
We're gonna have to take out the scientific methods in mind, to advance our farming.
In the matter of water consumption, we're gonna take all the important tasks, and we're gonna have to spend more than one and a half months in the rainy season.
The amount of water that is conserved, it is the benefit of all the farmers, that amount of conservation in life.
I mean, on the 7th day of the month of April, the World Health Day, its focus is beat diabetes, that the disease of diabetes can be averted.
A disease called diabetes is a symptom of visiting other diseases .
Once diabetes has occurred , after that the diseases afflicted will make the body healthy .
In the year 2014 there were only 612 crore diabetes patients in India.
The diagnosis shows that 3 percent of the total deaths occur due to diabetes .
Diabetes will be of two types, one type 1 and the other type 2.
Type 1 is genetically genetic, heereditary, due to mother father, it also happens to a child.
Type 2 is due to habits, age, obesity.
We're gonna have to switch it off.
Diabetes has become a cause of concern throughout the world that it has been established at the center of World Health Day on 7th day .
Our lifestyle is a big reason for this.
Body work comes down.
We don't grow clean sweat, there's no walking.
Sports are also playing in the computer, not computer-free games.
Have we got pregnancy on the 7th of the month of April , we could get down as a result of diabetes in our lives .
If you don't want to do yoga then stay in it, otherwise you can practice Odio walking.
If every dweller of my country is healthy, I'm also healthy.
Sometimes we don't get medical check-up done with confusion.
It is only after the situation has worsened that IO has been diabetes for a long time .
Whatever you're going to get checked, I'll do it, now there are all the facilities.
It'll walk very simple.
Definitely do this.
On the 24th day of March the World Black Disease has been marketed everyday .
My young age, I remember people getting scared just after asking the name of TB.
That's how, you're gonna decide the death.
But now everyone knows that there is no fear of tuberculosis because there is relief in tuberculosis.
One time we're obsessed with death related to tuberculosis, but now we're less careful about tuberculosis.
Our country is less than the number of tuberculosis patients living in other countries.
If you want to get rid of tuberculosis then proper treatment is important .
If you leave half the treatment in the middle, you'll get the disease again.
The surrounding surroundings also know the quantity of tuberculosis that test whether or not the tuberculosis has occurred.
Coughing arises , fever occurs , if the body comes thin then the symptoms of tuberculosis occurring or occurring due to tuberculosis also arise .
I mean, it's possible to get the treatment immediately after knowing whether it's a disease.
My countrymen are undergoing researches in this mirror.
There are more than 13,500 microscopy centers.
There are more than 4 lakh dot projects.
There are many major tests, all the services are available free.
Please get the test done once.
This disease can be solved by proper treatment .
Disease of tuberculosis, diabetes, we need to scratch them.
India should be released from the clutches of these diseases .
But you cannot afford them with only governments, doctors, medicines without your help.
That's why I'm asking the people of the country that we have to absorb the diabetes disease, to absorb the tuberculosis.
There are many important possibilities in my countrymen, April.
Especially on the 14th day of April, Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambettkar's birthday.
His 125th birthday was celebrated throughout the year.
Mhow-Moh was born, he studied in London, his political life began in Nagpur, on 26 Alipur Roads of Delhi, the possibility of his Mahabari dynasty was to be held, we will be able to improve these five sacred places in the memory of his intellectual crickets in Mumbai.
On the 14th day of April this year Baba Saheb Ambatkar got the survival of his birthplace to Maha .
Baba Saheb has given us all that needs to be an excellent dweller.
He traveled in a forested way, lived with a good dweller, we could see him a special panorama.
We'll start the Vikram Year in a few more days.
Buddhist year is celebrated in various forms in different states .
Some people call it a new festival meaning Buddha Year, some people call it Gudi-Padwa, some call it a verse pattern, some call it Ukati.
But in almost all the places of India there is a significance for this.
Everyone lives in my Buddhist year.
I've already told you that you can hear the hole of my mind whenever you do, you know it.
Let's hear this in just 20 languages.
Let's ask it when you're glad.
Let's hear it in your mobile phone.
Only if you give one of the mist claws.
This service starts only a month's time.
But 35 lakh people have benefited from this.
You also have to count the oil 81908-81908.
I know the oil again.
81908-81908.
You give Miss foot, when you get time, then you can ask the old mind's voice programs, ask for your language.
I'm glad to join you.
I'm the people of the country, live for you my nephew.
Thank you very much.
.
