On the 16th day of the All India Radio, the Prime Minister's speech of the voice program, the people, the people of the country.
I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi in the morning, and in the days to come, the sports related enthusiasm of the whole country will increase the enthusiasm of every young man.
We all know that in some more days the world's biggest camp of games is going on.
Rio says our ears are constantly rolling.
French people will be involved in the games.
All the countries of the world will pay attention to the exhibition of your sportsmen, you will also pay attention.
In our mind there are adventurous desires and applauses, and in the same way, the sportsmen who have been playing in Rio were the fondness and beliefs of 125 million people.
Next day in Delhi, Indian government run for Rio, play, live
Playing, making an excellent arrangement for development.
In the days to come, we'll spend somewhere in the way we're enjoying our sportsmen.
If there's a sportsman eight in this quantity, he's supposed to break this position only after a very hard effort.
It's a sort of hardest poem in a way.
If there's so much hope on food, they're gonna have to harass everything.
You may have a desire to take a fight during the winter, still bed should be blown up in the field.
It's not just a sportsman, even his parents, those warriors who spend their strength in the health of the kids, with the same rapid, immortality.
There's no sports valor at night.
He's born after the most serious dream.
Even if the success and defeat are important, with this, the eightth of this position in the game is important.
That's why the folks will demonstrate our lives to all our sportsmen who went to Rio Thethem.
I'm ready to take this job from your level.
The Prime Minister of the country is ready to join your lives with our sportsmen.
Send your lives to our sportsmen in the narendramodi app, I'll bring your lives to them.
I'm smiling with you to develop the confidence and enthusiasm of the sportsmen, as a dweller like 125 crore folks.
Come on, let's all be able to enjoy every sportsman in the day we're all sweet.
Today, I've been talking about Rio Theatre, read a poem sent by a student who likes a poem from the Central University of Punjab, Suraj Prakash.
Like him and many poets may have written so many poems in this darkness, some may have become soft songs, in every language this may have happened, but today Suraj wants me to share the poem he wrote to me.
The game's starting to raise competitions.
In this Kumbh Mela for sports...
Rio, pleasure...
Get us a good start.
The gold and the silver silver silver.
Problems will grow in our lives.
Don't worry about Tholvey's marks on the gold.
The survival of multi-colored people.
Promise me.
We fly in Rio too.
Suraj, they are, I appreciate your feelings to all these sportsmen, and I'm supposed to fly our flags in Rio, from my level, from the 125 million folks.
Mr.
A young man named Angith remembers me the memory day of the former president of the kingdom of Kalam.
Last week, Samban Kalam gave his memorable day to the country, the world of sweetness.
But whenever the tales are called, then a future picture of science, technology, technology, powerful India, stands in our eyes.
In that way, Sammel Kalam has asked you what your government has been trying to wear their dreams
It's okay to tell you.
Technologies are very unconstitutional.
Every day technology changes, new forms, new effects, changes are constantly discovered.
You can't hold the technology, so if you like it, then it's rolling in a remote place, a new form.
And if we make our way music, research and renewal must be done, that's the life of technology.
If the research and renewables do not exist, the technique will become a weight to us as well as how the drainage starts in the frozen water.
If we don't take research and renewables, depend on the old technology, we'll be evacuated in the changing times.
That's why our small socialists should develop the sex of science, technology, sex of research, etc. in mind, and the government has made many efforts to do this.
That's why I'm calling Let us to innovate, to regulate newcomers.
So when I say AIM, it means Atal Innovation Mission.
This Atal Innovation Mission, the Nation Committee is encouraging plans to create newcomers.
Through this Atal Innovation Mission, there is an idea of creating an environment full of innovation, experiment, entrepreneurship, that is, innovation, testing, industrialization, etc. across the country, if this process continues, the probability of new jobs in the country will increase.
If we want to create new guys for the next guy, we have to connect our priests with this plan.
That's why the Indian government has taken the lead of Atal Tinkering Labs.
Wherever such spinning centers are established in schools, they will be paid 10 lakh rupees, 5 years of recruitment and 10 lakh rupees.
Like this, the newly created incubation center is directly connected.
If we have powerful, incubation centers, release newcomers, search for startups, get them accumulated, and we get the necessary structure.
In the same way, it is important to strengthen the old centres, to establish a new structure center.
When I speak about Atal Incubation Center, the government is also concerned about giving 10 crores of rupees for this.
India has met many problems.
Our eyes are complicated in our daily life.
Now we need to find technical solutions.
Like Atal Grand Challenges, we're calling for a young guy of the country to communicate the help of technology in a way of demonstrating your eyes.
The Government of India wants to enjoy special awards for the techniques found in the form of arranging our problems.
When we talk about the tinkering lab, we've been pursuing more than 13,000 schools, we've discovered about the creation center, the education sir and education systems have preserved to set up more than 4,000 centers.
I'm determined to find solutions through technology for the problems we meet in our daily life, to get rid of our places.
Whatever our young heads pay attention to these, their share in the cooking of the modern India of the 21st century will be greater, this is the question that will be the real sympathetic to their memories.
My folks, sometimes ago, drew concerns about the cotton in our minds, and the rains are enjoying, and there are reports about flooding.
State governments and central governments are engaged in full efforts to help the victims of floods.
Even if there are some places due to rain, they all develop in every human mind, because the central point of all our economic activity is rain, farming.
Sometimes the diseases that keep us hungry all over life are also a victim of us.
But if we wake up, we're gonna shut up, they're smooth and smooth.
You can only take Dengue fever.
We can save us from dengue fever.
We have to pay attention to sanctity, to be aware, to try to rescue, to pay attention to the children, to abandon the idea that this dengue disease is the arrival of some harvest drink.
We have to understand that Dengue will give all the richest houses first.
Even after watching the advertisements in TV, sometimes it's obvious to take action against this fever.
Even if all the governments, hospitals, doctors are doing their jobs, we should be aware of not allowing dengue in our homes, our families in our homes, no disease that can be caused by water, that's why I approve you all.
And folks, I want to turn back your attention to me about a problem.
If life has become impatient and fast, sometimes it's too late to think of us.
When you get sick, you think you're gonna need some antibiotic to be finished.
The habit of applying a antibiotic can make a very terrible confluence even if you get any disease free.
If you want some கணs, you can get relief, but you must stop the habit of taking antibiotic without consulting the doctors.
Until doctors don't write, we'll save us from them, we're not traveling through this trail, because it'll only increase new complications.
If the patient gets relief from anything that is because of the concentrated antibiotics , the disease microbes have been finished in these medicines , then they are unable to use these medicines .
After this, a struggle begins again, finding new medicines, studying scientific research spending many years in the world, in which diseases create new confluences, we must be aware of this.
And there has been a concert - If the doctor recommends taking 15 antibiotic pills in 5 days, please complete the amount of the doctor mentioned in the follow-up .
Don't leave it halfway
The microbes will be weak due to half a bit, even if they take more than required, the microbes will be weak.
So how many pills should be recommended for how many days it should be finished.
The body has become healthy, if we leave half-a-half that I don't need, they become more powerful for microbes.
The microbes produced by malaria , tuberculosis etc . are unable to change medicines and enhance the opposite power of medicine .
It's very fast to have an impact.
In the medical context, it is called antibiotic resistance, so it is important to follow the methods that take them in the same way, how to use antibiotics.
The government is sure to stop antibiotic resistance
You may have noticed the antibiotic species that will be sold all the time on the leather, which makes you aware, so pay attention to it.
When we talk about health, I want to add another thing to it.
The pregnant mothers in our country have a lot of concern in some ways .
Every year only 3 crore women are pregnant in our country, but some mothers die while breastfeeding, some infants are dying during delivery.
Sometimes both mother and child may die.
In the last few decades, there has been a fall in the age of the mothers' deaths, even though the condition of the pregnant mothers is unable to save us more even today.
During pregnancy, there is no state of disorder of blood behind it, infections related to reproductiveness, high blood pressure.
With all this, the Government of India has undertaken a new campaign for the past few months - Prime Minister Surkshid Madhav Abhiyan , that is the safe motherhood plan of the Prime Minister .
According to this project every pregnant mother and state medical center will be conducted every month on 9th day, formal examination.
It will be spent in all the government hospitals on 9th day per month after spending the visa .
I'm asking for all the poor families that the pregnant women in your house will get the benefit of this service given on 9th day every month.
If there is any possibility of complication at the time of 9th month, it will be comfortable to make arrangements for it.
I have been asking the Health Officers to save the lives of both mothers and sisters, especially on the 9th day of every month, that the poor mothers could not do such a service freely.
Can't my physician brothers dedicate themselves to this work for 12 days in Orand
In the past, many have written to me a letter.
Thousands of doctors come under my guidance to sevision, but India's largest country, millions of doctors should join you in this campaign.
I believe you'll definitely join you in it.
My countrymen, today all over the world are worried about weather changes, world warmth, environmental works.
In the middle of the country and the world there are discussions related to this .
India has been confronting this idea for centuries.
Even in the Kurukshetra war Lord Shri Krishan tells us about the trees of warfare and the concerns of the trees and concerns of them.
Lord Krishna in the poet, Absolutely: Sarvavrukshanaam, in some trees I called the prince.
Shukra Nitio, the nervous system says that there is no vegetation without medical quality.
The guessing festival of Mahabharata is in a very wide manner like that tree-made child, which does not have any doubt.
Anyone who gives the tree a donation, the tree will be helpful in mixing him across the world like a familiar mucket selva.
That's why, the mother-father, who thinks of your health, dress good trees, must be treated with their microscopes.
Our vegetarian singer, suicidal, the guidance of the Mahabharata, the things found in which are still alive in your sights.
The example of a woman Sonel of Pune was attracted to me, it was my mind year.
It is said that in the festival of Mahabharata, the trees also enhance the boundaries of Mukt Selva.
Sonal accepts the wishes of not only his mother's father's wishes, but also the desires of the whole community.
Khandu Marti Mahadre , the farmer of Narayanpur village in Junnar Taluka adjoining the Pune of Maharashtra .
He celebrated his grandfather Sonal's wedding as a refreshment.
All the relatives, friends, residents who came to Sonel's wedding gave Casar Manjadi love to everyone.
When I saw the picture in the social museum, the trees were seen in the surroundings.
It's a fascinating vision.
He's one of the ideas he's supposed to give love to a peacock rock in marriage even in Sonel.
Look what the nature of the world is showing in a very nice way.
In a way Sonal's marriage is the kingdom of Nature.
I'm demonstrating Mr. Mahatray's life in Sonal and his efforts to make this guy.
Many of these attempts are being done by force.
During the first time of Gujarat , during the month of Batra , in the temple of Amba Devi situated there , a large number of patriots are seen coming .
Once a social service manufacturing, giving a wooden dress to the people who came to worship the cow, brought it to your village, Mother Amba told you that she would continue to give her wishes.
Many lakhs of immigrants who came to that year have also provided millions of tree trees.
Temples can also start the tradition of giving trees of wood in the rainy season instead of prasad .
It's a wooden walking-related people.
If I ask my farmer brothers again, why shouldn't we raise tea trees instead of sweating our lands by setting trees on the borders of our crops
Today we have to make things like householding in India, making churches, we have to die from foreign countries.
We're supposed to shut up such trees in our woods, they're helpful in wooden shoes, after 10-15 years, we can cut off the government's permission and save them, it's going to be a way to enhance your income, reducing the cost of the woods of India.
For the last few days many states used to use this season in a simple manner and conducted several operations .
The Government of India has now formulated a law called CAMPA.
Accordingly, more than 40,000 crore rupees of trees are available to the States.
The state of Maharashtra is only 2 in the state on the 1st day of July .
I've been informed that 25 crores of trees are drained.
Next year, three cottage trees have already been decided.
The government has organized a public campaign.
Rajasthan is a sandy region.
There also a large quantity of jungle festival has been celebrated and 25 lakh trees have been decided .
It's not a small task to start 25 lakh trees in Rajasthan.
The people who know about the land of Rajasthan know how big it is .
In Andhra Pradesh it has been decided to increase the greenery of 50 percent in 2029 .
The Central Government has implemented green India missile, green India campaign for its share.
In it, the railway is also covering his partition.
In Gujarat also there is a very famous tradition of forest festival .
This year several types of schemes have been set up in Gujarat in the name of maar forest , acadha forest , Shaheed forest , in which several lake trees have been constructed .
I couldn't even mention all the states worthy of appreciation.
Yet you're all worthy of appreciation.
I've got a chance for the Afghans in the past, in the people of the country.
It's my first flight to Afghan
Internal agreements are made in many areas in the state of international travel as well as related organisms , global disputes and security related dialogues .
But it's comparable to a pilgrimage in a way that the Afghan travel is based on me.
It's a natural thing to get up in mind the memories of Gandhijis, Amason Mandelas while thinking about Afghan.
When the words like Akims, Nation, Manital fall into ears, Gandhians, Mandela's sermons appear before us.
I had to go to Phoenix City on a part of my Afghan trip.
The residence of Gandhiji is known by the name of Sarvodaya .
The soldiers who traveled in the train , whoever saw the possibility of Mohantas being converted into Gandhiji , found that the Peter Marrieds Burg railway station to travel .
I've got the chance to meet many important men who sacrificed your young age for equality, civilization, etc. this time.
The people who spent their lives in prisons for 20-25 years fought together with the skin of mud.
In a way, they sacrificed your slave young man, Ahmat Katata, close to Mundella, Lalu, Seeba Way, George Pesos and Roney Cashralls.
Even though they were the path of the Indian dynasty, they were drunk and lived as folks.
For those who lived in the middle, they were ready to kill their lives.
When I was talking to them, when they were asking for their prison experiences, they didn't see anyone in their mind and no curiosity, there was no misery.
Even after all this big treachery, they don't see a little bit in their faces when you feel your sacrifices worthy.
On the other hand , there was a royal royal skirmish in the snake .
These memories in my mind are observed for ever.
There is no bigger mantra than any community, prince, equality, equality.
All equal, all the ways to take us to our light future feelings as ours.
We'd like to live your life.
Looks like our children's future should be special.
Everybody's needs are different, our advances are different, the path is something, that path progress, equality, equality, all equality, all the feelings of M.J.
Come on, even in the Afghan, we'll gather these Indians who have lived the original mantras of our life.
To send me this information to the people of myself, I'm very close to him, Shilpy Varma, his concern is very natural.
He remembers me a present.
He's the Prime Minister, from Bangalore I'm speaking Shilpy Verma.
I read in a news report at the end that a young lady lost 11 lakh rupees in a mosquito and a bright jewellery.
I'm very sorry about her family status even in a woman's way.
I want to know what your opinion is related to such mosquito lights.
You all know, you've got a definite population check in our mobile phone, you've sent somebody's information that you've given a fixed assessment, you can get it.
In those words, some people fool down on the treasure.
Technologies are spreading across a new world.
How technology is the biggest part of the economic structure, its misuse is increasing.
In order to relax the work, to get married, one day the person who lived in a house in his own house came, you have got a big compensation from abroad, if you want to reach it, you should pay 2 lakh rupees for the Shungth Direct.
This person sent a man who didn't know the name of his two lakh rupees, who had troubled his life without worrying about anything.
He loved a few moments to know that he was completely disappointed.
You're writing letters in a very miraculous way, you're gonna be supposed to be right.
Whoever makes a polybellector, can send it through, get your leather node, debit card number, etc., clean your bank account through technology.
It's a new kind of mosquito, it's digital mosquito.
I'd like to be awake, if such letters arrive, they'd be quickly aware of ourselves, friends, help them to be careful.
Shilpi Varma remembered it to me for a good time.
Such letters may have come to you, but you might haven't paid much attention to them.
But it's now the idea to pay attention.
I'm supposed to have the chances of meeting the people of the country when I'm going on in the clutches of the people, the parties of the country.
Our court members also come and meet the people in the respective segments, telling about your seats.
I had a pleasant experience when such a meeting.
Some students accompanied by Alicar met me.
The schoolgirl was dripping at the shore, they brought the biggest shit together, they were boiling joy in their faces.
Aligarh's official members came with them.
They brought the pictures that made the Aligarh railway station beautiful with you.
At the railway station there were artistic paintings.
Not only that, collecting plastic bottles or oil plastic bottles gathering in the skulls of the village, filling them with soil, pouring plants, vertical gardens.
They built a layered garden made of plastic bottles at the railway station and made a new shape for the station.
If you have the chance to go to Aligarh, you must go to the railway station.
These information related to many railway stations of India are the colors that have come to me now.
People associated with the localities enhance their local arts on the walls of the railway stations .
You can feel a new feeling.
It's an example of how people can make changes through participants.
My admirations to everyone in this kind of work in the country, especially my life for the slaves of Aligarh.
Our country also starts the season of many festivals with the rainy season in the people of the country.
Festivals are held in many places during the sweet season .
Festivals are held in temples and pilgrimages .
And you'll be busy in writing, in yourself.
Raksha Bandan's wedding is very important.
Like last year this year, during Rakshabandh, you cannot examine the Prime Minister's copies plan for the mothers and sisters of the country, or the Jewish Jody's copies plan.
Symptoms, brothers, put a check in your sister's really safe sense in life.
Why, in ourselves, cooking food, doing homework, maybe a woman we'll be sitting, or she'll be the daughter of some poor mother.
During this Rakshabandan festival, he can also review the Prime Minister's Safety Plan or Jewish Jody's copies plan, cannot he
It's the right meaning of self-social protection, is it yourself the Rakshabandan
My folks, we're born after we're freed from the country.
If the first Prime Minister to be born in independent India, it will be myself.
On the 8th day of August, the opening of white started.
It's seventy-five years since this campaign started leaving India, leaving India.
It's 70 years since the 15th day of August.
We're enjoying the smooth air of India.
I'm also with the great feeling of a free citizen.
But it's perfectly a memorable memorial that we've achieved these freedoms.
For 75 years, India became independent, and 70 years, all of us made a new obsession, a new lecture.
It can make a favour to do something made up for the country.
The sacrifices will snatch our eyes and minds of all.
The smooth sound of freedom on the four sides is once again swept away.
Let's make a climate of it.
It's not the state's program of freedom, it must be of the people of the country.
Like Dipawali, this morning we have to celebrate our festival.
I'd like to do something architecture with the idea of patriotism.
Definitely send this related smoking to narendramodiap.
Make a better environment in the country.
My folks, on the 15th of August, the bricket gets to me a trail from the people of the country.
It's a traditional event.
Maybe something you want to tell in your mind.
That's what you want to tell the people of the country.
I'll give you an invitation to talk to the bricket to the bricket.
That's your opinion, as a representative of yours, as the Prime Minister of the country.
Definitely send your suggestions to me, show new ideas.
I'm mixing your ideas with the people of the country.
I don't want to be the Prime Minister's opinion that the bricket should be pointed out.
There must be 125 crores of feelings indicating brickets.
Of course you tell me your feelings.
Mygov, if Narendra Modi acts.
Let's send him to Ello.
In today's time technology is very easy, you can send to me the most comfortable things.
Come on, fill us with memories of freedom fighters.
Let's go ahead with the minds of those great men who made full sacrifice for India, enjoy us, enjoy goodness for the country.
Nice lives, thanks.
