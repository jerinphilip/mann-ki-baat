The voice of the mind, the people of the country, the voice of October 2018.
It's our birthday on October 31.
This year, the youths of the country are terrifying in the drive.
Now the weather is like this.
So, I'm asking for a lot of giants to shore in the same drive.
Only six months before the country's independence, on 27 January 1947, the world famous international newspaper 'Dam', on its first side, confronted with the humour of Sardar Patel.
In the news of that dayline, the picture of India was also published.
But that picture isn't like it's still there.
In that picture India has been seen pieces.
It was more than 550 civilians.
The British were found to be in vain on India .
When they left the meeting, they thought India should be different pieces.
Dym newspapers had conveyed to India's negative threats like division, conflict, food habits, price rise and authority.
At the same time, coordinate the combination, and the papers that people can recover the wounds that have occurred in the mind and can only be done by the Clard Brahb.
The repetition of the life history of India's iron man was also taken by that article.
When there was a flood in Ahmedabad in the year 1920, he was depicted as he carried out the restricted activity as well as Bartholi satyagraha.
As far as the peasants, the workers were to have full faith in him till the first professionals.
Like the sword that runs through a mid-structure, the surveillance patel took every problem and solved it.
He made sure that all the cohesions in the country would be connected to India.
Even though Junagarh, Hyderabad, Scinchur are the colonies of Rajasthan, well, if we are able to see a comprehensive India, then it is also the main reason for the vision of distance.
India's Daily, we think we're gonna memorise our sympathy on our country, ourselves the Carthar Brahbye Pette.
This year, on 31 October, there's a lot more important.
The idol of the kingdom of the kingdom on that day will be the real honour of giving to Sardar Pate.
This statue built in the Narmada compound of Gujarat is two times high like the Mother Goddess of America .
This is the highest idol of the world.
The highest idol of the world is found to be built in India , every Indian will become very rich .
The real man of our soil, Sardar Patel, decorates our airplane.
I believe this idol of Indian mother embellishes every Indian .
Because the desire to see the idol of idols is natural to appear in every Indian's mind.
I'm sure that this idol is going to be a place to see people across the country.
My brothers and sisters, we all celebrated the day of 'Kalad'.
I'm heading everybody participating in the security forces of India.
I appreciate the families of our soldiers.
You need to know why we're celebrated every day for tomorrow.
The Indian soldiers took the rocks in Kashmir today and saved that valley from the skirmish of the storm.
This incident is also directly related to Sardar Brahbbhai Petal.
I read one of our valuable monsters, the old box of Sham Maneksha.
In that, Field Marshal Sham Maneksha, remembered the time he was pregnant.
At that time, monstrous activity began in Kashmir.
Feeld Marshal Maneksha has concluded how Sardar Brahbbai Petal had cut for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir.
He did not have any delays in sending the forces, and the problem should be resolved quickly, and the Cirdler Patel has given you clear instructions.
So, if our troops flew to Kashmir, we know how our Ranuva succeeded.
The memory of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi comes on 31 October.
I'm gonna give Indira Gandhi our honourable gift.
I'm the people of the country, who don't want to play.
Sports are very important in the world, mentality, strength, strength, body strength.
It's important to check the courage of the sportsmen.
These four documents are the bases of the country.
If we have these capabilities with our country's youth, our country will not only develop the economic and scientific technology but also explore the importance of the field of sports.
Two meetings that took place at the end were very pleasant for me.
The first meeting, the 2018-year-old change capabilities of the Asian sports comprising the warriors.
They won 72 complications and predicted the propaganda of the country by confronting new achievements.
I've got the pilgrimage to meet everybody differently.
I appreciate them, they'll be impatient to our people who have shown the temperament to gain victory over the barriers.
At the same time I got the unparalleled opportunity to meet the successful fighters in the summer game of 2018, which was held in Argentina.
You know that in the summer of 2018 boys, our youth's activity was so important.
In this competition, we got 13 complaints, and got three complaints in the twin sphere of confusion.
You must see that the activity of Indian soldiers in the Asian sports territories that took place at the end was very special.
You've always noticed that I've been shouting the word "definite or unforgettable" before.
This is an honest state of progress that reaches the sports sector of India everyday .
Apart from the field of sports, India has been inflicting new achievements in uneven sectors.
For example, I'd like to cut your valuable sports valor named Narayan Bhatur, who won the Asian sports sports of 2018 change capabilities.
He's a change powerful man in the world.
He lost his father when he was eight.
After that, eight years lived without the supporters.
After that, he was out of the house, cleaned the buses of Delhi Transport Corporation and lived on the roadside restaurants.
That's Narayan, international Magazine has won a fight in India's sermons.
Don't stand with it, you must also note what the Indian sports sector has earned the fastest importance.
And, India hasn't yet won the junior or Chinese species in Judeo.
But the young people have made historical achievements by winning the silver silver of India 's Tapabi Devi in the West .
Tapabi Devi is 16 years old and has joined a cavegram in Manipur.
Her father does a common businessman, a male fish business.
It's even a time to buy food.
In such a dry situation, his interest and devotion didn't deteriorate.
He created history by conquering victory for the country.
There's something like this.
Everybody's life, everybody, becomes the birthplace of incentives.
Young sportsmen's skirmish, immortal feelings are marked by the new India.
You know that we can successfully compete with the FIFA World Crown competition for 17 years of age, in the year 2017.
Appreciate that this competition was very successful.
FIFA has made a competitive competition for the 17-year-old world-class, in the field, in the number of people who have been discovered in time.
More than 12 lakh sports sports enthusiastics have discovered the fountain competitions in the sports playgrounds in different parts of the country and has given a great urge to young soldiers.
This year, we have the chance to run Halkeep competitions in Bhubaneswar, 2018.
The competitions of this World Crown Hawky are completed on 28 November, 16 December.
Every Indian, if he plays any game, or is interested in any game, is definitely interested in Hawkip.
In Hawky's game, India has made attempts to engrade golden letters.
With the conquest of India's accommodation, the world championship has also been won once.
India has made great high hawky fighters.
Hawky doesn't fulfil it, even if we ever observe about the game, without observing our authenticians.
The name of Major Diyan Chand , considered to be the Father of Haukhi , is famous all over the world .
And, Pulbir Singh Christian, Leslie Clitis Muhammad Shakith, Uttam Singh, is a long neat tradition of Indian Hawky till Dhanrajballa.
Nowadays, the warriors in the Indian dress, who look at your hard work and level, are shocked to the younger telephones.
It's a good opportunity for the sportsmen who want to see the most pretty competitors.
Go to Bhubaneswar, enjoy the Indian dress played there and every valor.
Besides Orissa state the most historical heritage , cultural heritage is also an important state .
That state people are all very foolish.
It's a wonderful opportunity to see Orissa players.
The world famous places here are Konark Sun Temple , Puri Jagannath Temple and Silka Lake etc . can also be seen .
I'm sure that 125 crores of Indian people have the support of them, as well as enjoying my lives to wear Indian singers in this competition.
I'm supposed to be living in this competition from different countries of the world.
My heart is really giving to the people of the country, to the people of society, to encourage and encourage the people of the country.
It is the best tradition of India .
At the same time, we still feel like this in every field.
But in the present new empire, the new leaders, the new methods, the Buddhist surveillance and enthusiasm.
I'll join the first festival of a new synthesis called "I" for the sake of affair.
My government plan, the country's information technology and artificial industry, the workers, and the purpose of encouraging social activity, have also begun to provide opportunities for their participation in this sector.
Their devotional feelings, the semen and the gathering of every Indian.
I don't know, we have created a new environment between the technology departments to promote society from different people.
Some people give speech to old people.
Some people dedicate themselves to pure work.
Some others help farmers.
But, after any activity, there is no internal illness, their sustainable power.
But a man who learns to sit in the chamber and play with a sword can help the sportsmen to dress up the chamber and wear the chamber of the chamber, change the sportsman.
This feeling, dedication is a functioning method.
It's making every Indian a great deal.
"It's not-- we're gonna be interested in all of us.
My brothers and sisters, while looking at your suggestions on the voice program of the mind today, Mr. Accumulated in the country.
Manish Magbhadra's commentary was very excited.
The geography of the people and their traditions and rituals has conveyed a headline in the voice program of the mind to assume the examples of natural environment .
He defines how the tradition of the tribes followed in our lives and understands what can be from the traditions of that kind .
Manish, I appreciate you to preserve this problem in the leaders of the voice program.
It's gonna be fond of us to know our miraculous past and round-the-clock traditions, if we hear new ways to follow the comprehensive lifestyle, especially the Western nations of environmental protection.
Our country is facing this problem.
But, in order to solve it, we need to know our traditional fats, especially our tribes, as well as remind us of the past.
Living closely with nature, singing is a consolidated part of our tribes.
Our tribal brothers, sisters, trees, vegetation and flowers are devoted to God.
In Madhya Pradesh , especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh , tribal people , Beepal and Arjun are worshipped .
Pishnoi classes living in the desert region of Rajasthan guide us to how to protect the environment.
Especially in the matter of protecting trees, they are ready to give life to you than a tree is affected.
The Mishmi tribe of Arunachal Pradesh is deserted with the nest of tigers .
They consider tigers as sisters of your own.
Tigers are wild shielder in Naukaland .
Warli tribes of Maharashtra consider tigers to be their residents.
They think tigers are with you, reflecting your wealth.
Cold tribes of central India , tigers believe that if they do not get food for tigers with their lives, they feel that the slaves of the slaves will also be hungry.
The people of Kondu tribe of Central India also stop fishing in the Kaitan river during the proclamation period .
This area is considered to be a fish sanctuary , they also think that due to this despair of land you will get rich fishes in large quantities .
At the same time tribes , people , strong , environmentally familiar with natural commodities , set up their dwellings.
In the Nilgiri mountain range of South India , the tribes living in some equivalent areas , set up their own villages only with the materials available in the area .
My brothers and sisters, the tribes are very peaceful and honest to live with respect.
Anyone feels that if you're harming your natural resources or creating it, fighting for your rights will not be persecuted.
I don't know that many tribes, tribes, who were the masters of our freedom fighters.
Nobody forgets Lord Birsa Munda who fought hard to fight the British ecosystem to protect your forest area.
Besides I'm still sustained, we can introduce genetics to how to live with nature.
In the country, the forest areas of the country, we have become very sufficient in our tribes to continue to remain forest areas.
They're gonna have to come before all of us expressing our feelings.
I'm the people of the country, in the "Mannth's voice" program, we've decided about the illustrious personalities and structures for the community.
But, these works are all gone, though, to show a new way to harm society, it's very deep in our thoughts.
A few days ago, we learnt about a farmer brother named Kurbachan Singh, who was in Panchape.
Kurbachan Singh's son is married to the farmer's brother who works hard.
Kurbhachen lion's plan has been demonstrated to the bridegroom's parents to run this marriage in a very easy way.
He also said that there is no need to spend a large population for marriage or any other matter.
He told me that it should be considered as a very ordinary virtue, suddenly abandoned a conclusion.
It's a simple concept that the woman's home doesn't finish such a situation, it's as hard as it is.
But, if Kurbachan lion asks for the rules, you'll be very surprised.
Ordinary farmer Kurbhachan Singh, the father of a woman, has a reflection of the true strength of our society.
She's a legal obligation to make sure she's putting her fruits on the ground and burning humiliation.
You need to see the social strength of this black.
The opinion of the lion assumed by Kurbachan could be very common.
But it takes how high his quality is.
By this we can realize how the rich families of our community solve their personal problems in a way of benefiting community .
The family members of Thirukar Kurbhachen Singh have taken us an example of that.
I read about the village named Kalarmajra near Naba of Punjab .
Instead of burning the pockets, Kalarmajra village has come to light by the administrators of the new technique of swallowing them with soil.
Praise me for Kurbachan Singh
I appreciate the people of Kallarmajra village, especially those who do not pour pollution in the surroundings.
You all come together with the real guides leading the Indian tradition of healthy lifestyle.
As small drops of water confluence, every creative activity must create good environment as the sea generates.
My folk people, our princes also take it:
In three locals, water, air, land, humidity, breath, medicine, vegetation, gardens, dreadful creatures, we have to calm down around us.
I have to calm down anywhere, every soul in yourself, every heart and this address.
Santi: Santi:
Wherever the world's peace wakes up, the name and particles of India are engraved by letters.
This year on 11 November is important for India .
Because, hundreds of years ago, the first World War ended on 11 November.
We realize that the war is over hundreds of years, the dwellers and human lives are over a hundred years.
The first world war for India is very important.
Actually, we don't have direct contact with that phone.
Well, our fighters have carried out the highest sacrifices in Anchor with cloth.
India's warriors have also taken the war that the Indians are not the victims of war.
Our warriors have shown their dress and valor in the worst regions of the worst season.
The only purpose was to make peace.
The world knows that there were great lives and museums during the first world time.
Only a million monsters and so many daddy people are reported to be dead.
That's why the world's atmosphere also realized the importance of peace.
The meaning of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
The peace today is not only war, but also the need of modern coordination, coordination to solve the terrorism, weather change, social change, economic development.
The evolving of perfect evil is gonna be the real example of peace.
I am the people of the country, our north-eastern states have special personality.
There is a mixture of the natural beauty of the north-eastern states .
Nowadays the states of north-east have been popular with your special activities .
The north-eastern system has seen a lot of progress in the natural fields.
In order to enhance the diet system, the state of Sikkim has been awarded a few days ago for the precious future policy of the year 2018.
The food and valuation structure of INA has given this gift.
This award for making the most important principle is linked to the Ascar award.
Besides, the recommendations received from 25 countries have been defeated by Sikkim.
For this, I appreciate the people of Sikkim.
I've been finished by the people of the country, October, and I can feel that there has been a lot of change in the weather.
With the start of winter, the season changes, the festival season begins.
On coming to Dandara, Dipawali, Baiya Tuj, Sath, it can be said that the month of November is the month of the festival .
The Indian people who celebrate these festivals give me life to everyone.
I'm asking you all to pay attention to your health.
Take care of your health, social interests.
I'm supposed to be the opposite of these kinds of conventions, new sure languages.
Your progress is very important for the development of the country.
If you grow up, this country will grow.
I'm sorry for all of you.
Thank you very much.
