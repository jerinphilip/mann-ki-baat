Prime Minister Mr.
Narendra Modi, on the 25th day of December 2016, at 11 a.m., says the Tamilnadu translation of the special exhibition conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population, is a namaskara for my dear countrymen.
You and Christmas have many good hopes.
Today's day is the opportunity to serve and sacrifice and compassion.
Jesus Christ said, "The poor are not our favorites, our recognition is."
Saint Luke Subvision says, "Yeshu's not only served poor but also congratulated the poor service.
'This is real hygiene.
A story related to this is very famous.
That story is like this.
Yeshu was standing near a temple shore.
Many of the rich came, they had a lot of donations in the Bhandara.
Then there was a poor widow.
They put two coins.
In a way, the snakes don't have much value.
It's natural to see the minds of the devotees from there.
Then Jesus said that whip was the greatest donation.
Because the others gave them a lot, but the widows gave them the highest.
Today is December 25.
Mahamana is the birthday of Madan Mohan Malviya.
Consciousness and self-confidence in the public opinion of India has been a new direction for modern education.
Her birthday's hearty honors.
Two days ago, I had the opportunity to start a lot of developmental activities in Banaras, Malaviyaji's Tapo ground.
I went to the Mahamana Madan Mohen Malaviya Cancer Care Center in Banaras Hindu University of Varanasi.
The cancer care center built there is not only in the north-eastern region but also for the people of Jharkhand Behar.
Today our former Prime Minister Bharat Ratna is the birthday of honorarium Bihari Vajpayee.
This country can never forget the contributions of Atalji.
Under his leadership, we took the nation's decision in the matter of conscience.
As a party leader, as a leader, as a minister and as prime minister, Atalji established great honor.
On the birthday of Atalji, I bless him and pray to God for his health.
I got an opportunity to work with Atalji as an acter.
Many memories are visible in the eye.
I've shared an old video when I published this morning.
You can see how I had the luck of the lover of Atalji for a small worker.
Today, Christmas is going to get the benefit of two schemes as Christmas prize.
In a way, the second date of November was started.
What are the castles between the country, the village, the educational, the illiterate, how cashless money can be done, the atmosphere of a kind of ambition has been created in all matters of how to buy things without Rupa's hand.
Everyone wants to learn and learn each other.
In order to promote this, to strengthen mobile banking, to become e-payment habits, the Indian government is launching programmes for consumers and small businessmen.
Lucky Grahk Yojan is a plan to promote consumers.
It's a plan to promote traders, the DG-Dhan business yojan.
As Christmas present on December 25, thirteen thousand people will get gifts through a bargain.
Thousands of rupees will be deposited in the account.
It's not only for a day, but it's going to start 100 days today.
Every day ten thousand people get a gift of thousand rupees.
For hundreds of days lakhs of families are being given millions of rupees.
When you use digital payment methods like mobile banking, e-banking, rupe card, UPI, USSD, you deserve gifts through hate.
And such consumers have a big shit once a week, in which the gift will be in lakhs.
And three months later, Dr.
The birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar will be bumpered on April 14, and there will be millions of gifts.
The DG-Dhan trade components are mainly meant by traders.
Merchants join themselves in this scheme and join the consumers to cashless their deals.
Such businessmen will give other priests.
These priests are thousands.
The traders will run their business and get the opportunity to get the gift.
This scheme is made in every section of the society, especially the poor and the middle class people.
So get such a gift for those who buy more than 50 rupees and less than 3000 rupees.
Those who buy more than Rs.30 don't get this gift.
Very poor people can buy feature phones with USSDs, even through normal phones, selling goods, closing money.
So they can be the beneficiaries of this plan.
In rural areas, people can do business with AEPS (Aadhaar Enabled Payment System), they can get gifts.
There are around 30 million Rupee cards in India, in which 20 million Jandhan accounts are on the day of poor families, so many wonder.
These 30 million people can soon be part of the present plan.
I believe people are interested in this plan.
I know if you ask them all the youngsters who know these things.
You'll have 10 and 12 children studying in your family, and they'll tell them well.
It's very simple.
It's simple as you're sending the Watts app messages through the mobile phone.
Dear people, how to use technology, how to do e-payment, the knowledge of online payments is very widespread in the country.
In the last few days, the cashless business, i.e., has increased 200-300 times.
The Indian government has taken a big decision to promote this.
This decision is as big as the businessman is guessing very well.
The businessman who gives digital payments gives the income tax to promote online payments instead of notice in his business.
I appreciate all the states and central jurisdiction of the country.
Everyone encouraged this movement in their own way.
Andhra Chief Minister Mr.
A committee has been made under the chairmanship of Chandrababu Naida.
The committee thinks about several plans related to this.
But the government has started several schemes in its own way.
Someone said that if the luggage and license fees were dispatched, it was decided by the Assam government to provide 10 percent of the liquidation.
If the branches of rural banks do at least two digital transactions between January and March with 75 percent of their dealers, then they get 50 thousand rupees from the government.
On 31 March 2017, 100 percent of the digital transmission villages have been declared as a gift of 5 lakh rupees according to the government's five-digital transmission plan.
They declared the farmers the digital cultivator Shiromani plan.
Accordingly, the first 10 farmers paying digital payments will pay 5000 rupees to buy seeds and curds.
In this case, along with appreciating the Assamese government, all governments appreciate the beginning of this kind.
Several organizations have deployed many successful methods of promoting digital deals between poor farmers in the village.
Someone said that GNFC - Gujarat , Narmadawali , Fertilisers and Chemicals limitted farmers had established thousand POS machines for the convenience of the workers and within a few days they had given 5 lakh grams of rice to the total thousand farmers through digital payments .
It's just happened in two weeks.
The most interesting thing is that in comparison to last year, 27 percent of GNFC's wages were sold.
Brothers, our economy and our lifestyle have great importance in the informal sector.
There's a lot of money for those working there.
The pay is payable.
It's known that the workers are being exploited.
It's 80 for a hundred rupees.
If you want 80, you get 50.
They don't get the benefits of healthcare, insurance, etc.
And then the cashless payment is directly deposited in the bank.
A kind of unauthorized turns out to be opposite.
It's finished.
The commission had to be given without it.
The workers, the peasants, have a position to get all the money like that.
And they get other benefits.
Our youths are more country.
Technically, we can neutralize.
A country like India should be the most advanced in this area.
Our youngsters have made a lot of progress in the startup.
This digital movement is a golden size.
With new ideas and new technology, this sector has to give greater importance to our youth.
So, we can be partners with all the power to salvage corruption from the country's conspiracy.
Dear people, I ask people at Manki Bay every month to share your opinions and tell you what you want to say.
Thousands of opinions this time MyGavl and Narendramodi Apple were about Rupa's revolt about 80-90 percent of the fight against corruption and conspiracy.
When I saw everything, I felt that the immigrants could be divided into a total of three.
Some have detailed that people have different kinds of problems and discomforts.
The other comrades wrote so good thing, for the good of the country, so sacred and the way all the lies are going on and finding what new ways of faith.
With the support of the three groups, they have written in a very strong language to carry out more stringent actions to continue this fight, to prevent corruption and conspiracy.
I am grateful to people to help me write so many letters.
Mr.
The gurumani Kewal wrote in My Gave: "This reflection to control the composition is commendable.
People have problems.
But we're fighting against corruption.
We are happy with our cooperation in this fight.
We fight as a military force against corruption and conspiracy.
The emotion of the Gurumani Kewal is emerging in all the corners of the country.
We're gonna recognize everything.
When people are suffering, when they are suffering, there are no people who are suffering from it.
I'm hurting you.
But for a glorious purpose, people are daring to gain this hardship and pain, when they work honourably to achieve a great goal.
These people are actually verses of change.
I thank people for not only tolerating people's sufferings, but to make people misunderstand.
How many legends spread
How many attempts have been made to color the volume for the fight against corruption and conspiracy.
Some people inspired Kingdanti, wrote a letter in the note, some said the price of salt, some inspired, the notes of 2000 will be withdrawn, 500 mines and 100.
But no one could eradicate people's minds between many kinds of legends.
Not only this, many of them came to Goda and made the thief light of those who possess their supremacy and their intelligence, and lighted the thiefs of the legends, in public.
I have hundreds of blessings for this ability of the people.
Dear people
I clearly know that if a hundred and twenty-five people stand together, then nothing is impossible and people are God's replica and people's blessings are God's blessings.
I thank people for participating in this great pride against corruption and conspiracy.
I would like to discuss extensive discussions about the political funding of the political parties, with the discussion about the fight against the Lok Sabha and the territory of corruption.
If the Church was held, it would have been a good discussion.
The legends that spread the princely parties say everything is free.
The law is the same for everyone.
Even if a person is an organisation, it's a political party. Everyone has to follow the law.
You'll have to follow.
Those who are not able to support the corruption and the plot, are trying all the time to find the shortages of the government.
The question was raised again because the laws were changing again.
This government is for ordinary people.
I'm constantly trying to know people's opinions.
What is the problem with the people, what law causes trouble, what can be solved.
See how many laws have to be changed by considering the comforts of the people as a government of eternal and sensitive time.
The goal is to reduce people's suffering.
On the other hand, I said it was an extraordinary fight on the 8th day.
How many powers have been mixed up in the treasury deals of faith and corruption for 70 years.
How much is their strength
When they decide to fight with such people, they're ignoring new ways to defeat the government.
The government has to adopt new methods to defeat those methods when they reflect new methods.
I'm gonna give you a 10- because the corrupt, the liars, the fugitives are decided to deprive the plot.
On the other hand, all kinds of liars are going on, and there are letters from many others who give information about how many new methods are found.
In this case, I wish the dear countrymen to congratulate heart.
You'll be seen in newspapers and TVs and reports that take new people every day.
How did all this happen
Let me tell you a secret.
The secret is that the information is giving people.
How much information is available in the government system, many times more information is available from the common people.
Sometimes it's going to be a success.
It's because the ordinary people wake up.
Can anybody imagine how dangerous the awakening people in my country challenge to bring such ill powers to light
Most of the information is available.
The government has set an e-mail address to provide such information.
Let's explain to it, Mi-Gav Lekuma.
The government is committed to fighting such robbers, fighting is easy if you have cooperation.
The third companion who writes letters is very much.
They say Modieji, don't be weak, don't stand, how hard it can be, it's gonna be at the end.
Thanks to those who wrote such letters.
Because there is faith in their letters, Ashervadad.
This isn't the end, I assure you it's just a beginning.
This war must win, there's no problem of weakening.
Hundreds of five tribes don't have the problem of refrain from the blessings of people.
In our country, the law was made in 1988 regarding the Benami wealth.
But never made any other laws related to it, not noticed, but kept in the ice sheet.
I took it out and made a strong 'Benami property law'.
In the coming days, the law begins to work.
Whatever is to be done for the nation, but it will be precautionary.
My dear people, I said in Man Kee Bay last year's recovery in the matter of farming our farmers between these sufferings.
It's a good solution for the agricultural sector.
The performance of the workers and the peasants and the youth of this country has been the best.
Last day, in the world economics, India has been very proud in many areas.
As a result of the continuous study of our people, India's high vision in Agol Ranking through different instruments.
India's rank is high in World Bank's Doing Business Report.
We are trying hard to make business practices in India equal to the Best Practices Agol method, and the success is coming.
According to the Agol deposit report released by DutchItha, India's position is third in the Top Prospective Host Economies For 2016-18.
India has buried 32 ranks in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
In Global Index 2016, we have moved 16.
World Bank's Logistics Performance Index has been raised 19 Ranks in 2016.
It's the same way that even if the other reports are assessed.
India is fast moving.
Dear countrymen, this time Lok Sabha-Rashtriya Sabha meetings are destructive of people's dishonour.
There was anger all around in the Church's affairs.
The President and the Vice-President have expressed disrespect.
But in this situation some good things are happening sometimes, the heart gets very happy.
In the midst of the circumvent of the Church, there was something that was unconcerned with the attention of the country.
Brother brothers, surgeon is a mission for the people of Divya.
I'm glad and glad to have gone to a Bill Church related to that.
I thank all the members of the world and the territory of the world, which shows gratitude to millions of divine people in the country.
The government is committed to the divine people.
I tried personally to speed up this move.
My goal was to get the right and glorify the people of Divya.
When we got four medals in Paralibiques, our divine brothers became strong for our effort and faith.
They raised not only the pride of the country, but also surprised the people of their own ability.
Our divine brothers and all the citizens of the country are our valuable wealth, power.
I am very satisfied that Divya will increase the opportunity to get jobs after the passage of this law for the good of the Divine people.
The government has increased the range of operations to 4 percent.
Through this rule, special departments have been made regarding the education of Divya, other facilities and complaints.
In the last two years, the government can guess how much the government has compassionate about the Divine, with four and a half threshold cremation grounds.
By spending Rs 352 crores, five lakhs of Divya distributed equipment to eighty thousand sisters.
The government has passed a new law with the wishes of the United Nations.
Earlier, Divangar was seven types of people.
Now it's made 21 types through the law.
14 new sections.
For the first time, the new segments that get the opportunity are included in it.
Thalassemia, Parkinson and leopards are also involved in this group.
My young friends
We've been proud of the news from the past few weeks.
It's natural for us to be proud as Indians.
Four priests have come to victory against the Indian cricket team England.
Some young players were congratulating in this.
