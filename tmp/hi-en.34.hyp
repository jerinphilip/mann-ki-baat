Talking to the mind, April 2016, my dear countrymen, greet you all.
Many programs make everyone in the holidays.
And in the holidays, the mango is seasoned, then it also minds that enjoy the mango and sometimes it also minds that if you get a chance to sleep in the afternoon, then it will be good.
But this time the fierce heat has radiated all the fun around.
Worried in the country is very natural and in it, when it is constantly dry, then the places of water and sanctuary are also reduced.
Sometimes due to encroachment, due to silting, the flow of water coming, due to obstructions, reservoirs also store very little water from their capacity and due to the order of the years, its collectability also decreases. .
Governments try their efforts to relieve the water crisis to deal with drought, but I have seen that citizens also make very good efforts.
Awareness is seen in many villages and what is the value of water, they know the same, who have suffered water problems.
And therefore, at such a place, there is also a sensitivity in relation to water and there is also activism of doing something.
A few days ago someone was telling me that the Hivare Bazar Gram Panchayat of Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra and the villagers there gave water a very sensitive village II .
addressed as sue.
Those who want to accumulate water get many villages, but they have changed the entire cropping pattern by talking to the farmers.
Such a crop, which used most of the water, whether sugarcane, banana, decided to leave such crops.
It seems very simple to hear, but it is not so simple.
How big will everyone have resolved to meet
You use a factory water, say, stop the factory because you take more water, then what will be the result, you know.
But this farmer brother, look, they thought that brother, sugarcane takes a lot of water, then leave sugarcane, they left.
And the whole of them went on such crops, which requires at least water.
They sprinkler, drop I
Drigation, Tapk Irrigation, Water Harvesting, Water Recharging - So many I
The village today stood on its strength to fight in front of the water crisis.
Well, I'll discuss a small village hivara market, but there will be many such villages.
I congratulate all such villagers for your best work.
Someone told me that Gorawa village panchayat in Dewas district in Madhya Pradesh.
The Panchayat launched a campaign to create arm pond by attempting.
Constructed around 27 arm ponds and due to that increased in the ground water level, the water came up.
Whenever the required crop of water got water and they used to tell thick accounts, their agricultural production increased by 20 percent.
Then water remains saved and when water water comes up, the quality of water also improves very much.
And in the world, it is said that pure drinking water becomes the cause of GP growth, it becomes healthy.
Sometimes it seems that when the Indian government reaches water from the railway, it becomes a news for the world.
It is true that the speed that Rifley works, he is eligible to congratulate, but he is equally eligible for congratulations.
I will say, there are more congratulations than that.
But many such schemes run by citizens, they never come out.
The good thing of the government sometimes comes out, but sometimes we will see in our neighborhood, then it will be in mind how people, new and new ways against drought, try to solve the problem.
There is a nature of man, how many problems go through, but if there is a good news from anywhere, then as the whole crisis is overcome, it is a hell.
Since the information became public that this time the rainfall is likely to be 106 percent to 110 percent, as if a message of great peace has come.
Right now it is time to come to rain, but the news of good rainfall also brought a new consciousness.
But my dear countrymen, there will be good rainfall, as much as the news gives, the same gives us an opportunity, challenges too.
Can we run a campaign nowadays to save the village-house water
Farmers need soil, they work as a crop in the field.
If we take the soil from the ponds of the village this time and take it to the fields, then the land of the farm will also be cured, then the strength of its water and irrigation will also increase.
Sometimes in the cement sack, sometimes in the empty sack of Certilier, stones and soil from where there are ways to water, can that water be stopped
Five days the water will stop, seven days the water will stop, then the water will go to the ground.
So the water level will come up in the ground.
Water will come in our wells.
The water that can be, should be stopped.
Rain water, village water will remain in the village, if we do something by making a resolution and it is possible with collective efforts.
So today is a crisis of water, it is a drought situation, but the coming month is the time of one and a half months and I always say, sometimes we go to Porbandar Mahatma Gandhi's birth place, so what we see there is different places, then in it it it is also like seeing what kind of tanks are two hundred and two hundred years old under the house and how clean the water was kept.
No Sriman Kumar Krishna, he wrote on MyGov and expressed curiosity in a way.
They say that what will happen to the campaign of cleaning the Ganga once in our lives
His concern is very natural, because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Many governments came, many schemes were made, there was a lot of expenditure and due to this, it is very natural to have this question in the mind of millions of people like Bhai Kumar Krishna.
For those who live in religious faith, Ganga Mokshadayini is for them.
But I will accept that memorable, but more than that I think that Ganga is this lifelong.
We get bread from the Ganges.
We get rosary from the Ganges.
Ganga gives us a new urge to live.
Ganga flows like this, gives a new pace to the economic activity of the country.
A Bhagirath brought us to the Ganges, but there is a need for millions of Bhagirathas to save.
Without public participation, this work can never be successful and therefore we all have to become a change agent for cleanliness, cleanliness.
It will have to repeat the matter again and again, it will have to say.
Many efforts are being made by the government.
Efforts are being made to take full support from those states which are on the Ganges coast.
Efforts are also being made to connect social, voluntary organizations.
Surface cleaning and I
Have taken a lot of steps to stop industrial pollution.
Every day, in large quantities in the Ganges, solid garbage flows through the drains and comes in.
Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna - In such places, trash skimmers work to clean garbage swimming in water.
All local bodies have been provided and they have been requested to run it continuously and clean the garbage from there.
And in the past, what I was told is that where big efforts are made, the garbage is taken daily from three tonnes to eleven tonnes.
So it is true that so much dirt is stopping from growing.
In the coming days, there is a plan to install a trash skimer in other places and its benefit will also be experienced immediately by the people of Ganga and Yamuna coast.
I
Pulp and Paper for controlling industrial pollution, distillery and sugar I
Action plan has become with Endustry.
Some volume has started to be implemented.
It will also have good results, I feel like this right now.
I am happy that I was told that Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, which was discharging the distillery, some officers were telling me that they have succeeded towards zero liquid discharge.
Pulp and Paper I
Endustry or Black Liquor evacuation is almost completely ending.
All these are indications that we are growing in the right direction and a awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that not just the banks of the Ganges, any person from far and wide south also gets, then surely says that the sahib, the Ganga will not be cleaned.
So this one who is the faith of the common man, will surely succeed in the Ganga Safai.
People are also giving donations for cleanliness of Ganga.
This system is being run well enough.
My dear countrymen, today is April 24.
In India it is celebrated as "Panchayati Raj Day".
Today, the Panchayati Raj system started in our country and today the Panchayati Raj system is working successfully as an important unit of our democratic royal system.
On April 14, Baba Saheb was celebrating Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary and today is celebrating "Panchayati Raj Day".
This was a pleasant coincidence, the great man who gave us the Constitution of India, from the 24th of the day, which is the strongest link of the Constitution, inspiration to connect both of our villages and hence the Government of India, with the cooperation of the State Governments, on April 14 to 24 April, 10 days launched Bharatoday campaign from Gramodaya.
It was my good fortune that on April 14, Baba Saheb Ambedkar ji's birthday got the opportunity to go to Mahu, the birthplace of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
That holy earth got an opportunity to bow down.
And today on 24th I am in Jharkhand, where our maximum tribal siblings live in that state, I am going to celebrate "Panchayati Raj Day" and at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and once again on "Panchayati Raj Day" I am going to talk to all the panchayats.
This campaign has worked as a great awareness.
How to strengthen democratic institutions at the level of the village in every corner of India
How to become the village self-reliant
How did the village plan its own development
I
Enrastructure is also important, social IV
The nrastructure is also important.
Do not drop in the village, do not leave the children school, "Beti Bachao Beti Teacho" campaign successfully runs.
The daughter's birthday should be the festival of the village, many such schemes, some villages have a food donation program.
Hardly, in such villages of India, so many diverse programs have been run for 10 days, it is very low.
I congratulate all the State Governments, the village heads for the fact that with a very fundamental method of innovation, this whole opportunity for the well-being of the village, for the development of the village, for the strengthening of democracy, changed in an opportunity.
The awareness that has come in the villages is the guarantee of Indo-Uday.
The basis of Indo-Uday is Gram-Uday and therefore we will continue to give all the strength on the village-Uday, then we will continue to achieve the desired results.
Sharmila Dharpure from Mumbai, you have expressed me concern over phone call: - "Prime Minister, Namaskar, I am speaking, Sharmila Dharpure, from Mumbai."
I have a question about you, school and college education.
The need for improvement has been found in the development sector for the last several years.
Not having adequate schools or colleges or lack of education in education.
It has been found that children also complete their education, they still do not know about basic things.
Our children fall behind in the race of the world.
What are your ideas about this and how do you want to improve this sector
Please tell us about this
Thank you
This concern is very natural.
Today, if every family has the first dream of parents, then it remains a good education of children.
The house-to-house is considered later and this feeling of public mind for a country like India is very strong.
Teaching children and teaching good.
Get good education, worry about it - it should increase further, more awareness should come.
And I believe, the families in which these awareness is also affected by the schools, teachers also come and the child becomes aware that I am going to school for this work.
And so, I will urge all parents, mother and father first to talk to the child by giving time in detail with the activities of the school.
And some things come to mind, then go to school and talk to the teachers.
This is the vigilance, it can also reduce many evils in our education system and it is to be done by public participation.
All governments in our country have stressed on education and every government has also made efforts in its own way.
And it is also true that for a long time, we have been focusing on the educational institutions standing, expanding education system, becoming school, collages, recruitment of teachers, maximum children come to school.
So, in a way, efforts to spread education around, it was preferred and necessary, but now the importance of expansion is more important than our education.
We have done a great deal of expansion.
Now we have to occupy, uality education.
Now good education from literacy campaign, it will have to make our priority.
So far the account was outlay, now we have to occupy only on the outcome.
So far, how many people came to school, there was force on it, now we have to emphasize more learning than scooling.
Enrolment, Enrollment, Enrollment - These mantras have been continuously echoing, but now, the children who have reached the school, we have to focus on good education, qualified education.
You must have seen the current government budget too.
Efforts are being made to emphasize good education.
It is true that it is a long journey.
But if we decide the hundred and fifty million people, then a long journey can also be cut.
But Sharmila ji's point is true that we need to improve radically.
This time in the budget you must have seen that work has been done away from leak.
Under the budget, ten government niversity and ten private niversity - To give them freedom from government bonds and to come to the Challenge route, let's say, what do you want to become topmost citizenship
This plan has been kept with the intention of giving them an open exemption.
India's niversites can also become global competition niversity, should also be created.
Along with this, the importance of education is as much as skill, in the same way, technology will play a big role in education.
Cong Distance Ducation, Technology - It will simplify our education and it will see its results in the very near future, I believe it.
For a long time people keep asking me on a subject, some people write on Web portal MyGov, some people write me on Narendra ModiApp, and most of these young people write.
"Prime Minister Jee Namaskar
I'm speaking Mona Karnawal, from Bijnor.
In today's era, studies for youth as well as sports are also of great importance.
They should also have a feeling of Team spirit and there should be properties of being a good leader, so that they have overall hospital development.
I'm saying this to my experience, because I've lived myself in Bharat Scouts and Guides and it has a very good effect in my life.
I want you to motivate more young people.
I want the government to promote more than N, NSS and Bharat Scouts and Guides.
You people used to send me so many suggestions, so one day I also felt that I should talk to you before that I would talk to these most.
So you were the pressure of the people, you were the suggestions of the people, the result was that I called such a meeting now, in which NEE was the head, was from NSS, Scout and Guide, Red Ross Was from the Youth Center.
And when I asked them when they met first, they said, no brother, we have been the first meeting of this kind after the country was free.
So, first of all, I congratulate those young friends who put pressure on me in relation to all these works.
And the result of that is that I met and I felt good that I met.
I needed a lot of co-ordination.
There is a lot of happening in your own way, but if collectively, organized, our different types of organizations work, how big can they give.
And how big is their spread, how many families have they reached.
So seeing them, I got a big solution.
And their excitement was too much, there was something to do.
And it is true that I am myself Aadet of N, so I know that such organizations get a new vision, get inspiration, a national perspective flourishes.
So I have got the benefit in my childhood and I also believe that a new life should be filled in these organizations, new power should be filled.
This time I have kept something in front of them.
I have told them that brother, why do not our youth, all the organizations do great work of water and irrigation in this season.
How many blocks, how many districts, can we stop defecating in the open by trying.
How can the pen defection ree
What kind of work can be done to connect the country, what can be the common young song of all organizations
Many things have happened with them.
I urge you today, tell me too, tell me a lot of perfect suggestions that many of our youth organizations run.
Can you add new things to their style of functioning
If you write on my NarendramodiApp, then I will reach the right place and I believe that after this meeting there will be a lot of speed in them, so I feel like this and you will also mind joining him, such a situation will be made.
My dear countrymen, today we all have to work hard to think.
I also see it as a shocking thing to the people.
You must have seen that the political state of our country is such that in the last several elections, it was discussed which party would give cylinder of gas
12 cylinder that 9 cylinder
This was a big issue of election.
And every political party felt that middle class society had to reach elections in terms of elections, then Gas Cylinder a very big
sue is.
On the other hand, economists were pressurized to reduce subsidy and due to which many committees used to sit, in which huge proposals came when reducing the subsidy of gas came.
There were crores of rupees spent behind these committees.
But the thing was left there there.
This experience is everyone.
But never thought out of it.
Today, my countrymen, all of you, enjoy me that I chose the third path and that path was to trust the people and the people.
Sometimes we should trust politicians more than themselves.
I had said in such things by relying on public-generation that if you can tolerate the burden of fifteen hundred, two thousand rupees a year, then why do not you leave Gas Subsidy, any poor work will be done.
That's how I spoke, but today I can say with great pride, I am despised to my countrymen.
One crore families voluntarily surrendered their gas subsidy.
And these 10 million families are not rich.
I see, no retired teacher, retired work, no farmer, no small shopper - such middle class, low middle class families, who left.
See the second feature that subsidy could have been able to app the mobile phone, Conline could have done missed calls on the telephone, there were many ways.
But, when it was calculated, it was discovered that more than 80 per cent of these families were those who themselves went to the distributor, stood in the queue and in writing they surrendered their subsidiary.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government gives a little concession in one ta, gives exemption, then the applause of that government is heard in TV and newspapers throughout the week.
One-and-a-half families left subsidy and subsidy in our country has become a kind of right, left it.
I first bow down to hundreds of families, greet them.
because they have forced politicians to think in a new way
This incident has forced the economists of the country to think in a new way.
And if this is the meaning of the world, then it will be done, then it will come out, thus for those who make economic equations, this is the incident outside their thinking limitations.
Sometimes you have to think about it.
Leaving subsidy of one crore families, in return, millions of poor families get gas cylinders.
Saving of rupees from leaving the subsidy of one crore families, these are very common from the outside point of view.
The unusual thing is that if you work by trusting the public, then how big is the achievement.
I would like to insist the entire political class of Khaskar today that we must do one thing that trusts the people everywhere.
You will never have thought, we will get the result.
And we should go in this direction.
And I just think I think it ' s a square I of 3 and 4 .
Why do nterview Bhai
Trust him who is sending his eam and sending his marks.
Sometimes I feel like we should ever declare that there will be no ticket chef in the railway's route today.
If you see, we trust the people of the country.
Many can use.
Once we trust the people of the country, we can get the immense results.
Well, these are the ideas of my mind, no government can make it rules, but the atmosphere can be created.
And this environment is not making any politician.
One crore families of the country have made it.
A gentleman has written a letter to me by Ravi - Good news everyday. They are writing that please tell your officials that every day Post about a good event
Every newspaper and news channel has every breaking news, bad news
Is there anything good around us in a country with a hundred million population
Please change this condition.
Ravi ji has expressed great anger.
But I believe that perhaps they are not angry at me, they are angry at the situation.
You will remember, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, former President of India always used to say that print only positive news on the first page of the newspaper.
They used to constantly say this.
A few days ago, a newspaper also wrote to me.
They said that we have decided that on Monday we will not give a new news, positive news.
These days I've seen, some T.Channel Positives are scheduled to schedule the time.
So it's true that these days the atmosphere has now become positive news.
And everyone feels that the right news, keep getting good news to the people.
One thing is true that the bigger person also tells the best things, tell them in good words, tell them in a good way, more than what is the effect, it has a good news.
Good news is the biggest reason for inspiration.
So it is true that as much as we emphasize goodness, then there will be less space for evils in ourselves.
If you burn the given, then the darkness will be sorted - it will be sorted.
And so you might know, the government is running a website Transorming I
There are positive news on this.
And not just the government, it is also the public and it is such a portal that you too have a good news, then you can send it.
You can also contribute it.
Good suggestion Ravi ji has given you, but please do not anger me.
All of us try to do positive, try to speak positive, try to reach positive.
The specialty of our country is - Kumbh Mela.
Kumbh Mela can also be the center of attraction of tourism.
Very few people in the world know that for so long millions of people came on the banks of the river.
Opportunities are concluded in peaceful peaceful environment.
These incidents are going to prove a very big standard in terms of public participation in terms of organisation, in terms of event management.
For the last two days, I'm seeing that many people are uploading pictures of Simhastha Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the state government to compete it, and to the people say that you take out the best photo and upload you.
How will an atmosphere be created and people will also know how many diversity things are going on in every corner of Kumbh Mela.
So sure it can be done.
Look, this is right.
I met the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh in the middle, he was telling us that we have given special emphasis on cleanliness and cleanliness is there, not so, people should also take a message of cleanliness from there.
I believe this "Kumbha Mela" is a religious-spiritual fair, but we can make it a social opportunity too.
Can also create an opportunity for rites.
There can also be a reason for reaching the village with good resolutions, good habits.
How do we increase love for water from Kumbh Mela, how to increase faith in water, how to use this "Kumbh Mela" in giving message of water and irrigation, we should do it.
On this important day of my dear countrymen, Panchayat-Raj, in the evening, I will meet you once again, thank you very much for all.
And like Har-Hamesh, your mind has added an unbreakable relationship with my mind, I am happy about it.
Then thank you very much once.
