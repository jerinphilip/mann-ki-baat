Talk about the mind, December 2017 My dear countrymen, Namaskar
"This is the last program of this year and coincidence that today is the last day of the year 2017"
We and you shared a lot of things this year .
"This exchange of all your letters, comments, ideas, for me, always comes with a new energy"
After a few hours, the year will change but this series of our talk will continue in the same way
In the coming year, we will do new things, share new experiences
You all have many best wishes for 2018 .
Christmas Festival was celebrated worldwide on 25 December last days .
Even in India , people celebrated this festival with great enthusiasm .
On the occasion of Christmas, we all remember the great teachings of Jesus Christ and the most emphasised Jesus Christ was - "Service"
We also see the essence of service in the Bible
The Son of Man has come, not to served, but served, and to give his life, as blessing To All Chumankind. It shows what is the importance of service
There will be any caste in the world, religion, tradition, color, but service, it is as a precious identity of human values.
In our country there is a "decisive action", that is, a service in which there is no expectation"
We have been told here , Service Paramo Dharma :
Shiva - Seva and Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramahansa used to say Jiva-serving with Shiva - Bhava i . . all these are equal human values throughout the world .
Come, remembering the great men, remembering the holy days, give this great value tradition, give new consciousness, give new energy and also try to live it
My dear countrymen, this year was also the year of 350th light festival of Guru Gobind Singh ji
An extraordinary life full of courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh is the source of inspiration for all of us .
Guru Gobind Singh preached the great values of life and on the basis of these values he lived his life .
A guru, poet, philosopher, great warrior, Guru Govind Singh ji worked to motivate people in all these roles
They fought against harassment and injustice .
taught people to break the bonds of caste and religion .
In these attempts , he had to personally lose a lot .
But they never gave place to the feeling of malice .
In every place of life the message of love , sacrifice and peace - how many great characteristics was his personality .
It was fortunate for me that at the beginning of this year I joined the publication held at Patnasahib on the occasion of Guru Gobind Singh Ji 350th Jayanti .
Come, take all the resolutions and try to mould life while learning from Gurugovind Singh's great education and his inspirational life
January 1, 2018 i.e. tomorrow, tomorrow is a special day in my view
You might also be surprised, the new year comes, even one January comes every year, but when I talk about special, I really say that is special

My dear countrymen, in the last "mind" I talked to you about the importance of positive"
I remember a version of Sanskrit "Assaho Balwanarya, Nastyutsahat Param Balam"
Satsahasya Cha Lokeshu , Kinchidaphi , Rarlabham
This means, a person full of enthusiasm is very powerful because nothing is more than enthusiasm
Nothing impossible for a person full of positive and enthusiasm
People in English also say "Pessimism leaders to wakeness, optimism to power"
I had appealed to the countrymen in the last month to share their positive moments of 2017 and welcome 2018 in a positive atmosphere
I am very happy that a large number of people gave social media platform, MyGov and narendramodi app very positive responses, shared their experiences
Positive I
Millions of tweets were made with India Hashtag which reached more than one and a half crore people .
In a way the communication of positive, starting from India, is the world over
The tweets and response that came were really inspiring
It was a pleasant experience .
Some countrymen shared the developments of this year which had a special effect on their mind, had positive effects.
Some people also shared their personal achievements .

I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket-One, Faiz One, Delhi

We cut a month's cut, that insurance was done by my husband

With this help of the Government , we benefited a little bit from him , my name is Santosh Jadhav .

Come, with these small happiness we enter the new year, start the new year and positive I
Progressive ID from Endia

When we all talk about positive , I also want to share one thing
Recently I came to know about the inspirational story of Kashmir ' s administrative service topper Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak .
He has come out of the bite of terrorism and hatred to the examination of Kashmir Administrative Service .
You will be surprised to know that in 1990 terrorists burnt their ancestral house
There terrorism and violence were so much that their family had to leave their ancestral land .
For a small child, the atmosphere of such violence around him, was enough to create darkness and bitterness in the heart - but Anjum did not let this happen
He never left hope .
He chose a different way for himself - the way to serve the people .
He came out of the opposite situation and wrote his own story of success .
Today he has become an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but for the youth of the whole country .
Anjum has proved that the clouds of despair can also be demolished by positive actions, how bad the situation is not
Just last week I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir .
The enthusiasm that was in them, the dreams that were dreaming and when I was listening to them, how do they want to progress in the field in life
And they were so hopeful .
I talked to them, there was no despair of disappointment - there was enthusiasm, there was energy, dreams, resolution
From those daughters, as long as I spent, I got inspiration and this is the strength of the country, these are my youth, these are the future of my country
My dear countrymen, not only our country, whenever the famous religious places of the world are discussed, it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala.
In this world famous temple devotees come here every year to take the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami .
Where such a large number of pilgrims come, the place where such a great significance is there can be a big challenge to maintain cleanliness
And especially in the place that is located between hills and forests
But how can this problem be changed in rituals, how can the way to recover from the problem and what is so much in public participation - this Sabarimala temple itself is an example
A police officer named P.Vijayan started "Punyam Poonkavanam", a program and under that program, started a voluntary-campaign of awareness for cleanliness"
And made such a tradition that the journey of the passengers who come, they do not complete until they do any physical labor in the cleanliness program .
There is no bigger , no smaller in this campaign
Every traveler understands the part of God's worship and does some time for cleanliness, works, works to remove dirt
Every morning the scene of cleanliness is very amazing and all pilgrims get together in it .
Why not be a big celebration, why not a rich person, how big it is, everybody becomes part of this "Punyam Poonkavanam" program as a common traveler, only after cleaning
We have many such examples for the countrymen .
This sanitation campaign so far in Sabarimala and in it "Punyam Poonkavanam", it becomes part of the journey of every passenger."
There along with rigorous fast , the harsh plan of cleanliness also goes along .
My dear countrymen, on October 2, 2014, on the birth of Pooja Bapu, we all have resolved that the incomplete work of worshipping Bapu is i.e. "Clean India, "Free-India"
Pooja Bapu struggled for this work throughout his life, continued to try
And we all decided that when worship is the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we should do something towards giving them their dreams to India, "Clean India"
Efforts are being made at a broader level across the country towards cleanliness
Changes in rural and urban areas have also started appearing from wide public participation .
The world ' s largest survey " Clean Survey 2018 " will be conducted between January 4 and March 10 , 2018 to assess the level of cleanliness in urban areas .
These surveys will be done in more than four thousand cities in approximately 40 million population .
The facts that will be assessed in this survey include liberation from open defecation in cities, garbage collection, transportation arrangements for lifting garbage, efforts being made for behavioral change, innovative efforts made for capacity building and cleanliness and public participation for this work
During this survey, different parties will go to the inspection of cities
Talk to the citizens and react to them
Analysis will be done for the use of cleanliness app and improvement in various types of services .
It will also be seen whether all such arrangements have been made by cities that make the cleanliness of the city a nature of a people, become the nature of the city.
Cleanliness, not just the government
Every citizen and citizen organisation is also very responsible .
And I appeal to every citizen to take part in the cleanliness-surveillance that is going to happen in the coming days
And don't stay behind your city, don't stay behind your street - take the lead
I am sure that the use of blue and green dustbin separately, dry and wet and garbage from home, now your habit has become
The theory of reduce, re-use and recycles is very important for the garbage.
When the ranking of cities will be done on the basis of this survey - If your city belongs to more than one lakh people, then there is less than one lakh population in the ranking of the whole country, then get higher space in regional ranking, it should be your dream, your effort should be done
In the cleanliness-surveillance between January 4 and March 10, 2018, you should not go backward anywhere in this healthy competition of cleanliness - it should become a subject of public discussion in every city
And you should dream of all, "Our city- our effort, progress of our progress country"
Come, with this resolution, all of us once again recall the worship of Bapu and take the resolution of Swachh Bharat and do the culmination of Purushartha
My dear countrymen, there are some things that look very small in appearance but as a society keep affecting our identity far and wide
Today , through this programme of the mind , I want to share one such thing with you .
One thing came in our knowledge that if a Muslim woman wants to go for Haj pilgrimage, she can not go without her male guardian
When I heard about it for the first time, I thought how could this happen
Who will make such rules
Why this discrimination
And when I went into his depth , I was surprised - even after seventy years of independence , we were the people who replaced it .
There was injustice to Muslim women for decades but there was no discussion .
Even in many Islamic countries this rule is not .
But Muslim women in India did not have this right .
And I am glad our government paid attention to this .
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs also took necessary steps and we removed this restraction by destroying the tradition of seventy years .
Today, Muslim women can go to Hajj without 'Maharam' and I am happy that this time about thirteen hundred (1300) Muslim women have applied to Hajj without 'Maharam' and from different parts of the country - from Kerala to the north, women have expressed their desire to do Haj pilgrimage.
I have suggested to the Ministry of Minority Affairs to ensure that all such women are allowed to go to Hajj alone .
Generally there is lottery system for Haj pilgrims but I would like that alone women should be kept out of this lottery system and they should be given opportunity in special category .
I say with full confidence and it is my firm belief that India's development journey, on the strength of our womenpower, has gone ahead with the trust of their talent and will continue to grow
Our constant effort should be that our women also get equal rights equal to men, get equal opportunities so that they can move forward on the path of progress simultaneously
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic festival for us
But this year 26 January 2018 will be remembered, especially
This year leaders of all ten ASEAN countries will come to India as chief guests for the Republic Day celebrations .
This time on Republic Day, not "one", but "The" (10) will be the chief guest."
This has never happened before in the history of India .
2017, ASEAN (ASAN) country and India are looking forward to both
ASEAN (ASAN) completed its 50 years in 2017 and 25 years of India's partnership with ASEAN (ASAN) in 2017 have also been completed.
It is a matter of pride for all the Indians to join these great leaders of the 10 countries of the world on 26th January .
Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals
Our country is in a way a country of festivals .
There is hardly a day which has not been mentioned .
Now we all have celebrated Christmas and the next new year is going to come
The next new year came for all of you with happiness, happiness and prosperity .
All of us move forward with new enthusiasm, new enthusiasm and new resolution, proceed to the country too
The month of January is the period of sunrise and in this month Makar Sankranti is celebrated .
This is the festival associated with nature .
Although our every festival is connected to nature in some form but in our culture full of diversity , this wonderful event of nature is also the practice of celebrating in different forms .
If there is enjoyment of Lohri in Punjab and North India then waiting for Khichdi and Til Sankranti in U . . . Bihar remains .
Say Sankranti in Rajasthan , Magha-Bihu in Assam or Pongal in Tamil Nadu - All these festivals are special in itself and they have their own importance .
All these festivals are usually celebrated between 13 and 17 January .
The names of all these festivals are different, but their origin is the same - connectivity with nature and agriculture
All the people of the country have very good wishes of these festivals .
Once again greet all of you for the new year 2018 .
Thank you very dear countrymen
Now talk again in 2018
Thank you
.
