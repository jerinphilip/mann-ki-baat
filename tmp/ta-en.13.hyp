Folks, call me Manki Bath, January 2018.
This is my first voice for 2018.
Two days ago, we celebrated our presidential trinity with great enthusiasm, for the first time in history, the leaders of ten countries joined this conference.
My folks, Pragash Tribadi, have written a long letter in the Narender Mody Activity, asking me very much about all the things I have to talk about.
On the 1st day of February, Kalpana Sawla disappeared every day.
Because of the colombia space disaster, they're not with us today, they've been enjoying the youth of all over the world.
In such a way, Kalpana Sawla, who disappeared everyday, told me about my gratitude for the introduction of her letter.
Calpana Sawla, at such a young age, has left the message of ourselves to be very sorry, but they are not limited to thousands of women in India, especially in the whole world.
Her life shows us that if loyalty and powerful determination, the thirst of royalty is not something.
Today, women in India, come forward very much in every field, come to a position of the country's glory.
In our country, the honor of women in our country, the importance of their community, their partitions, etc. have come deeply in surprise.
There is only a tradition called the best women in education in India .
Several educated women have been participants in the creation of vague surroundings.
Lopmutra, Corkey, talk about the Mythroi surveillance, we're telling women children to live today, but many years ago, our weapons in Kandpurana, , , , , ON ON ON ON ONDSABUTRAN, Samania , DSABUTRAN BREVATION.
Yeah, Labdeemerthya, The Labye Kanyakaya.
That's what you said.
I mean, like a daughter, ten sons.
How many fools can be found by ten sons, they're all like a foolish fool.
It speaks about the importance given to women in our community.
That's why you've given yourself power to women in our community
This male-power connects the nation with the whole and the whole of society, the whole of the family, the unity.
It gives us an excellent excitement of the epic Lopa Mutra, Corkey, Maitrey's scriptures, Aka Mahadevi, Meerabai like knowledge, devotion, Ahilya Bai Holkar's grace, Rani Laxmiba's heroes, and women's powers, which have brought us the importance of the country's ambition.
Prakash Tribadi has given them many more examples.
Our Secretary of Security, Nirmala Sitharaman, who had sucked the air in Sukoy 30, indicates that the women team of the Indian Turkish head of Vartika Joshy in the INSV TARINI glass has been traveling the world.
Poona Khand, Mokena Singh, Avani squarewegi, three foolish women are foolish ships, who are coming in the process of running Sukoy 30.
The women's team, headed by Kshamada Wazbei, went to San Francisco from Delhi to Delhi, flying back to Ear India Boying Jet, all of them are our women.
He has written all these in his letters.
You're absolutely right to say.
Today, women come not only to come forward in all the fields but also to head.
Today, in many areas, women's power is the first to understand, a milligram has been established.
In the past, the President of Methaku has taken a new lead.
In Dutch areas, we met a team of unusual women who were first adventured.
In every area, the first royal women of the country, the first female captain of the ships, the first female driver of the train, the first female driver, the first female bus driver, the first woman who reached Antarctica, the first woman touched the Everest peak - our women and the strength of the society have been designed to identify and unprecedented achievements.
With the help of hard work, endeavour, psychological forces, all the restrictions, spaces, and a new way can be made.
On this way they are not only the citizens of their time but also offering enjoyment to the leaders of choice.
They're filling up new joys, new joys.
The whole country should be aware of these women's powers, and this woman's advisors have also written a book about the women who have come first to learn through their lives.
This book is found in the e-book form today in the Narendramodi app.
Today the importance of women 's energy in the formative changes that have occurred in the country and society is increasing .
Today, if we're talking about women's rights, I'd like to convince about a railway station.
You can imagine what can be between a railway station, women's authority.
All the workers of Madunga railway station of Mumbai are women .
Women in all the fields - they are territorial , trained , travel routine testimony , knowledgeable persons , communicable persons , all 40 working women themselves .
This time, after seeing the royal festival, in Diver and other social networks, many important matters, the bicycling section of the border guards, all the women in this team are present.
They were understanding the illusions, the miracles, the residents who came from abroad, were surprised.
A form of power, self-sacrifice.
Today our female power is headed.
Absolutely appears.
I am careful about the amazing work of our tribal women of Satiskar.
They're giving a new leaf.
When talking about tribals, there is a definite view in everyone's mind.
There are jungles in this sight, roads, in which the women who hung their heads.
But our tribal women of Satiskar, our women's strength, have made a new vision before the country.
The Dandevada region of Satishkar is a part of Maoist violence .
Maoists here are creating a terrible environment of conflicts, contradictions, guns, gardens.
In a terrible environment, tribal women, rickshaws running in petrochemicals, come to be self-sacrifice.
Besides, many women love to join themselves.
From this, three spirits - on one side self-confidence has given them authority, on the other hand, the vision of a region surrounded by mavity principles changes.
Besides, environmental relations are also strengthened.
I'm appreciating the government administration here, they're supposed to be the most important participant after the success of these women until they're the first to provide financial assistance.
We've been listening to the word "I don't know anybody can destroy us."
So if it's special, it's the kind of tightness, transformation.
Getting off the observation, supposing changes in the required.
It's the specialty of our society, our cultural secrecy, the tradition of ourselves to improve itself.
It's the principle that will improve yourself, the symbol of the society of pushing.
There have been continuous efforts in the country for centuries against social reforms, disruptions and social levels.
A few days ago, a tasty advance was taken in Bihar.
The social reforms are more than 13,000 in Bihar state.
A human assault program was arranged at a distance of miles.
Through this drive, awareness was encouraged against the evils like the child's marriage, obligation.
The States have decided to fight all against obligation and child marriage.
Children, elders, gentlemen, gentlemen, young men, mothers, sisters all together before themselves.
Starting in the historical Gandhi Maidan of Patna, this man's slave has long been connected to the border of the state, not only to stay.
If all the levels of society do not have the benefits of thrilling progress, then our community should be freed from these circumstances.
We're gonna have a chance that we're gonna get rid of the equations of ourselves
Come to create a new India, powerful, valuable India.
I'm demonstrating my appreciation to all the people of Bihar, the princes of the state, the administration of its administration, and all of them participating in mankind, they have made a special, extensive advance for social welfare.
My folk people, Karnataka's Mysore philosophy, have written what they have written in MyGov . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He describes that I should talk about this in the voice program of my mind, through which most people want to know about it, and they also want to benefit.
For the past few years, people are coming to me to write letters about this matter.
I've seen a lot of fascinations and social publicity regarding the followers through this program.
It's very pleased to see such information.
A deep fulfilment.
The Darshan got them, I'm glad he got up in the mind that he thought he should get the others.
The objective behind this project is to make the fitness of the fitness service , to make life easy .
In comparison to medicines available in medicines , traded medicines it is 50 percent less than 90 percent .
In this, simple people, especially daily medicines, provide economic benefits to adults, which increase the consumption.
Generic medicines to be bought here, that is, the same type of medicines are provided to the standards of the World Health Organization.
Due to this reason good quality medicines are available in cheap prices .
Today more than 3000 people have been established by the Central Government of India .
Through this the medicines are available in the swimming season and the industrialists have also made a new opportunity for the work of different people .
Excellent medicines, Prime Minister Bhartiya people are available in medicines, hospital hospitals.
Besides this , the only objective behind this is to make the most poor people living in the country healthy and controlled services , through which a healthy , rich India can be absorbed .
My folks, Mangesh Vehicle, affiliated to Maharashtra, are surpassing a treasure in the Narendramodi Mobile App.
That smoke was very attractive to me.
One of them had participated in the process of purifying the Morna river , connecting with their grandfather .
The citizens of Akola have done the process of purifying the Morna river in relation to this pure India movement.
The Morna river has become a river flowing for 12 months, but now it has turned into a seasonal state.
Another thing that is pitying here is full of wild boars and waterfalls on the river.
On the banks of the river swellings of marvellous pools .
A program was made to see this , one day before Makar Sankaranti , on the 13th day of the month of January , 4th year of the Morna river sanctuary program .
Me.
In 14 places of length both the shores of the river were cleaned .
More than 6,000 civilians of Akola participated in this 'Morna River Sanitation Programme ' , many centuries of their own throne institutions , colleges , students , children , elders , mothers and sisters .
I have been told that this pure drive was started on 20th January, 20th January, and till Morna river was completely clean, this drive continues every Saturday morning.
If a man decides to be ready, he doesn't show that he can't slave.
You can make big changes through people's movement.
I'm supposed to appreciate my efforts for all the Akola people, its district and municipal administration, the people participating in public activity, and your efforts will predict other citizens of the country.
My folks are discussing the words of the Padma awards given to the President of the Honor.
Messengers and TVs are attracted to it.
But when you see the leprosy, it's great for you.
There are specialists among us, without any reference to them, the awards and privileges are very rich in ours.
The tradition of Padma awards every year remains among us , but in the last three years it has changed its artificial activity.
Any drunkard can recommend anybody.
This whole activity takes place in the way of the online, the light is delicate.
In a way, there has been a complete change in the method of trading these battalionists.
You might have noticed the very simple man getting Padma awards.
Generally, Padma awards are available for not being seen much in cities, news reports, TVs and fairs.
Now it's not necessary that a person should be precious, but his actions are marked by him.
Kanpur i.
I.
You may be happy to know that Aurvind Gupta, who was chosen by television, enjoyed all his life in making sports for children.
He's been making sports from the hut for 40 years, which means he acts as a scientific interest for the children.
He's been trying to see the scientific tests done by unsuccessful things.
For this, he goes to 3000 schools across the country, encouraging the pictures made in 18 languages.
What a wonderful life, look at your miracle
Their lives of the Sethavwa Jodti of Karnataka state are similar.
It doesn't matter in calling him that the wife is occupied by Goddess.
For the past 30 years, they have been interested in changing the life of unemployed women.
Since his 7th year, he dedicated himself to God, for the sake of God's life.
Not only this, they have always been involved in the news for the health of the women who have fallen down.
You might have questioned them about the Buzzoo Shyam associated with Madhya Pradesh.
Bajju Shyam was born in a very deep tribal family.
Even if he had done simple work for his life, he had an unprecedented dance on traditional tribal paintings.
Because of this fervor, today he is not only in India but also in the whole world.
In many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England, Italy, primitive paintings are demonstrated.
Bajju Shyam, who specializes the name of India in foreign countries, has been shown the symbol of his ability, has been honored with the Padmasri award.
The life of Tribal Lady Laxmigudi associated with Kerala can make you a pleasant surprise .
Laxmiguti works as a teacher in the Kallar area.
Even today, he lives in a dense forest area, tribes among the dwellers in the hustle dwellers.
He has kept 500 herbal medicines in his memory.
They have prepared medicines with herbs.
The snakes have been selected in the preparation of medicines to be used after finishing .
Laxmi is constantly serving the community through her her herbal medical knowledge.
Recognizing someone who was not entitled, has been honored with paying Padmasri award for his participant in society.
My mind is that I have to tell you about another one today.
The 75-year-old Subhashi Mistry of West Bengal has been awarded the award.
Subhashani Mistry, he washed the utensils in many people who made the hospital, sold vegetables.
Because he was 23 years old, due to lack of proper medical care, his husband died.
This incident gave him the idea of building a hospital for the poor.
Today, hospitals created by previous hard work have been providing free medical treatment for thousands of hard work.
There are many such male and female gems in our unprecedented gems, no one knows about them, they don't know.
If there's no sign of such people, it's a friction of society.
I'd like to speak to the people through the Padma Awards that the people who live for our fears, the people who live for the community, are doing some kind of regulations, who are leading the ladies.
We have to specialize them.
They don't work for awards.
But their actions make us enjoy.
Sometimes in schools, colleges, take such people and discuss their experiences.
All the awards, social and some efforts should be taken.
Folk folks, every year on the 9th day of the month of January we celebrate the day of the Indians of the world .
On this day only the Indian Gandhis returned to India from Afghan.
On this day we celebrate the unbelievable bond between India and the Indians worldwide.
This year, we have arranged for an event for foreign Indians.
It was known by the representatives of India in the world as well as the members of the army and the fairs .
In many countries like Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portuguese, Moricius, Fiji, Tansania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, Afghan, USA, are all guests, are executive members, they all participated.
Even if they were engaged in their fashion, they've kept their relations stronger.
This time Europe has sent me a column.
In this he has shown a very important role in the participation of Indians living in many countries of Europe in various fields .
Some of them have published a sympathy in many fields in the study of composition, ayurveda, music, poetry, weather change, Indian literature.
Some people have built graduates from truck drives, some have made mosques.
That's where we're all, all of those countries are integrated in some way.
I am demonstrating my gratitude to the citizens of Europe, as well as a remarkable accomplishment of these information worldwide.
On the 30th day of the month of January, the memorial of Gandhiji.
He showed us a new path.
That's the day we're following the devils every day.
For the sake of the country, we are giving Anjali at 11 o'clock in the morning, in a way to remind your innovative devils.
The way to enjoy peace and imagination is the way to enjoy water.
It's India, the world, the personal family, the community and the salvation of all the principles, what we have given to us, they are very supposed to be.
He didn't give us the dry ideas.
In today's era, we've come to see how good the instructions of the mine are.
Unlike we can, if we decide to go under her, what else can we pay her big nephew
My favorite folks, all of you will be able to test your 2018 years of life.
Thank you very much.
I'm sorry.
