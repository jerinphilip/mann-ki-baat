Prime Minister Mr.
On the 28th day of May 2017, the Tamilnadu translation of the special exhibition conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population at 11 a.m. Namaskar for my dear countrymen.
We can't forget the summer of this year.
We're waiting for this year.
Today, when I speak to you, the Punya month Ransan has begun.
In the coming of the month of the month of Ramasan, I take the pleasures of the people of India and the world, especially for the Muslim community.
Ramsan gives great importance to prayer, spirituality, charity etc.
We are very lucky to give our previous career to the proud tradition of India.
Let's be proud of all the species of the world in India.
It is our country that believes in God, denies God, idolaters and lives against idol worship.
We have a art of living together, together with all thoughts, all kinds of worship and traditions of all kinds.
Religions, castes, ideas, traditions, messages that give us are of peace and significance.
This month of Ramasan will help us go ahead with peace and significance.
I'm gonna take good luck once more.
Last time, at Mankis Bay, I told the youth something, about doing something new, and learning new lessons...
It's life, it's too young to make some challenges and to invite problems.
I'm very happy to have many people experienced me.
You showed me the courage to speak directly.
I can't read everything, not everyone's messages.
That's a lot of information.
But I looked at everything...
Some tried to learn music, some tried to learn a new phrase, some tried to learn some new things in the U tube, trying to study new languages.
Some read cooking, some learn dancing, some learn the play, some have learned to write poetry.
Some people are trying to live and understand nature.
I felt very happy.
A phone call wants to hear you.
I'm talking to Diksha Katya.
I've lost my reading habits.
But during this holiday, I decided to read something.
It was realized how many freedom fighters had been fighting for India to gain freedom and how many sacrifices they had spent years in prisons.
I'm involved in inspiration from Bhagat Singh, who suffered a lot of sacrifice at a young age.
So, in this matter, the new generation wants to make messages.
It's glad that the new generation wants our freedom fighters to know the people who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men sacrificed their youth in prisons.
Many young men are in the pottery.
We live in free Hindustan as a result of what to endure.
In the freedom struggle, the great men who lived in prison did a lot of literature.
Their throne powered the freedom struggle of India.
I went to Andaman Nicobar once a year ago.
Cellular went to jail.
Hero is the birth anniversary of Savark.
The heroes wrote a book "Massi Janmate" in prison.
The poems were written on the wall of the prison.
He was locked in a small cell.
How many battles that freedom fighter felt
.
I read Savarka Ray's book "Massi Janmate" and I was inspired to see Cellular Jail.
An "Light And Soundo Show" that's going there is a lot of inspiration.
People from all the states of India, who speak all languages, used to sacrifice their lives in this cellular jail in Andaman.
Speaking all languages, people from all the states, have experienced all generations.
Today hero is the birth anniversary of Savarkan.
Today we have freedom.
I'd like to bring the fact that people have suffered, how hard they have suffered.
Let's see why Kalapani says he's gone to Cellular Jail.
If you get the chance, you must go to the pilgrimage of our freedom.
My dear countrymen, June is the first Monday of 5 months.
Nothing special, June 5 is a special day.
Because the world's environment is celebrated June 5 for the day.
This year the United Nations Church has been the subject of this day ' Connecting people with nature ' -LRB- Connecting People to Nature -RRB- .
In a different way, go back to the base.
What's the relationship with nature
In my vision, it means to be connected to them, a spirituality.
It is to protect the good land from being connected to nature.
It's better than the words of Mahatma Gandhi...
Mahatma Gandhi often said, "We need to take care of the unforgettable world" - (Won's Master Care About A Waldka Wild Not Sea) that we need to think about the unprecedented world, where we are to guard.
Nature has a power.
You must have experienced.
On getting tired one glass of water on face , how much energy is there .
When you get tired, open the windows of the house, open the doors and breathe in the air passing through, it feels a new chaitanam.
When we communicate with these five elements that are finished by the body, ourselves have a new chaitanya in our body, a new energy.
We've experienced all this.
But we don't care, it doesn't take the cort in a nose.
Now, when you get into the communication with nature, you must keep in mind if there's no new chaitanya inside you.
So, June 5, the global front to connect with nature must be the first of us.
We've experienced the quality of waiting for our eastern Kar environment.
If we look at the environment, we'll get the quality of it.
It is said in the Vedics that the Earth and the environment are strong.
In Vedic, there are similar salts.
Atharvamaveda is the most important guidance of the environment.
I'd like to know that thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth, son-in-law, is said to be a prithvia.
It is said in the Vedics that the hypothesis of ours is the cause of our land.
Earth is our mother, our children.
Some things will come to understand about Buddha.
The birth of Mahatma Buddha was born in three trees like his genius, his great dynasty.
There are many festivals in our country, many admirations and environment.
The worship of nature, the love of nature, is a part of social life, even in the tribal community, in the rural areas of education and non-city.
We'll explain it to the new words, and explain the new laws.
There are some spectacular news from the states.
Often in all the states, there is a big fight in the rainy season.
Crores of trees are planted.
School kids, social organisations, government organisations and governments are heading forth.
This time too, we have to promote the tree, we have to give our contribution to it.
Dear countrymen.
June 21 is coming.
June 21 is now a special day in the world.
This day is celebrated on the day of World Yoga.
For a while, June 21 has reached every corner of the world.
Connecting people.
On one side there are many distortional forces in the world.
Then India gives a great contribution to the world.
The cort of the world is bored by yoga.
As the body connects the mind, intelligence and soul together today, Yoga enjoys the world itself.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to busyness, it is difficult to lead a life without mental stress due to more responsibility.
It's still in a short span.
Yoga has a very important role in leading a mentally stressless life in the form of eating medicines which are not necessary.
Yoga ensures mental and physical health.
Yoga is not just exercise.
With the body, with the mind, there are thoughts, and we can experience yoga for a healthy life with practice.
Two days ago, I wrote a letter to all the governments and all the leaders of the world.
Last year, I announced some competitions related to Yoga, some priests declared.
In that case, he slowly made some red words.
I had some opinions about this.
I appreciate those who sent these opinions.
It's very funny.
One says, the third International Yoga Day is communicated.
His determination is to celebrate three generations of a family together this time as the third International Yoga Day.
Appload the picture of the grandparents, grandparents and grandparents, mothers and grandparents together with three generations of male and female women.
An opportunity to give a new head to Yoga will be the synergy of today and tomorrow.
I know the gratitude of this investigation.
I think this would be a very funny feeling like she's done a program called Selfie.
This picture of three generations, together, doesn't convey curiosity in the country.
Narendramodi Apple and My Gave, together with three generations, bring me the three generations together.
This picture will be tomorrow's picture yesterday.
This will be a pleasant tomorrow.
I'm sorry for you.
There are still three weeks left to be a worldwide day.
Training begins today.
I've been posting something in the mind of yoga since June 1.
Continuously 21 days will be posted, you're gonna make a share.
You're also inspired about yoga for three weeks, connect people with this.
It's a kind of healthcare plan.
I invite anyone to be part of it.
When you took me the responsibility of the chief servant, you got the opportunity to speak first on August 15 in the Red Fort of Delhi.
I spoke about my own selfishness.
I'm going to different parts of Hindustan since then.
What are some moody doing
Where's Money going
Money is constantly looking at what he did.
I had a very funny phone call in this connection.
Maybe I didn't think of this way.
I'm gratitude to him to see things like this.
If you hear this phone call, you'll understand.
"Modiji, I speak Naina from Mumbai."
Money, wherever he goes, I look regularly at the TV and the community's programmes.
Although in Mubai, in Surat, people have taken a mission in a mixed manner of self-reliance.
Not only adults, but children also have awake about selfishness.
Children who blame those who are dirty on the road are enlightened.
The Swachhta program, which started from Kashi's debt, has turned into an inspiration today.
"You're right.
Wherever I go, the government department is pouring dirt.
Today the society has become a celebration.
Five days to join me, seven days, ten days ago, there's a lot of voluntary performance.
The media also gives great importance to it.
I went to the coach of Gujarat a few days ago.
There's a huge voluntary program.
I didn't see it connected to my journey.
But when this phone call came, I thought it was right.
You can guess how much I am aware of this.
The country also pays attention to these things very well.
What's more joy than I've been in touch with my journey.
Welcome to welcome the Prime Minister, we'll have to do all the preparations, but it'll be a big deal.
It's enjoying anyone who wants it to be inspired.
Everyone who gives importance to selfishness is greeted.
Another guy's shut up.
It's very funny.
I don't know whether to do this or not.
"When Modiji decides to travel, ask those who invite me, what head will the truth be
How many tunes will you dedicate to me
I'll decide whether I should come or not.
The idea is very good.
But I have to think.
Instead of giving gifts, you have to become an activity that makes so many chappu square as a gift.
How many people can be saved from the disease.
How big will it be humanity
See these cattle as dirty as wealth and look like a generosity.
It doesn't seem to be dirty.
If we begin to see these slaves as rich, the new methods of poultry will come in front of us.
Young people associated with the startappu will come up with new plans.
I'll come with new equipment.
With the co-operation of the State Government of India, it is decided to start a major operation in the matter of dusty creation of the people of the cities.
In the World Environment Day of June 5, about 4,000 cities of the country are going to be provided for collection of Kharmaliya and Dravalliya.
There will be two kinds of chickens, one green and another blue.
There are two types of dust, fluid and skinny.
In these dustlands which we keep in these four thousand towns, we must pour in blue and green fluids.
Cooking dirt, skins of green vegetables, food cereals, eggs and leaves, etc. are fluids.
It's all useful in agriculture.
If the field of agriculture is fat then what should be done in the greenery .
The second number is for non-necessary papers, glasses, clothes, plastics, polythene, broken dobs, rubber things.
These things are kind of dry vegetables.
They must be recycled in machines.
You have to put them in the blue nest.
I'm sure we'll grow up a culture.
There's always a need for a new retreat in the matter of selfishness.
Then the dream of Gandhiji, we have to fulfil the dream of that will.
I'm proud to tell you something today.
A man's mind determines how big a population can be organized.
That's what's about selfishness.
You must have heard a news last week.
Varzova Beach, considered to be filthy in Mumbai, is a miraculous beach today.
It's not too quick.
Versolava Beach's mask has been changed for about 80-90 weeks.
Versova Beach was sweet and beautiful as a result of thousands of tons of snakes.
Its responsibility was taken by the Versova Residents volunteers.
Mr. Afros Shaw started seducing it from October 2015.
Gradually people went along.
It turned into a genocide.
Mr. Afroz Shaw gave the United Nations Environment Program a great award to him as the first Indian to eradicate the Champions of the Ernthy.
I appreciate Mr. Afroz Shaw, and thank you for this destination.
The people of that area were organized and converted into a population.
This is surely a kind of inspiration for anyone.
Brothers, I'd like to tell you something very happy today.
I've been informed that the Reasi block of Jammu and Kashmir is a free area of excitement.
I appreciate all the people of the Reasi Block and the rulers there.
Jammu Kashmir is a good example.
Congratulations to everyone.
To know that the women of that part in Jammu Kashmir took responsibility for this operation.
They went ahead to make people conscious and balled.
They went home and streets and inspired people.
I appreciate mothers and sisters there.
Congratulations are appreciated by the rulers of Kashmir to make a block free from external external land.
My dear countrymen, for the last fifteen days, for a month, in the newspaper, in the TV channel, but in the social media, nowadays, the circus is going on.
Three years ago, you made me the responsibility of the chief servant.
A lot of surveillance took place, and there was a lot of consultation.
I see all this very healthy.
This three-year-old activity has been changed in every way.
People from all over the society have destroyed it.
This is a very good way of democracy.
In the democracy, the governments must be responsible, and the government has to pay people their jobs.
Time found that our work was destroyed deeply and sometimes congratulations and sometimes the deficiencies were cheated and the people who were supposed to be grateful.
I'm giving it a lot of importance.
I thank those who know different, great opinions.
Compensations and deficiencies are now evident, and there is a chance to reconcile.
It's good, but we're very poor, but it's bad to learn from it and move on.
Active criticism strengthens democracy.
This humiliation is very important for an embarrassing nation.
My dear countrymen, I'm also a common citizen like you.
As a simple citizen, the effect of a good and bad government is like any ordinary civilization.
Some see Mankira Bath as an integral dialogue, some criticize it with a political vision.
But this long experience has understood that this Mankiyu Bath program has made me an organ of all the families of India.
When Manki Bath started, he didn't think of it.
I've been sent to my family and told me that I'm telling you about homework.
As I said, the effect of my mind as an ordinary citizen, that's important.
Two days ago, in the President Bhavan, a study of Man Keebat, including honorable President Jee, honorable Vice President, honorable Spirit, etc., was published.
As a person, this incident is very encouraging as a civilian.
Manki Ba has given importance to Manki Ba, and Spirit is gratitude to the Vice President.
They've given it the greatest importance.
In a way, Man Kee Bath has given a new head.
Some friends talked to me in the middle of the book on Mankie Bath.
I felt amazed about an artist Akbar Saheb.
He said he wants to prepare a sketch about what matters he made in Man Kee Bay.
Akbar gave a art form to Saheb Man ki Ba to express his love without paying any form.
I am grateful to Akbarsaheb.
My dear countrymen, the next time Man Kee Bath says, the country will rain, the weather will change, the results of the exams will come, the new study will begin.
When the rain arrives, a new wind and aroma will spread.
We'll move forward by expressing love to nature in this environment.
My good luck for you.
Thank you.
