Man Ki Bath February 2018, my favorite patriot, Namaskar
This time, the word in Mansu begins with a phone call-- (Leddy voice) chief minister Garu, I'm talking from Mirat to Komal Tripathy.
28th National Science Day.
The progress and growth of India are both related to science.
In science, how much we explore, as much as we develop.
Let's go.
Can you say anything like giving inspiration to our country's youth
Your inspiration can help the country's youth to transform their thoughts into a scientific way, to enhance the country.
Thank you.
Thank you a lot for calling you a phone.
My young friends are asking me a lot of questions related to science.
Sea water looks blue.
But experiencedly in our routine, we understand that water is no part of it.
When did we imagine why the water becomes sea, why the water changes
This question gave us an important scientist to modern India.
Before we talk about science, Bharat Ratna sir C.
V.
Raman's name comes to remember.
He received Ganu Nobel Prize for doing magnificent research on light scattering i . e . radiation of light.
His research was famous by the name of Raman Effect.
We celebrate the National Science Day of 28 February every year.
Because, this is the day, C.
V.
Ramanji found a fragment called light scattering.
So Ganu got the Nobel Prize.
Any scientists in our country were born in science.
On one side there is a tradition of great scholar Bodhan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta, Aryabhat etc.
On the other hand, the superior of the medical field, the church is honored to us.
Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose, scientists like Satyendranath Bose from Har Govind Khurana.
The name of the famous particle BOSON was also done on the name of Satyendranath Bose.
I got a chance to participate in a program in Mumbai.
- Wadhwani Institute for the Artificial Intelligence that's a beautiful invitation to the inauguration.
It's very interesting to know about the miracles happening in science.
Through Artificial Intelligence Robots, Bots, and others are helped to create machines to do special work.
These machines are also enhancing your intelligence as well.
This technology uses to enhance the lives of all the poor, the poor, the needy.
In that program, I can't get any help from the Artificial Intelligence to make the life of the fellow brothers beautiful
Can you possibly possibly possibly possibly use the Artificial Intelligence
What can help farmers about the production of crops
Can the Artificial Intelligence provide any help in improving the diseases in modern practices
That's what I wanted the scientific group.
For a few days I got the opportunity to go to the inauguration of ' I Create ' in Ahmedabad of Pattu Gujarat with the prime minister of Israel .
I saw a digital circle made there a young man.
The specialty of that kind is that those who don't talk about their words as they write by that circular, they reflect the form.
That's why we're not normally talking to anybody, even those who don't talk to others.
I'm supposed to use Artificial Intelligence in many ways.
The value of science and technology is cheap.
They don't have any value.
Every instrument works the same way we want.
But the instrument depends on us what we can do.
It's the human goal here.
Science should be used not only for the welfare of humans, but also to control the summits of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who has been identified by the light bulb, has failed many times in his research.
Once he asked about this matter, he said, I'd try ten years like I couldn't make a light bulb.
That's why Addison changed his opportunities as his power.
Yadrichchikmu, the lucky thing is that I'm in the Auroville of the great Arvinds.
As a revolutionary, he stood for British rule.
They fought against them.
Their administration was questioned.
Likewise, he questioned every man in life as a prince.
Recognizing the answer to them, seeing ways to humanity.
It's so important to keep questioning everyday to know the truth.
That's the most inspiration behind the scientific discovery.
Why, what, how
Easy to get answers to questions like that.
During the National Science Day, I'm telling our scientists, scientists all the fabricated people.
For truth, seeking our youth's inspiration to find out for knowledge, seeking encouragement to serve society with the help of science, I'm providing many purifications to our youth.
My friend, at the time of danger, I have many messages on matters like Safety, Disaster.
People keep coming to me something.
Rabindra Singh from Pune propagated about the Occupational Safety in the message sent to the Narendra Modi app.
They said that the faculties in our country, the Safety Standards grew great at work.
On the fourth day of March, National Safety Day, so, the Prime Minister has asked for some precautions about security in his Manki Bath program, and he has come to raise awareness about security in the people.
When we talk about security in public places, we should talk about two important matters of pro-activeness, preparedness.
Security is two types.
At the time of humiliation, it was one among the oppressors.
The second is useful in daily life.
Safety in everyday life.
If we don't care about security in a lifetime, it'll be difficult to get security at the time of danger.
All of us are studying the boards on the way many times.
In them - concentration . danger happens - a mistake harms - joy , cheats , joys - so quickly enhancing restrictions - do not play with safety - do not lose life like this .
That path cannot be used in all our lives because of those evils.
But if you're leaving natural conditions, most of the dangers are due to our necklace.
If we are unprecedented, take necessary precautions, save our lives, save society from bigger dangers.
Once you work, there's a lot of information about security.
But no one plays them properly.
I'm supposed to have a mack drill in front of children in different places in a month, weekly with the aggravation of the religious groups of towns.
There are two uses.
The fire magnificence also gets a chance to remain unprecedented.
The young man also gets training related to these .
There's no extra scratch except for this.
It becomes part of education.
I've ever been talking about this.
Regarding the dangers, the opponents, India's environmentally, geographically, many different countries.
This country has faced many chemical, industrial accidents that make many natural, man-made accidents.
National Disaster Management Authority i.e. NDMA is operating the major disaster in the country.
When there are various types of dangers like earthquakes, floods, storms, etc., the NDMAs will soon be there when the rescue operation occurs.
They also released some guidance formulas.
Besides, they're also conducting training programs for Capacity building.
In floods, storms, a program was organized by the name of Aapda Mitra for Valentirla training.
Training, impression is so important.
Each Ataa volcano died due to hot ashes in two folds.
That's why the NDMA did the workshop to control hot ass.
People started propaganda to raise irrelevantness.
The climate has put an absolute estimation.
A good result has come forward with everyone's help.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to hot guards decreased to nearly 200.
That's why we know, if we give priority to security, we can be safe.
I appreciate unprecedented people, social organizations, unprecedented civilians, who are involved in helping programmes in a minute where there is such a danger in society.
Fire and Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Paramilitary Forces, our soldiers also help the people unable to take their lives through a lot of courage.
NCC, scouts etc. are also doing such work.
Training is also given.
A few days ago another attempt was also started.
In countries, just as Joint Military Exercise is concerned, all the world countries together have thought why not even joint exercise for Disaster Management.
In India's leadership, all the countries like BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal have made a joint disasters management exercise.
It's a first, great human use.
We have to make a pramada chaitanya samajam.
To protect our values in our culture, i.e. always say about the safety values.
But we must also know the values of safety of values.
They must be part of our life.
Normally we're traveling in the plane many times.
In the beginning of the airplane, their hostess is giving information about security.
We all hear all these suggestions many times.
But if someone asks us to take us to the plane, where the life jacket is, how to use it, I'm sure I can't answer anybody in us.
Is there a facility to provide information
That's it.
Do you have a chance to see them directly
That's it.
But we'll keep an eye on.
Why that means we're unprecedented in nature.
So nobody in us thinks that our ears are listened carefully, not sitting in the plane, but that's what we're doing.
We think every field of life is the same.
We don't think this security is not for us.
If we all agree to our security, social security will also be under it.
My favorite patriot, this time, in the budget, started a program to waste, waste to Energy, meaning to make wealth from wastes, energy from wastes, for the spread of Swachh Bharat villages.
It's called Gobar-than.
"GOBAR-Dhan" means Galvaniing Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
This gober-than aims to purge the villages, to purge animals, to convert the central marine COMPOST, to BIO-GAS, to produce energy through them.
The number of animals in India is almost thirty-five crores.
Twenty-fifty million tonnes of plantation.
Some European countries, Chinese animals, survivors are used to produce energy.
But they don't use them completely in India.
Switch India is now running in this direction part of Mission Rural.
A goal of producing the basic power of bio gas has been demonstrated from the vains available from animals' bases, central minerals.
In rural India under Gober Dhan Yojana, farmers are encouraged not only to look at the brother-in-laws, but also to look at the medium of charity.
There are many benefits in rural areas by the Gobar Dhan Passam .
It helps keep the villages clean.
The health of animals grows sharp.
Their products grow.
By bio gas, cooking and lighting cosmos increase yourself in the matter of energy required.
This పథకం helps the farmers, animals, to increase their profits.
New job opportunities for West Collector, Transport, Sicill Market, etc.
The Gobar Dhan Passum also prepares a funny treading platform to move smoothly.
It deals with farmers, shopping stores.
Because of this, Ganu gets the right price for farmers, central utilities.
I explore businessmen, especially the siblings in rural areas to come forward.
I'm asking you to adjust this essence by setting up self-successful friends, co-operatives.
Clean Energy and Green Jobs are inviting you to participate in the ceremony.
Don't change the vainness in the villages, go to the direction of making Gobar-Dhan.
My favorite country famous, we've been listening to many kinds of festivals like Music Festival, Food Festival, film festivals, etc.
But in the Chattisgarh Raipur the first waste festival was organized by a special effort .
The purpose behind this festival, launched by Raipur Municipal Corporation, is the clarity of clarity.
Don't use the city's martial genetics, to give information about the various methods of using it back to the museum.
In the various activities under the part of this festival, all of the students belong to the eldest.
A variety of artworks used by mines were made.
West Establishment Taluk has also arranged work shops to make people educated at all points of view .
There was also a singing program on the purification headquarters.
Artwork was also done.
After getting inspiration from Raipur many other districts have also been celebrated in different ways .
Everyone has shared creative thoughts about clarity on their own.
I've discussed.
The poems were performed.
There was a festival atmosphere about cleanliness.
Especially school students are so excited about it.
In order to exhibit West Establishment, Clean Taluku in this festival in various ways, Ganu Raipur Municipal Corporation, all the Chattisgarh people, all the governments there, I'm telling for the instrument of the Palna.
Everything March is celebrated on the first day of International Women's Day.
In our country, there are many programs in the world.
On that day in our country ' Nari Shakti Prize ' all the women performed in different colors are honored .
The country's woman development from the woman-lead development is moving forward in the direction.
That is, we're talking about women-healthy growth by walking ahead of women's growth.
During this time I remember Swami Vivekananda ' s words : 'He thinks that the perfect womanhood of the die is perfect independence ' - Swami Vivekananda's opinion that in the last few years of Indian culture expresses the power of strength in the Indian culture.
It is our duty to provide equal rights to women in all parts of social, economic life.
It's our responsibility.
Recognition of men is part of the tradition created by women.
Your Majesty, Kausalya Nandan, Ganthari sons, this was the identity of every son.
Now our women are introducing us all self-confidence through their actions.
Become yourself rich.
To run yourself forward, all the nations, and all the communities, they worked to reach a new mirror.
Where the woman is powerful, she is equally partner in the overall development of the country, our dream of New India.
A few days ago, one gave me great advice.
Several events are going on during the Women's Day celebrations on March 8th.
Can the mothers, sisters, who have completed hundreds of years of life in every village under it
That's questionable.
Can they have a chance to know the things of their long life in that sacred event
Asked that.
Naka thought was very good.
It's pretending to you.
You can get examples to know what women can do.
Looking at your surroundings, you'll find a story that inspires your life.
Right now I've got information from Jharkhand.
Around 15 lakh women in Jharkhand under the purification campaign - this is not the only small number - ten lakh women together have started purification for one month .
In this propaganda started from 2018, January 26, only twenty days, these women have set up a new example by building a lakhs of fifty thousand schools.
About a lakh Sakhi Samiti meets in it.
Fourteen lacs of women, two thousand panchayat representatives, twenty nine thousand water helpers, ten women self-sufficient women, eighty thousand women living with handicrafts.
You can imagine it's so big event.
The women of Jharkhand assumed that the purity of purity in ordinary life can be effective in transforming the purity of ordinary people as a natural propaganda.
Brother Sodari Manulara, I've seen the news two days ago that the power came after twenty-fives of the three villages of Elephanta Island.
Because of this there are so many fun in the people there .
You all know well, Eliphanta island is ten kilometers away in the sea from Mumbai.
It's a big tourist center.
Elephanta caves are part of their world heritage UNESCO.
There everyday tourists come in large numbers from the country and abroad .
A major tourist spot.
I was very close to Mumbai, and I was surprised to know that these shits could not come to power.
Three villages of Elephanta Islands up to twenty-fives - the darkness in the lives of people in Raj Bandar, Mour Bandar, Santh Bandar has just disappeared.
Their lives have glowed.
I'm telling the public, the public there.
I enjoyed Elephanta Caves, Elephanta villages glowed with electric power.
It's not just electric.
A new morning for development.
The enjoyment of the lives of the natives, the enjoyment of their lives, the enjoyable moments of enjoyment, is there any more
My favourite brother-in-law, recently we celebrated the Shivratri festival.
Now with the artistic fields of the month of March, the golden golden golden colours, the beauty of the arrows of the heart, all these specialties of this month.
Holi festival coming this month also has a lot of love for us this month.
On the second day of March Holi festival is celebrated throughout the country with fun .
How much colorful importance is in Holi festival , the same importance is Holika Dhahana .
This is the day of destroying bad fire by digging .
All the differences in mind forget, all sitting together, the charm of enjoying each other is Holly.
This festival gives messages to love, uninterrupted, brother-in-law.
During the Holi festival of all the natives , the festivals of Holi are celebrated .
Cleans filled with colors.
This festival wants to enjoy colorful joy in our lives of all our nations.
Thanks to many of my favorite countrymen.
Namaskara.
