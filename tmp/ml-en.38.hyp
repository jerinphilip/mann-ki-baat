Prime Minister Mr.
On the 27th day of December 2015, the Tamilnadu language of the special launch conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population at 11 a.m.
My dear countrymen.
Everyone's greetings.
This is the last Man Ki Bath of 2015.
Next Man Ki Bath will be in 2016.
Now we celebrate Christmas.
Welcome to the New Year.
There is no shortage of festivals in our country.
Festivals after one.
In a way, a festival is forgotten by giving the signal of another.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country that earns financial frequency through festivals.
Festivals of the community change the opportunity for economic illusion.
My Christmas- New Years.
Two and a half, seventeen, everybody gets a joke.
Let's give you new hopes and new decisions to the top.
The world can be freed from terror and global warfare and natural disaster.
What are we enjoying beyond human beings leading a happy life
Do you know I'm using technology well
I've got a lot of information through that.
My gov.
I pay attention to the portal.
Mr. Pune.
Ganesh V.
Savelesh Warker wrote to me this season tourist season.
Many national and foreign tourists are coming.
People celebrate Christmas holidays.
When he says he's trying to arrange a lot of facilities in the tourism sector, he's a stupid fact.
It is important to pay special attention to cleanliness in tourism and target locations.
I welcome Ganeshji's opinion that India's pride will rise as much as our tourist centers are clean.
And I'll bring his opinion to you.
We're gonna say the guest God.
When the guest comes, we keep the house clean and decorated.
We have to take care of this in the tourist centers.
I'm glad news about purity from all parts of the country.
I'm thankful to my media friends.
Because they've even found such small things, they're in front of people.
I read a news in the newspaper here.
It wants to tell people.
The worker of Bhojpur village of Sehore district of Madhya Pradesh is the leader of the sing mall.
Now he lives with ordinary textiles.
The news about him was published in the newspaper by the special things he did.
I thought I wanted to know you when I was careful.
Villagers have decided to provide free work to make a surveillance if someone has access to the necessary materials in the village of singing mall.
In Bhojpur village, he built hundreds of surveillances without buying money through his work.
I appreciate Dr. Sing Malaya with my heart.
Sometimes they hear things disappointing from many corners of the country.
It's the power of the country that millions of people do good things like Egypt.
This is the hope of leading the country.
That's why I am glad to appreciate the act of Dhilip Singh through Manki Bath.
There's a lot of unexpected efforts behind our country's progress.
125 million people advance with their shoulders.
He leads the country forward.
There are new opportunities for education and employment.
Insurance security, this unit helps us in banking services.
Ordinary people who cannot even reach the bank's neighbourhood are getting unpleasant loans today.
When the whole world was attracted by yoga and celebrated the International Yoga Day, we believed and proudly believed in the strength of India.
That's what we're surprised to be real India.
This imagination seems to be ours when India sees its magnificence.
Who can forget the events of Yashoda and Krishna of Purana.
Yashoda recognized his power when Balakrishna sworn the whole of the Brahmand in his mouth.
Yoga dynasty has given India the same strength.
The word of purity is heard in the house today.
People's participation is increasing in it.
After so many years of independence, the joy of the people of villages coming to electric pillars cannot imagine the people who are constantly comfortable with electricity.
The Central Government and the State Governments and the Electricity Departments used to do this.
But in 1000 days, in this village, the news of electricity has arrived in another village today, with the decision to bring electricity to the village.
There haven't been discussions about this in the media.
But I'm sure the villagers' joy and enthusiasm will be brought to the public through electricity.
That's why the biggest achievement is that the government officials who are trying for this will be compulsory.
They can be proud of giving something to that village through their endeavour, and make some change in their lives.
Farmers, poor, young, women, don't they want to know
I don't know what government did, what government did not do.
I want to know whether those who worked for it have their right or not.
Truly, how many people can get the right thing and good things.
That's a service route.
I've done a little effort on my way.
I can't do everything alone.
But I can do something.
Every ordinary citizen of this country can contact me by downloading 'Narendra Moti Ap' on a mobile phone.
Let's share small things like this.
My greetings are going to tell me a lot.
You also have partners in your way.
You don't have to bring it to 125 million people.
How can I do this without your help
Come on, let's get them to their own language for the quality of the common people.
My dear young men, in the red fort on 15th August, started the first discussion about Stand App India.
After that, it was discussed in government departments.
Can India be the Start App capital
In order to make young people a big opportunity between the states, new start apps and new inputs, which are in the production sector, in the service sector, we can start carsica cleaning.
In every case, new thinking, new methods cannot move the world without this.
Start up India, Stand up India opens a great opportunity for young people.
My young friends, on January 16, the Government of India is launching plans to bring the Start of India Stand Ap India Activity.
It will be presented to you for what it will be.
It's the country's I.
I.
T.
I...
I.
M, Central University, N.
I.
Young people in TT will be partners in this plan.
There's a strong idea between us attached to Start Ap.
Let's be digital world, I.
T.
Profession, this start up is for them, it's not like that.
We have to make changes for the country's needs.
In order to discover the physical illness of a poor person who works, the youths will be helpful in their hard work.
I see this as Start App.
I'm telling the banks to help such youths.
I'm asking the youth to move bravely.
I'm gonna get the ratio.
Do you want to concentrate only in some cities on the intellectual wealth of our youths
It's wrong if you think so.
Young people in any corners of India have to give them a chance.
Start up India, Stand Ap India shouldn't cross in a few cities.
It must spread to every corner of India.
I wish the State Governments to spread it.
I'll discuss this with you clearly on January 16.
I'll welcome your instructions.
My dear young men, January 12 is the victory of Swami Vivekananda.
There are millions of people like Swami Vivekananda.
Since 1995, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti is celebrated as the National Youth Festival of 12 January.
This year it is celebrated from 12 January to 16 in Raipur of Chhattisgarh .
This time, his compliment is 'the development of the new youth and the co-operation'.
From all the states I have received information, ten thousand youths from all over India will participate in it.
A small India is going to be created there - a young India.
In a way, dreams can be seen.
I can see the power of decisions.
Can you share your suggestions about this young festival
Especially I hope you'll be connected directly to the Nirendra Moni Ape.
I'm sorry to give it to the National Youth Festival.
That's why I'll give the government the right direction.
Friends, Narendra Modi, I'm waiting for suggestions related to Young Festival.
The visual teacher of Ahmadabad in Gujarat is Dr. Chauhan.
He celebrated Axesible India Day at his school.
After that, he explained his ideas through the phone.
Idisar, we celebrated the Axible India camp at school.
I'm a visual teacher.
About 2000 children talk about discrepancies.
He explained how to help the discrepancies.
The reactions of those kids were surprised.
Children came forward with inspiration from this.
I think it's the result of your action taken by the front.
Dindeb ji, thank you a thousand.
You're a man working in this area
So you can understand it.
Are you sure you have to suffer a lot
Sometimes there are many thoughts that we see people in the society.
As per our thoughts, we will raise our vision.
Some may be accidentally individuals, some may be congenitally limited.
For such people there are many uses in the world.
There are sometimes discussions about the use of that substance.
I feel like that.
Hey, it's not right.
Isn't this the word that hurts their pride
That's why many words have been seen for them.
Perhaps the discrepancies, sometimes organisms, sometimes the difference between the words.
It's true that every word has its own importance.
This year the Government of India has started successful India campaigning.
I should have attended the program.
But in some districts of Tamilnadu, especially in Chennai, I had to go there because of the horrific floods.
So I couldn't participate in Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
My opinion could be recorded if he was involved in it.
God has given some physical deficiencies.
Any of their organs don't work properly, we call them a wizard.
But when we meet them, we know that God has given them the supreme strength even if they lack externally.
There's a different power in them.
I can't see it with my eyes.
We recognize their actions.
Yeah.
How can this be done
And then I thought they had absolute power through experience, external or individual.
From that recognition, I felt why don't you use Divyangan's word instead of a discrepancy
They've acquired a divine power without us in one or more organs.
I like this paddam.
Didn't we inspire the word Divyangan instead of the word "Vikalangan"
I hope you take this.
Are we starting Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan
By developing all kinds of basic facilities, they will bring them to facilitate.
Schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, ramps at the railway station, parking, lift, brailley lippy, all these are needed to be easy.
Technical tricks are necessary, the system needs responsibilities.
It's begun to try.
The Janpankalit is getting.
People love it.
You can also work with it in your own way.
My dear countrymen, the government's plans will continue, but we want to make plans alive.
They have to live until the plans arrive at the last grace.
You shouldn't finish the files before.
In fact, the plans are for ordinary people and malignants.
In the last few days, the Indian government has investigated how to benefit the rightful owners of the scheme.
In our country, gas cylinders are subsidized.
Crores of rupees are given in subsidies.
But it didn't exactly have the calculations of whether it came to the beneficiary.
It wasn't even checked whether you're keeping the data properly.
So the government has made some changes in this.
Consolidated with Aadhaar card, Jandhan's account is the world's largest director, Benefit Transfer Skim, directly sending subsidi to the benefactor's bank account.
I'm sure I've got a place in the Ginn's Book of World Records by the world's most successful Direct Benefit Transfer Skim.
This scheme called 'Pahal' is successfully implemented.
By the month of November, about 15 million els.
P.
The G sub-dividents have become the beneficiaries of the Pahal scheme.
That's why the subsidies go directly to 15 million people's bank account.
No monsters, no supervisions, no corruption.
On one side, the Adhaar Card Campaign, on the other, opening Jandhan account, and setting up a list of beneficiaries with central state governments and connecting them with a bank account through aid.
There were many complaints about the funds of the work plan that worked in the villages.
In many places the money is directly deposited in the workers' accounts.
There were complaints about students' scholarship.
It's begun to solve it.
Approximately 40 crore rupees have come directly to the accounts of consumers through various schemes.
About five to four thousand plans are included in the Direct Benefit Transfer Skim.
My dear Indians, January 26, are the golden moments of the Indian Republic.
This year, our ruler, Dr.
Baba Saheb celebrates the 125th birth anniversary of Ambedkar.
Two days in the parlment were kept for a special discussion on the administration.
It was a good experience.
There have been discussions for every party to understand the piousness and importance of every community and rule.
We have to spread these discussions.
Would Republic Day agree with people's policies in the right meaning
Our constitution gives us a lot of powers.
That's why the discussions about power rise.
At the same time, the administration is giving rise to the debts.
But there's a lot of discussions about debts.
Most of the debts we're aware of are at the time of the election.
Voting is our duty to convince us through advertisements and revelations.
Why don't we talk about rituals in everyday life like the election time
On 26th January, when the country celebrates the 125th victory of Baba Saheb Ambadekar, the discussions will be organized based on rituals in schools, colleges, villages, towns, organizations.
If 125 million people revolve one after another, it will be an unforgettable history.
Let's start with the discussions.
On 26th January, I wrote a letter in your mother tongue, Hindi or English about rituals.
I want to know your thoughts.
Please send me to the port.
I want to know how young people think about duty in my country.
I want to keep a little suggestion forward.
On 26th January, when the Republic Day was celebrated, didn't we try to clean the idols of great people in our Naga and the Christian regions and through our citizens, to clean the school and college children
It's not a government matter. I'm moving forward.
How virtually do people come forward to establish great statues
But we're so sad to keep it away.
We can't make it a routine by cleaning the idols of the great men coming in January 26 through the Janpaganga
Pleasants, once again, New Year of 2016.
Thank you.
