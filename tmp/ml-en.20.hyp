Prime Minister Mr.
Narendra Modi, on the 25th of June, 11th morning, the Tamilnadu language of the special launch conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population says, "My dear countrymen are greeted.
The weather is changing.
This time it was a little bit of summer.
But I'm glad you're moving in time as usual.
Climate is comfortable due to the well-planned rains in the different parts of the country.
The cold winds after rain have been relieved from the heat in the past.
Whatever busy life, how much tension in your life or in public life, changes our mentality in the rainy season.
Today the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated with great respect and happiness in many parts of the country.
Now in many parts of the world Lord Jagannath has started celebrating the Ratha festival.
The poor people of the country are very concerned with Lord Jagannath.
Dr.
Those who studied Baba Saheb Ambedkar will know that he praised the temple of Jagannath and the traditions there, because he belongs to social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
You know a word Jagarnat in English.
It means no one can stop it.
Looking at the meaning of this Jagarnat's nigh, this word is drowned from Lord Jagannath's chariot.
We can understand how Jagannath's royal journey was made in his own way.
On this occasion of Lord Jagannath's Rath Yatra, I commemorate all the natives and embrace Lord Jagannath's grace.
The variation of India is its valuable and power.
Ramsan's pious month celebrated with the worship of all.
It's here now.
On this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, everybody wishes Id.
The month of Ramsan is a month of sacred donation, the month of happiness is shared.
Happiness increases as part of it.
Come, let's share happiness with the inspiration from these sacred festivals, leading the country.
In this pilgrimage of Ramsan, an inspirational incident happened in the Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
Our Muslim brothers' families, about 3500 years old, live in that small village.
In a way, the sisters of the Muslim family are more than the population.
During this Ramsan, the villagers decided to build a toilet together.
There is money from the government to build a toilet.
About 17 lacs of rupees helped them.
When you know, it would be surprising and joyful - in the month of the month of Ramsan, all the Muslim brothers and sisters of that place rolled up the government for 17 lakh rupees.
They said our toilet will be built with our money.
Please spend 17 lakh rupees for the village's other requirements.
I appreciate all the villagers of Mubarakpur to make Ramsan a good opportunity for the sacred occasion.
Every act of them is very inspiring.
The most important thing is that they liberated Mubarakpur.
Three states of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala were declared as free states of exposure.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana were also announced.
I express my gratitude to these five states and rulers and officials.
Well, we know that if something is good in personal life and society, we need to do so much.
If our handwriting is bad, it'll be very careful for a long time.
Then the habit of body and mind changes.
That's what's about selfishness.
Some bad habits are part of our nature.
It's part of our habits.
We'll have to work continuously to get rid of this.
Everyone's got to be attracted.
Remember the good events increment.
I'm glad you're not having a government program today.
Now it's turning into a predecessor of the common people.
How much power increases when people ruled with people's participation.
.
I've got a very good event last day.
I would like to tell you that.
The event of Vijaynagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration started a major operation with public cooperation.
It's a hundred hours long operation from 6 am to 14 a.m. to 10 a.m.
What was the target
Construction of ten thousand toilets in 71 village panchayats for centuries.
My favourite patriots would be happy to know that the work made by the ordinary people and the regime was successfully completed by ten thousand toilets within 100 hours.
71 villages are free from external irrigation.
I congratulate the government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijaynagar district.
They put forward a great example of inspiration through the supremacy of the universe.
This is where Man Keeba has more instructions from the people.
Nandermodi Apple and My Gav.
In and through letters, the skyway.
Mr. Light Triskiller wrote memorizing the era of emergency.
The triumph of June 25 was reminded of the dark period of democracy.
This vigilance of light tri-school to democracy is appreciable.
Democracy is not a system but a culture.
The Atanel Principles Is the Price of Liberty is the price of freedom.
Continuous awareness is needed in the matter of democracy, so things that are harmful to democracy must be remembered.
And we must move to the direction of the good things of democracy.
On June 25, 1975, it was an unforgettable period of reliance.
In a way, the ruling party was making the country a legend.
Burned the voices of the opposition.
Jaiprakash, along with Narayan, put the respected leaders of the country in jail.
I can't escape the terrible shadow of justice and emergency.
Press has made the newspapers absolutely neutral.
Students in today's pressing sector and working with democracy are constantly trying to increase the awareness of the people towards democracy by recalling that dark period.
On that day, Atal Bihari Wazpaiji was in jail.
It was a year since the oppression declared that Atalji wrote a poem.
He describes in that poem that time.
Burning and burning in the winters of winters , blindness of the moonlight , burning in the winters , in the winters , the shrines of the moonlight , the birds of the birds , the life of the world passing through a year , in which the birds and birds of the world , birds , birds , birds , birds , birds , till the Earth and the silver ears passes a year , passing through a year , the world with every minute and routine , the world of every day returns , even though God of whoever has come back a year has passed away .
The people who loved democracy fought a big battle.
A country like India, such a huge country.
When there was a chance, how democracy was mixed up in every citizen's nerve, it was demonstrated by the election.
Democracy spread in every man's nerve is our unprecedented spiritual self.
We have to make this paternal sweet more efficient.
My dear countrymen, all the Hindustanis are proud of the world today.
2017 June 21 became the world.
People from the sea to the mountains have welcomed the sun rays of the east.
It must be a Hindustani who doesn't feel proud.
It wasn't before the yoga.
And when Yoga was composed by the rock of yoga, Yoga became an eye to recognise the world.
Most of the countries in the world have made Yoga Day a chance.
In China, people were supposed to be overwhelmed.
People at a height of 2400 metres from sea level in the middle of Machu Pachu in Peru.
In France, people met in the shadow of Eiffel Tower.
More than four and a half people together in the country's civilization.
In Herat of Afghanistan, India Afghan organized a combined combination of Selma and gave a new head to India's friendship.
This program was organized at 70 places in a small country like Singapore, a week-long program was organized.
The United Nations launched 10 stamps related to the International Yoga Day.
In the United Nations Headquarters, the program was organized by Yoga Seson Vith Yoga Masters.
The officers of the United Nations, the world's diplomats, etc. were involved in this.
This time Yoga has created a world record once more.
In Ahmedabad, about 50,000 people together made new world records.
I had a chance to attend the yoga program in Lucknow.
For the first time I got the opportunity to do yoga in the rain.
Our soldiers celebrated the minus 20, 25, 40 degrees in the cold siyachina.
Our civilian BSF, IDBP, CRPF, CISF are all part of yoga with their duty.
In this yoga, I said three generations, because it's the third international day.
I told you that three generations of the family should join together and share their photo.
Some television channels have introduced it.
There are many photographs related to this, some of the photographs chosen from which are included in the Nadarmodi app.
There's another good thing that is being discussed in the world as well as in yoga.
Aware of health, today's society moves in the direction of physical health.
They believe physical health is good, but yoga is an excellent way for adventure.
Listen to Dr. Anil Sonara speaking to Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
"The precious Prime Minister said in Kerala next time, instead of giving a bako gift at different places, he should give good books to memorize."
It started in Gujarat during your reign.
But in the next few days, the use of bucks is more visible.
Can't you do anything
Can't you do anything to pursue books instead of bucks
On the last day, I had a chance to go to a very dear program.
P. in Kerala
My.
Worker Foundation programme is for years.
People celebrate the reading day and the reading month for the habit of reading books.
It had a chance to go to the inauguration this year.
They said they give books instead of buckets.
I thought I was good.
I remember that I had forgotten.
When I was in Gujarat, the book instead of Bucket, or the process of handles was started.
It was said that Khaddi's handles would have been encouraged.
This program continued till I was in Gujarat.
But after leaving, the habit left.
But in this program of Kerala, I've got it again.
Now it's starting to give you a report down.
Let's slowly make it a habit.
Bucket's life is too short.
You're gonna leave it after you bought it.
But if you give the book, it turns into a kind of house.
It's part of the family.
Welcome to Khadi's handles and welcome the poor families, so it's beneficial.
The cost will be less, so it will be used properly.
I want to tell you how important it is.
When I went to UK last year, the ueen of Britain invited me to eat in London.
It was the atmosphere of maternal love.
She fed me very funny, but afterwards she switched me with a small khadinul in a very respectful atmosphere.
He told the bright eyes that he sent Gandhiji to his divorce.
It's been years, but Elizabeth's queen has kept the handles given to Mahatma Gandhi.
I was seeing it with great pleasure in it.
I wanted to look at it when I was watching it.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi is part of his life, part of his history.
.
I know these habits don't change at night.
It's gonna be a narrative when you say such things.
But there's a need to talk about such things, the effort must continue.
I can't tell you if you give your bucks when you go anywhere.
It can't be done.
But there will be criticisms.
But I'll tell you.
We'll slowly change.
My dear countrymen, there are various types of jobs under the title of Prime Minister.
The files are drowned.
But in the letters coming to me, some letters have been used to read daily.
That's why I have a chance to connect with ordinary people.
Several types of letters are available, many kinds of people are burning.
I suppose you're supposed to have a letter last day.
In the southern Tamil country, a family of sweets from Madhu gave me a liar.
You know what was in that letter.
I've been thinking about some financial matters in the children's studies.
I thought the family could have some financial help.
That's why I took the loan from the bank according to the print plan.
The work of buying some things from the market started.
I've noticed that there was an arrangement in the name of Government e-market Place.
Some people asked what's busy.
I registered the name of it.
If you get the chance I want to tell the natives, look at E-jam in the Internet.
It's a new kind of strange plan.
Those who want to distribute something to the government, who want to distribute small stuff - power bubbles, jackets, chalks, chairs, tables etc., register it.
What kind of thing you're in your hand, you can indicate what time you sell it.
The government departments must look into it for sure.
Look who's paying a little price without paying gratitude in the quality of the buyer.
And send the order.
That's why there's no room left.
It's pretty sweet.
Everything's going on through technology without television.
I mean, e-jamm has been registered by the Government Department.
You'll get cheaper because you don't have a nigger.
Now they've registered this website about the things they're giving them.
They wrote to me is very interesting.
They say, "I got money in the money plan, business started, and added a list of what I can do in E-jamm.
I got orders from the Prime Minister's office, from the PMO.
It was a new news for me too.
They suggested what they bought at the PMO and bought two thermos.
I got 1600 rupees.
It's hygiene.
This is the opportunity to promote the industry.
If I didn't write a letter, I wouldn't have noticed it.
I didn't know how to buy a thing from a small family who worked in Angdoor to the Prime Minister's office.
This is the power of the country.
It has sufficientness, hygiene, which has industrial potential.
Government E Market Place-jam.
Connect more to those who sell goods through them.
I think it's a good example of the low government, the best governance.
What's the target... less expensive, more convenience, ability and goodness.
My dear countrymen, on one side, we are proud of Yoga, on the other hand, we will be honored with our ability in the Space Science.
India's specialty is that our legs are connected to yoga, but our dream is more likely to pass the rocks of the sky away.
In the past, India has shown a great performance in the field of sports and knowledge.
Today, India is not only in the earth but also in the atmosphere.
Two days ago, ISRO-Cartosat-2 distributed 30 nano tools with the planet of Syria.
Apart from India, there were 15 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
This Nano substance of India will provide a lot of help in the field of agriculture, agriculture and natural resources.
We'll remember ISRO GISAT 19 successfully a few days ago.
It was the most weighted planet in India's dispersed idols.
Our country's newspapers compared it to the elephant's weight.
We can only guess what our scientists have done in the environment.
On June 19, Mrs. was completed thousand days for Mangalya.
The mission was aiming at 6 months when we found the madness of the madness successfully.
It was six months old.
But six months have passed since our scientific efforts, not only after thousands of days, our mungalians are missioning, sending pictures, giving information, scientific disciplines.
That means it works beyond its own age.
In our scientific journey, it's a big retreat in our journey.
This is where our youth's enthusiasm grows in the field.
With studies, our young generation has begun to find out their future.
Because of our sports, because of their hard work, their skills enhance the nation's ranks.
In the next few days, India's badminton player raised the pride of the country by winning the Kidambi Srikanth Indonesia Open.
In this achievement, he and his trainer congratulated heartfully.
Sportsman, P.
T.
Usha's excitement was an opportunity to connect with the inauguration of the Synthetic Track of School of Athletics.
As much as we are associated with games, Sportsman Spirit also increases.
Sports play a very important role in personality development.
The importance of sports in the overall personality development.
There's no shortage of talents in the country.
If our family and children are interested in games, they should be encouraged.
Don't separate them from the field and make books.
Studies, let's move, grow, but if you want, school, curriculum, family, everybody will be strong, encourage.
We have to dream for the next Olympic.
Once again, my dear countrymen, rainy season and continuous excitement.
Together, this time it's a new experience.
You're gonna have fun once more.
Let's say something else in the next Man Keybat.
Good luck.
