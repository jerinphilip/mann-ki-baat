Folks, call the voice of the mind (Man Keep) November 2017.
A few days ago, there was a possibility of a distance between the young friends of Karnataka state.
The Diames team of Karnataka has published a paper about the boys, in which they asked the boys to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
They delivered some selected letters in that article.
When I read those letters, they were good to me.
These youngsters have been aware of the problems of the country, well known about the issues that are going on in the country.
They wrote about many things.
At the same time, the Girthy Hectatory, Digital India and Smart City scheme affiliated to North Karnataka, the need to be changed into our educational style, the children are not nutritious even today's class studies, they have expressed their interest in knowing the nature.
If we give us information about nature to the children, they are likely to live in natural security in the future.
The child named Rida Nataf from Laxmeshwar, is also the daughter of a military hero, who writes and gives himself a great honor.
Which Indian doesn't have a great deal on the military valor
No wonder you're in the field of military heroes, you're getting humiliated.
If I wrote what Irfana Begum is from Kalpuri, his school is 5 km from his village.
Me.
It's far away, so that it's going to be quickly roaming out of your house and staying home from school to thirty night, so that you can't spend time with your friends.
There's a suggestion that there should be a school nearby.
In the people of the country, a newsletter enjoys me taking such a lead, these letters have come to me, and I have the chance to read them.
It was a kind of experience on me.
My folks, 2611 today.
The 26th of November is our capital legal day.
In 1949, today's day, the capital legislation of India was accepted in the capital session.
On the 26th day of January, the year of 1950, the capital came to him.
That's why we celebrate it as the President.
The capital law of India is our mother of the Jews.
Today is the day we remember the members of the State Legislature.
They tried to cross 3 years to extract the capital legislation of India.
Those who read those verses, in those words, what was their devotional feelings of the country's merchandise.
Don't you know how hard they work for a capitalist country with confusion
Understanding, with the point of view of telescope, when the country is free from the treachery, they did it.
With the help of this monarchy vibrating light, the obvious thinking of those who gave the law to the capital is the treachery of all of us to form a new India.
Our monetary law is very large.
There's no part of the unexpected life in it, but it's not about nature.
The identity of our capital legislation is equality, understanding among all.
In this, the basic rights of every dweller, poor , poor , born , reproduced , tribal , women are also protected and protected for their welfare.
We have to follow a legislation of the Corporate Legislature.
To be citizens, to be rulers, to understand the feelings of capitalism.
The guidance of the narcotics is to ensure that no one has any share.
Today, on the capital day, Dr. Babasaheb Ambethak is a natural thing to remember them.
17 different groups have been formed in connection with the important matters of this Capital Committee.
It's one of the most important groups.
Dr. Babasaheb Ambethkar was headed by the temptation of the capital law.
He was dragging a significant participant.
Today we are enjoying the humiliation of the capital of India, in the formation of this, the destruction of Babasaheb Ambethkar's powerful leadership has been awarded.
He confirmed the health of all the people of the society.
The day he disappeared on the 6th day of December, we'll remember him, Angeli.
Papasakeb's partner is also reminded of making the nation self-sufficient and intelligent.
On the 15th day of the month of December, Sardar Brahbbhai Boat, he descended every day.
In the condition of the son of the farmer, the change of iron man has been done by the immense abnormal act of working the country in the same way.
Sardar, he was also a member of the State Legislature.
He was a member of the basic rights, priests, tribes and tribes.
2611, even our capital day, how can we forget this country in 2611 years ago
On the day the artisans used to be given to Mumbai.
The valorous citizens, the soldiers, the protectors, the survivors all remember the nation, the Anjali.
This country didn't forget its sacrifice.
It's a provocation that the whole world is spreading today, the dynamic is going on, it's happening in a very terrible form.
We've been fighting for the past 40 years.
Our father has killed thousands of people.
But many years ago, when talking about India's accusations in the world's plaintiff, it wasn't taken by many people in the world.
But today the arrogance shows them a great deal of gruesomeness, even if the world governments were looking for folk dogs.
Accustomed to humanity in the world.
It's only a mark to destroy human human powers.
That's why not only India, but all human powers of the world must be concentrated and argued.
The birth of Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Gandhiji etc. is given to the world, this earth is ahimsa and love.
Strong and terrible, weakening our social structure, enforcing it into a terrible attempt to cheat.
That's why it is necessary for the time to be human beings with energetic awareness.
My favorite folks, on the 4th day of December, we're celebrating the trekking day.
Indian Turkey protects our seas.
I'm supposed to demonstrate my lives to everyone connected with the Troken.
You all know that our culture has emerged on the banks of the river.
Sindh is important in both the ways of rivers , Ganges , Yamuna , Saraswati , rivers , seas , economics and wars.
It's our entrance to the world of silver.
This country has a very unbelievable connection between the coastals of the Earth.
If we saw the rocks of history, only 800-900 years ago, the rocks were considered one of the most powerful trunks.
In the expansion of the Chhole Empire, there was a great deal of his turkey in making it economically enormous.
Several specimens of royal trumpets, research journeys, musical literature are still present.
Most of the world's trumpets have long been allowed to fight women.
But only 800-900 years ago, in the royal trumpets, the major number of women are hung up.
The ladies are involved in the war.
In the Royal Registrar, there was a synonymous technology related to shipbuilding.
Couldn't we talk about the trumpet, if the Secretary Shivaji Maharaj, about the opening of his trunk
The shores of the Kongan , the Shivaji Maharaj , were in his pride.
Several forts related to the empire of Shivaji Maharaj , Sindhu Durga , Murut , Janjeera , Swarna Durga etc . are located in the seashore or surrounded by sea .
The responsibility of protecting these forts is the Maratha army .
Large ships and small ships were mixed on Maratial Troken.
His turkeys were capable of attacking an enemy or surviving.
Can't you talk about the Maratial Terror, Can you talk about Conozy Ongre
These are the Maratha trumpets carrying them to a new peak, in many places they set up Maratha Turkish lords.
After the war of Pakistan, independence of India in 1971, our troops of India showed their success in many occasions.
Trouble is the only war that takes place in our opinions, but India's turkey and human activities are also helpful in large quantities.
This year, in the month of June, when Mora was a summer busier in the traditional and Myanmar, our trunk ship.

We're bringing our own value and respect and greatness on our security forces.
Landfall, our trumpets and airplanes, our warriors' dare, courage, valor, sacredness, sacrifice, every dwellery.
125 million folks live a quiet life, because of the soldiers who sacrificed their youth for the folk.
Every year on the 7th day of the month of December , we are supposed to be a flag hoister.

Gov.
Let's indicate the library in the name.
You can also enjoy a lot of sweet sweetheart.
Come on, use this opportunity and enjoy our warriors' missions.
We'll give them our share in health.
My folks, the 5th day of December, the world's mud day.
I'd like to tell some things to our farmer brothers.
All we eat is related to this soil.
A kind of fried food is also related to soil.
Consider what if this rich soil required to produce is not in this world.
The trees don't finish, how is human life possible
How are the microscopics
Our culture is already concerned about this.
This is why in the ancient times awareness of the importance of the soil has been put up .
In our tradition, it has come from the habit of conserving this soil in order to possess agriculture on one side, soil, devotion, and feeling of drunkenness.
Believing in the soil, both the factors of this country have been reciting it as a science purity , and the farmers of this country have given great importance in their life.
Our country's peasants are genetically associated with traditionalism, in the same way they are natives on modern science, are trying and are psychological.
When I went to Borjuj area of Dohu village, which was situated in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, I asked about the farmers there.
Here the farmers have been using chemical lions all the time before, so that the soil was damaged.
Coming down the massage, the revenue was also low, slowly the productivity of the soil came to an end.
Some well-known farmers of the village understood this environment as a humiliation, then examined the soil of their land at the right time.
After being told how much use should be done in threshold, dry, natural furnaces, they accepted this advice.
The farmers got information through soil tests, their way out, don't you know what has happened
In 2016-17, the cultivation of cold crops increased by 3 to 4 times every one, the revenue increased from every one to 4 to 6 thousand rupees.
Not only this, but also the floor of the soil was visible.
Due to the lack of use of urine, there was economically absorbed.
It gave me great pleasure, my farming brothers, have preferred to embrace the suggestions they have received, when they see the outcome results, their enthusiasm increases.
If you have to pay attention to the mosque, first you have to take care of the Earth, if we keep track of the earth, the farmer's brothers are beginning to pursue ourselves.
There are more than 10 crores of soiled harvests in our entire country, through which they can know their land in a good way, so that we can take the seed.
We believe in the Earth, but when you put uria on her, do you ever see how much harm she gets
In all kinds of scientific methods it has been proved that there is a serious effect on urine putting more than urine on earth .
How can the farmer be able to smell the earth if the earth gets sick
It's time to make this male and female relationship aware again.
Could our farmers, our dwarfs, our soil dwellers, become free in 2022 and make sure that they use urea will be reduced to less than 75 years
Our landlords, my agricultural brothers, have once made this obligation, the products of Bhooththa's body are enhanced.
Farmers will be restored in their lives.
We began to experience world warmth, environmental disorders.
There was a time to start the winter before Diwali.
Now the month of December is slowly in cold .
But as soon as the winter begins, we're feeling we're embarrassed from the warfare.
But in such situations also some examples of what kind of effects those who wake up in the morning also give rise to them .
A 8-year-old boy Dushar, who created the change in Madhya Pradesh, tried to get rid of his villagers from expulsion in the open.
Doing such a large quantity of activity, isn't it a little old boy
I'm surprised
But he's many times more than age, he's fascinated, interested, deep, more.
This 8-year-old boy couldn't speak, but he was his weapon to ignore it.
Walking up at 5:00 in the morning, walking to his village's house, picking them up, making sure they don't have toilets in the open.
Everyday 30-40 houses have been taught about cleanliness , due to this priest Kumhari village was left out of the habit of extinction in the open .
This chicken guy is engaged in the work of fervorizing the sacredness.
I don't have any age for satisfaction, it shows that there is no joy.
It is important for everyone to know that the younger, the younger, the women who are sweet, the sacred, everything needs to be given a partition.
Our changing brother-brothers, psychologists, psychologists, compassionates, hypocrisy.
Every moment can learn something from them.
Today they work specially in all the areas .
The sports sector, some other competition, some social event, some of our changes aren't anybody who's ridiculous.
You might remember that our transformation sportsmen played very nicely in the Reo-Tombay and won 4 pieces, and the visually unforgettable D-20 became a member of the world cricket.
There are many types of competitions all over the country.
In the last days in Udaipur 17th National Population competition was organised .
Our younger alternate brothers, who came from different parts of the country, participated in it, showed their ability.
One of them is the 19-year-old jigger-tacker of Gujarat, even if there is no muscles in 80 percent of the body, then look at the goods, jealousy, hard work.
The 19-year-old jigger ducker wins 11 pieces of national para swimmer.
The 70th National Para Swimming Magazine wins the best wishes.
As a result of this power, he will be trained as a man of 32 Para swimmers selected by the Indian Sportsman of India, 20-20 Paralimbics, now in Gujarat's Gandhinagar as a center of excellence.
I'm supposed to describe jigger docker, I'm supposed to sacrifice my life.
Today, there is a special focus on the contradiction of changes and chances.
It's our endeavor that every person in the country should be authorized.
We must insist the society of all.
Increasing the goodness of the society through the feeling of my people, all together.
Ita-e-Milad-Un-Nabi celebrates for a few days.
Today, he was born by Myself Husrat Muhammad Saheb.
I'm telling all the folks the life of the world.
In this case, in the way the peace and faith of the society generates every day, gives new energy, gives the power of new psychology.
(CHUCKLES) Hey, Chief Minister, I'm speaking Jewelja Singh from Kanpur.
If I ask you to leave, you'll be back with us ten of the best things you say in the cheek of your mind throughout this year.
Through this, we can remind those things, learn something from them.
Thank you.
It's okay you say
The year 2017 is complete, 2018 has come closer to doors.
Good advice, and I like to see something else together.
Don't be elders in our villages, they ever forgot the sadness, don't forget happiness.
I think we should spread this blackness well.
We'll have to come to believe that Mangal had to be held in memory in 2018.
Well, we're supposed to see the passage in a year, we're in a hurry about the ideas.
We're making plans for the next year after their conclusions.
We're trying to remind the luxurious events of the past year in the publication.
There's a creative thing in it, there's a negative thing.
But in the year 2018, we can't remember the good things, don't they remember
I'm telling you a thought - if you're questioning, watching, discussing 5-10 things experienced, you don't have a good feeling.
Can you wear partition in this
Would we like to share five creative experiences in our life this time
It may be a smoking, a revelation, a sweet sweetheart... by which we're calling you all to come to the smooth environment of 2018.
Let's come with good memories.
Engage with artificial idea.
Remember artificial memories.
Come on, take part in the NarendramodiApple, MyGovle or social networking in Positive India.
We'll remember the events that will enjoy others.
Remember good things and create a good environment.
Good things, give the necessary power to do good.
Pleasant feeling leads to psychological stress.
Pleasant psychological, discarding the enjoyments, leading forward.
Come on, let's try to get engaged in Positive India this time
Through this we've made a very powerful environment, we've come to the year to come.
The strength of this cosmetic power and its impact will be connected to us.
I'm sure I'd like to try to bring these things in your Positive India into the territory.
My favorite folks, next month, in the next hole, I'll be back to you.
Get a chance to finish many things.
Thank you very much.
