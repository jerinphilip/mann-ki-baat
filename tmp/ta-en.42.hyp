On 15th day, the desperate folks of the sounding Monkey Pat program, please take care of me for all of you.
Once again, my mind's hole is supposed to be a trail to tell you.
In the southern part of the country people come to celebrate the festival .
Raksha Bandhan was celebrated throughout the country.
For the protection of the Indian government, many new schemes have been adopted by the people.
In a very short time, everybody enjoyed you in these plans.
Raksha Bandhan, on the day of the day, has left a little obligation that we should bring our sisters with the benefits of this security plan.
It has been reported that only 11 crore families have joined themselves with this scheme since the beginning of the program.
I enjoy that half of the followers are like mothers and sisters.
I think it's a good symptom.
All the mothers, sisters and Raksha Bandan demonstrate many lives in the sacred bath.
Just a year ago, Jan started working on his plans in large quantities.
Several questions, doubts were raised that a plan that couldn't be completed in 60 years.
But it's a matter of joy that all the departments, all the branches of banks, with full power, were engaged in this plan.
It's only 17 on the basis of the information I've received so far.
75 crore bank loans have been started.
In the matter of starting bank loans, I've seen the gravity of the evil.
Even when they said that the priest could start the calculation, they have deposited 22,000 crores in it.
The bank department is also one of the major nutritions of economics.
These structures have reached the dragons.
In such a way the bank's bogus plan has been given a lot of nuisance.
Today 1.
25 lacs of bank robbers are coming to work.
Young people have been given job opportunities through this.
In the last decade, the department of bank, economic and economic cooperation has been working for providing financial education for a million fifteen thousand.
Do not stop this activity with the start of any bank deposits.
Now twelve thousands of people have been authorized overdraft due to their plans, taking it.
It's hoped that there's a bank loan for folks.
Once again, I'm telling all my life and appreciation related to it.
I'm pursuing everybody that don't ever touch your relationship with the bank.
Banks don't get away from yours, any kind of you.
We're taking the banks with your doors, don't leave it, hold it thick.
We've got to have money in all our bank accounts.
I'm unbelievable that you'll definitely do it.
It's a natural feeling that the last few days ago, the events that took place in Gujarat, the confrontation of the conflict, the entire confluence.
There was such a horrific incident in the birth soil of Gandhi, Sardar, and the people of the country caused deep sorrow and pain.
But within a very short period, the knowers of Gujarat, all the citizens of my Gujarat, sisters and sisters came under control of these conditions, have made sure to stop the situation and the worse.
Once again on a peaceful road the journey of Gujarat has begun .
Peace, loyalty, brotherhood - This way is right.
On the progressive road, we all have to travel with all the shoulders.
The progress can only make all our problems stronger.
In the past, the Sandurs of the Sufi-Pharmabreya were found to be a sympathetic riddle.
They've got a chance to hear goodness.
When they heard their words, it was like listening to a sweet music.
The meaning of the words they said, the style of communications.
I realized that the unique purpose of the Sufi tradition, the sweetness, the sweetness of the music, all these experiences are in the middle of these companions.
It was very fond of me.
It is very important to bring Islam to the world in the right eye.
I'm sure the sophisticated wealth of love, poverty, etc. will bring this message to all the ribs.
It's the beneficial of human society, and the welfare of Islam.
We may be a follower of other methods, but I'm asking everyone to understand the Sufi tradition.
I've got another chance during my arrival.
Buddhist sects from many countries of India come to Buddhist sects .
The world related to human society is arguing about the problem of depressed.
They're calling me to join it.
I only enjoy taking me to come to Buddha Gaya.
The first Prime Minister of India Jawahar Lal Nehru has reached Buddhist Gaya .
In this event of participating Buddhist monks from all over the world , I consider it to be proud .
My dear farmer brothers, once again I want to break my mind with you.
I've been dealing with you about this thing of my mind even before.
You might have heard the blackness of the mind, the general thread, and the court.
The government is in open mind in the issues related to the Land Registration Act.
I'm ready to accept any advice regarding the farmers' health, I've been telling it many ways.
If the village and the farmer's brother-in-law have to join the benefits of the brother-in-law of the village, if there is a construction of pirates with water in the fields, the electric components of the villages should be constructed in the villages, the villages should be provided for the livelihood comfort in the villages and the employment of the poor young people involved in the villages, then we should relieve the law from the problems of administration.
On the basis of these, all the suggestions have come to us from the States, I want to tell my agricultural sisters that they have been put in front of the curiosity.
But the misunderstandings are spreading.
Well, the farmers are roaming in the mind.
My farming brothers, don't fuck me, farmers, don't wanna be married.
I'm convinced that if someone guides you in the wrong way, as you're foolish, I'm sure we're not going to take any action in place of it.
Until ours, there is a value for every dweller of the country.
But the ideas of the farmers and the voices have a unique significance.
We brought a hurry legislation.
With the 31st day of August this obsessional legislation will be passed.
We're finally sure we can leave it empty.
What's with that
The same situation we were before we came to power is still round.
In the uncompromised, 13 things must be completed within Orand, we've done the obligation law.
But due to the formation of problems, it's not enough chicking.
The complication law is empty.
But the straightforward features of the farmers, the straight economic structures, etc., that 13 stories that we shaped into laws, are still suppressing it.
Through this, the farmers are assured not being financially damaged.
I'm telling my farmer's sisters that the words of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan are not mere words, but I'm sure it's a mantra.
The welfare of living farmers in the villages are in our hearts.
That's why I've been in my independent day's talk about not only the farming sector, but also the administration of agriculture and agricultural welfare.
We're going to move this decision quickly.
My farming brothers, don't you forget
If others try to seduce you, chick it, you don't want to be a victim.
I want to talk about another thing.
Two days ago, the war ended in 1965 and completed 50 years.
It's really a matter of reminding Lal Bahadur Sastri about them all we talk about the war in 1965.
Likewise, the words of Jai Jai Kisan will be remembered.
In order to protect the pride of the flame of India , the memories of the devils who sacrificed their innoys will also illuminate in our minds .
I'm supposed to demonstrate to everybody participating in the 1965 war. I'm sending my uncle to the warriors.
We have to get pregnancy continuously from such historical events.
In the past, however, Sufi had a luxurious experience of meeting the members of the family, spending many hours with the best scientists of the country.
I've got the chance to hear them.
I've been very happy.
In the scientific field, India has found many kinds of unique development.
Our scientists are actually making special progress.
We have to make efforts to bring their observations away from generations.
We have to see the progress of how the scientific principles should be rooted, how to lay down the observations of the test components.
I've got many new information.
It's based on me to prescribe and teach.
Many young scientists have shared a lot of things with me.
They've seen many dreams in my eyes.
Even in the chorus of the past, I told you that I should guide our students to science.
After this meeting, it was clear that there are many chances and occasions to be guided.
I want to talk to it again.
I have all student friends to enhance scientific dance.
Our educational structures should also imagine them in this direction.
I have many letters from the citizens.
They're mygov.
In the comprehensive gallery, the educational sector reforms are writing their views regarding competence.
Accumulated in the Siddambar region of Tamilnadu, Prakash Tribadi has written to me about the needs of good teachers in providing primary education and the improvement of educational institutions .
I've also spoken about my free day's talk about what is necessary for the determination of the lower work.
When the original election is invited, every poor family, the kind of mothers and the teachers are getting the paper, the help of someone who gets work, etc. is about to be waved.
This is also one of the reasons for the drainage in the edge.
I told you that there shouldn't be a determination test under a certain condition.
So, in the absence of 15 days, the government has come to see speedy progress in this direction, suggestions are being made, this decision will almost be fulfilled, I am very pleased to be tired of the method of determination of the lower level workers.
Don't run the fucking coffee, the tunnel's widening.
In today 's days there are colors of international frontiers coming to India.
24 countries of the world coordinated in collaboration with the call to activity of reducing the maternal mortality.
For the first time outside of America, this contemplation was started in India.
Every year only 50,000 mothers and 13 lakhs of children in our country will die after that.
It's messing, screaming.
There's something in this situation.
India's appreciations have also been received internationally.
Still, it's not possible to touch this guilt.
Just as we get rid of polio, we get rid of a reasonable tetanus for mother and child mortality.
It's accepted by the world.
But even today we have to save our mothers, save our children.
Brothers, in today's times, dengue is spreading.
The truth is that dengue fever is dangerous.
But it's very simple to get rid of it.
I want to talk about pure India is related to it.
Even if we see the advertisements on TV, we don't care about them.
We don't send our kids to them even if they're broadcasting the messages.
People are aware of matters like cleanliness , clean drinking water safety etc in small matters in homes .
Even though we don't show up in it.
We're staying in good houses, there are many facilities in it, but sometimes we don't know about the water roaming around us.
It's like calling for dengue fever.
I'm asking you not to bury this simple blanket for death.
Life is a very precious one.
It's not okay to pay attention to water logging, cleanliness, these are the calls for death, it's not right.
There are only 514 dengue fever detection centers across the country, where free tests are arranged.
Time testing, getting treatment is the only one for life's evacuation.
It's very important for your superior adventure in this matter.
It's very important to pay attention to cleanliness.
From the beginning of Raksha Bandhan till Deepavali the festivals and pavilions of our country will be filled .
Why shouldn't we connect all our plans with sacredness
Good records will be favourite, right
My dear folks, I'd like to share a happy message with you.
I don't know what the fucking country's life is.
But there's something that lives for the country, two brothers, youths, Das, affiliated to Nasik region of Maharashtra.
Hidendra Mahajan, Da.
In the minds of Mahendra Mahajan Sarkar our folk tribes are well-known .
These two brothers have gained great respect for India.
The name of race cross Amrica in America is only 4,800 km.
Me.
Magnificent, a difficult cycle is going on.
This year, these two brothers have succeeded in this bond, have proud India.
I'm telling these two brothers my life and my appreciation.
But they're busy bringing attention to the welfare of the tribes of Team Andia, Vision for Tribals.
Look, how everybody's progressively coming to share,
When you're questioning about such possibilities, the sweetness grows in greatness.
Sometimes, because of the mirror, we're slaughtering injustice to our younger communities.
A new television doesn't know at all.
I believe this move has been for many centuries.
But my experience was unavoidable to the younger community.
Sometimes when you talk to the youngsters, we can also learn many things.
I've met many young men who decide that Sudy on Cycle is riding on Sundays.
Some people come back to the cycle day in the week that I'm going to travel in the bike.
They say that it is good for my health, beneficial for the environment, the happiness that I am young.
Cycl clubs are running in many cities of our country.
There's also a lot of imagination for the journey of bikes.
It's a good endeavor for health, environmental health.
As the two youths of India have achieved the pride of the country , the vision of the youth of the country is also worth mentioning .
Especially, I'd like to tell the Maharashtra government my lives.
The memorial of Baba Saheb Ambatkar in the Hindu Mills area of Mumbai has come from starvation for a long time .
This work has been completed by the new government of Maharashtra .
In that place, a special, beautiful, preserving memories of Baba Saheb Ambethgar will be raised.
It's working for low, impaired, deprived, repeated people.
Not only this, the house of Baba Saheb Ambatkar in London, 10, king Henry Road, has now been bought for a price.
While traveling around the world to Indians going to London, there is a memorial of Baba Saheb Ambatgar established by the Maharashtra government.
The Maharaja state government, which is trying to make these two memorials built by Baba Saheb Ambatkar as a gathering of honor and admiration and admiration.
My dear brothers, before the next voice sounds, you must tell me your ideas.
I have a strong faith in the development of the country only when everyone joins the skin and joins the skin.
Thank you, very good for me.
