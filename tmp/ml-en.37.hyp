Prime Minister Mr.
On the 31st January 2016, the Tamilnadu language of the special launch conducted by the Akashwani to the Indian population at 11 a.m.
My dear countrymen
This is the first 'Man Ki Bath' program in 2016.
'Man Ki Bath' is very close to me.
If something's too much, if you care, you understand a new idea, it seems to be a part of you.
Yesterday I went to Rajghat to offer honors to the composer Bapuji.
It's a year-long program to invite the martyrs.
It's the occasion of expressing respect for the heroes for the great Magadh, who sacrificed life for the people who shot their lives for the country at 11 o'clock.
But if we look at it, we'll have a lot of people who don't do this.
You don't think it's part of our habit.
We must see this as our national responsibility.
I know it's not going to walk with me just a mankie bath.
But what I thought yesterday could share it with you.
It's what makes us inspiration to live for the country.
You imagine.
Every year on January 30, at 11 o'clock, hundred and fifty million people of the country celebrate their silence for two minutes.
You imagine how strong it is.
It's okay with our sciences.
Intelligent sympathy, Vomnamsy Janatam is moving together, speaking together, our mind is united.
This is the power of the country.
It's such a thing that gives life to this power.
Dear countrymen
I was reading the ideas of Sardar Patel a few days ago.
And then I noticed some things.
I liked one thing in that.
Sardar Patel has said about Khadi - India's freedom is in treasure.
The culture of Hindustan is also in Khadi.
Ahimsa is also in Khadi, considered to be the religion of Hindustan.
And the greatness of the peasants of Hindustan is in Khadi.
It's with these farmers that we have so much affection.
Sardar Patel was a simple person in a simple language.
He's very beautifully saying Khadi's greatness.
I tried to get involved in the letters of the priest on January 30, how much they could be connected to Khadi and rural hub industries.
As I was a priest who supported the poetry, I used technology and tried to connect millions of such siblings through this technique.
Khadi has become a symbol now.
It's marked.
Khadi is now turning into an attraction for the younger moon.
Especially whoever shows Chaiva to Vihesheshara Damahave Ramrila La and biological territory, is an excellent way for them.
Khadi has gained a position as a fashion.
I appreciate the people who work with Khadi for the refreshment of Khadi.
In the economy, the Campaign has its own importance.
Khadi has to find a place of vitality to find a place in the camp.
I told the people that if there are different types of cottons with you, then I'm gonna be khadi.
This thing has been accepted by the people.
Well, it can't be a treasure, but if there are ten types of clothes, one can be another.
But with this, the government is developing a favourable environment in the head.
A lot of years ago, the government had used enough khadi on the floor.
But it was going to end in the name of New Ma.
At the same time, our poor people associated with Khadi were becoming employless.
Khadi has the ability to employ millions of people.
In the past, the Ministry of Railways, the Police Department, the Indian Civil Services, the Tapal Department of Uttarakhand has begun to encourage the use of many government institutions such as Khadi.
They have informed me that for those who work in the Khadi area as a result of these types of efforts of government departments, specially 18 lakh job days will be created to complete the needs of the government.
18 lakhs of jobs will make a big fucking shit.
He was very careful about the composite bapu and technology cultivation, he wanted it too much.
That's how our skin grew up and reached here.
Nowadays, it is a successful experiment to activate skin with solar energy and connect the solar energy to the skin.
That's why Advanced production grows less.
There's been a qualitative change.
Especially people send me a lot of letters for the solar skull.
From Dausa in Rajasthan, Geeta Devi, Komal Devi and Sadhana Devi have written to me from Nawada district of Bihar - there have been major changes in our life due to solar skin.
Our income is double.
Not only this, the need for the people is increasing with our noole.
These things create a new excitement.
On 30 January, when I recall Babaji, I repeat again, let me have one khadi in your harvest collection.
Let's seem to be a hurry.
Dear countrymen, on the celebrated day of January 26, we celebrated very warmth and enthusiasm.
In the midst of the fear of what the terrorists will do in the country, people celebrated the festival of courage and courage and pride and glory and democracy.
But some people did something different.
I wish it should be careful.
Especially Haryana, Gujarat States have done a very new experiment.
This year, they chose the most advanced girls in the village for flag hoisting in every village government school.
Haryana and Gujarat gave special importance to learned girls.
They tried to give a great message to save mothers and teach daughters.
I appreciate the imagination power of both the states and the girls who have the chances of flagship and flagship.
There was one more thing in Haryana.
In the last one year, in which families girls were born, such families were specially invited on 26th January.
I.
P.
They were given their place on the front line in the form of arts.
It was a very proud moment.
I started my plan 'Betty Bachao Beti Pathao' in Haryana, so I'm very happy.
The linga ratio was totally broken in Haryana.
It was very horrible that when thousands of boys were born, the number of girls was less than that.
Social balance was a dangerous situation.
When I was interested in Haryana, the officials told me, "No, sir, don't start there, there's a very negative atmosphere.
But I went ahead with my goal.
Today, I appreciate Hariyan as a heart attack.
They've seen it in their own way.
Not only that, there's a big deal in the girls' birth rate.
Last time, in Man Ki Bati, I told you two things.
One, why don't we fix the idols of great men as a citizen
We show a lot of consciousness about the establishment of the idol.
But we don't go to them later.
Another thing, I said, "How do we finish our duty on Republic Day"
What do you want to discuss the rituals
I've already discussed the rights.
This discussion will continue.
But do you have to discuss the actions
Christians came forward in many parts of the country.
Social organisations came forward.
The educational organizations came forward.
Many saints and humble men came forward.
I'm very happy to shoot all the statues where they are.
It started a good thing.
This isn't just a pure mission.
And respect.
I don't mean anything special.
But the news received is pleasant.
Some might not complicate the news.
I'd like to tell them, send the picture of the idol you've done to the uiet urmeha.
Let the world be proud to see it.
In the same way, on 26th January, I was convinced by the people about 'charities and rights'.
I'm very happy that thousands of people participated in it.
My dear countrymen, I need your help in one thing.
I believe you'll help me.
In our country, there are many things for the farmers.
I don't want to be discrepancies.
But the greatest sadness of the farmers is losing their entire study in the nature of illusion.
They're lost for a year.
A plan to protect them is the Planning Insurance Plan.
In 2016, the biggest gift of Indians to the farmers is 'Prime Minister Glory Insurance Policy'.
But it doesn't mean to receive the Prime Minister's pleasure for praise or appreciation.
There have been discussions about call insurance for years.
But the farmers who have more than 20-25 percent of the country have not been able to avail it.
They couldn't be connected to it.
Can we imagine that within one or two years, at least 50 percent of the farmers in the country can be linked to the crop insurance policy
That's why I need your help.
Because connecting the crops with insurance will help in misery.
The Prime Minister's Planning Insurance Policy has received great acceptance from the people because of being more popular this time.
It's very simple.
Technicals are also included.
Not only this, after 15 days of warming, there will be help in any accident.
By using technology, it has taken care of all the things that do not delay the insurance amount.
Otherwise, the cost of the Policy Premium of Planning Insurance has been determined below the farmer's thinking.
In the new polysis, the high rate of premi for farmers is 2 percent for spring yield.
It's 5 percent.
Now, if I don't know any of my peasants, would he have a great loss or not
You're not a farmer, but I'm listening to 'Man Ki Bath'.
Didn't you bring this to the farmers
That's why I want you to inspire it.
For this, I have brought you a new plan this time.
I want to reach more people about the Prime Minister's Call Insurance Policy.
T.
It's true that you're listening to my 'Man Ki Bath' program in Vi and Radio.
But if you couldn't hear it later
Now I'm going to give you a new gift.
You can hear my 'Man Ki Bath' program in your mobile phone
At any time.
That's all you do.
Do a missed call, from your mobile phone.
A number for Manki Bati has been decided.
81908 81908.
When you missed, you can hear 'Man Ki Bath' anytime after that.
In fact, this system is only in Hindi.
But very soon you'll get a chance to hear 'Man Ki Bath' in your mother tongue.
There are arrangements for that.
My dear young men, you surprised me.
When the start of the Startup program began on 16th January, a new energy, a new cosmo, a new excitement were found in the country's young people.
Lacs of people registered to come to that program.
But finally the Vigyan Bhavan performed the program due to the destination.
Maybe you couldn't have reached.
But you'll be part of the whole time as an online.
Perhaps, a program would have been making millions of young people unconstitutional for so long.
But it happened.
I was watching.
Start-up was so excited.
But, one thing, Startup, but I.
T.
Community's thinking is related.
It's a very important job area.
Start-up got a mistake after Evant.
I.
T.
Start-up attached to x is only a small part.
Life is huge.
The requirements are infinite.
Start-up brings countless opportunities.
I went to Sikkim a few days ago.
Sikkim is now an organic state of the country.
I invited all the agricultural ministers and agricultural secretaries to the country.
I got a chance to meet two young men there.
They were Agarwal and Siddhi Karna who studied in Kakang.
They work in the vegetarian bio-electrical zones in the north-eastern states.
It deals with the global level.
Last time, I told the people associated with Start-App to send their experiences to Narendra Modi Application.
A lot of people have been sent.
But I'll be glad if you come more.
But it's really inspiring.
The young man of faith, Dwivedi, who is doing online kitchen start-up.
Medieval people who work sub-divisional work, they work for lunch through online.
Danesh Pathak has prepared a mental work for the farmers, especially in the field of swimming.
If our country's cattle get better food, we'll get good milk.
If we get good milk, our youngster will become stronger.
Manoj Gilda, Nikhilji etc. started start-up in cartridges.
They are developing a wide synthesis of fruits for scientific resources.
It means there's a lot of opinion.
I'll be very happy to send you more opinions.
I have to talk about Startup at Manki Bati sometimes.
I'll tell you about Start-App, as I say every time about purifying.
Because your excitement is our inspiration.
My dear people, purifying is now close to beauty.
We've been fighting for years against unconsciousness.
But it doesn't have enough results.
Now people are talking about purifying.
There's some hypothesis somewhere.
But now people have gone a step further.
They're synonymous with purifying.
It's like a smell of gold.
Especially now it's common at railway stations.
In these days, I see the local artists, local artists and students of the country actively interfering in the separation of railway stations in their city.
On the basis of local art, painting on the walls, making the signboards properly, introducing messages that make people aware.
Someone told me that the tribal women there at Hazaribagh station decorated the entire station with the design of local art Sohrai and Kohbar.
Thousands of compassionate workers in Thane district have stolen King Circle Station.
Such works were carried out in Matunga, Boriville and Khar.
A lot of news from Rajasthan is coming in this way.
Sawai Madhopur, Kota etc. will be there.
I think the railway stations might be marked by our tradition.
Everyone will not be looking for those who sell tea and bits through the windows of the train.
The specialty of that place can be spread on the walls by sitting on the train.
It's not the initiative of the railway.
Moni's not initiative.
It's citizens.
Look how citizens work when they work.
But I'm looking for some pictures I got.
He's squeezing to see more pictures.
Would you send them to me if somebody tried to enjoy the beauty with purifying them at the railway stations or others
Sure, I'll take care of anyone.
People will see it.
Others will be inspired.
Can be done at railway stations on bus stations.
Such beauty activities can be done in the premises of hospitals, schools, temples, mosques.
This can be done in parks and gardens.
It has a lot of potential.
Thinks like this, they started and appreciated those who took it forward.
But you must send me a photo.
I also want to see what you did.
It is very proud that my dear folks, from 4th to 8th of the first week of February, India makes a guest of a very big conference.
The whole world is going to be our guests.
Our Navy continues to enjoy an encouraging commitment to that guest.
Warships in many countries of the world, ships of Navy, etc. are going to Sammelhi on the seashore of Visakhapattanam in Andhra Pradesh.
The International Fleet Review is going on the Indian Ocean.
A chance to accompany the world's power and our forces.
It's a combination.
In the coming days, you have T.
V.
The media will get news and other details about it.
Because it's a big event.
Everyone's helping to do it.
It's a big deal about a country like India.
India has a golden sea surrounding.
Sanskrit is the source of the sea, the Sagar.
It means infinite emotion.
The borders may have been different from us.
Places may be connected to us.
But the water conjure us.
The ocean unites us.
We'll be with us through the sea.
Anybody can have a relationship.
Our ancestors, before the centuries, used to prove that power by traveling and trading.
It would be Chhatrapati Shivaji, in the Chola empire, they made a recognition about the maritime power.
Even today, there are many traditions related to the ocean in many of our states.
There are many festivals in the form of festival.
When the world is India's guest, the power of the Navy is known.
It's a good chance.
I and I will be able to share this world's event.
At the eastern end of India a sports festival is celebrated in Guwahati .
SARK countries' sports festival.
Thousands of sportsmen from SARC countries are coming to the soil of Guwahati.
The atmosphere of the game, the excitement of the game, is going on in the soil of Guwahati in Assam, a food festival of the Great Stone of Sirk Countries.
This is also a good opportunity to connect with our SARC countries.
My dear folks, in the beginning, I'm telling you what I want to understand.
Ten and eleven class examinations are going on in the coming days.
Last time, in Man Ki Bati, I spoke to the students about the exams.
This time there's an arrow.
Successful students, how did they end in the exams, there was a calm atmosphere in the houses and your experience of what the graduates and the teachers did and what they did to you and the elders who told them what they said.
We'll do one thing this time.
If you send me your experience to the Nirendramodi Application.
I'll ask the media to propagate them through their media in the months of February March.
That's why the students of the country read it and TV.
We'll see Ville.
So, they'll get the medicines that can play and smile and try how they are unconscious, unconscious.
I believe my media friends will help me in this.
If you send it to me, you can help the media.
Can't you send me
Of course, send it.
Thank you very much, you'll see the next month for Man Ki Bati again.
Thank you very much.
