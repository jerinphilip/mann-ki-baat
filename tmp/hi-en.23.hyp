Talking to the mind, March 2017, my dear countrymen, greet you all
Most families in every corner of the country will be engaged in their children ' s eam
Those whose eam has been lost, there will be some relief and where Yeam runs, there will still be a little pressure in those families
But at such a time I will say that listen to the things I have done to the students in the matter of the last time, those things will definitely work at the time of the exam
Today is 26th March .
March 26 is the Independence Day of Bangladesh .
A historic battle against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Banga-Bandhu
On this important day of today, I give great good wishes to the citizens of Bangladesh to the Independence Day
And I wish Bangladesh move forward, develop and I assure Bangladeshi people that India is a strong partner of Bangladesh, is a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development within this entire region by mixing shoulders.
We all are proud that Tagore, his memories, we have a shared heritage
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first Asian person to receive the Nobel (Nobel ) award but also gave him the title of Knighthood by the British .
And when the British slaughtered at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Ravindranath Tagore was among the great men who raised their voices and this was a period, when a 12-year-old child had a deep impact on this incident
The brutal massacre of Jallianwala Bagh gave a new inspiration to the child laughing at farming in adolescence .
And in 1919, the 12-year-old boy Bhagat, the inspiration of all of us - Shaheed Bhagat Singh
Three days before today, Bhagat Singh ji and his companion, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that incident of March 23 - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru's face was not afraid of serving Ma-Bharti - There was no fear of death
All the dreams of life were contained for the freedom of mother and Indian
And these three braves are still inspiration for all of us .
We will not be able to decorate the saga of sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words
And the whole British Sultanate was afraid of these three youths .
The prison was closed, the hanging was fixed, but how to move forward with them, the British used to worry about it.
And then it was to be hanged on March 24, but it was given on March 23 only
Was done with theft, which is not usually done
And after bringing his body to Punjab today, the British quietly burned
Many years ago, when I got the chance to go there for the first time, I felt a kind of vibration in that earth
And I will definitely say to the youth of the country - Whenever there is a chance, whenever Punjab goes, then go to Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Mataji of Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt's tomb
This was the time when the flame of freedom, his intensity, his extension continued to grow
On one side the heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru had inspired the youth for the Armed Revolution
So hundred years ago today - April 10 , 1917 - Mahatma Gandhi had done Champaran Satyagraha .
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha .
In the movement of India's independence, Gandhi thought and Gandhi style, its appearance first appeared in Champaran
It was a turning point in the entire movement of freedom, especially in terms of conflict
This was the period, the Satyagraha of Champaran, Kheda Satyagraha, the strike of mill workers in Ahmedabad, and the deep influence of Mahatma Gandhi's idea and style of functioning was seen in all these.
In 1915 , Gandhi returned from abroad and in 1917 , visiting a small village in Bihar , gave a new inspiration to the country .
Today, on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi, we can not evaluate Champaran Satyagraha
Imagine that a person who came back to India in 1915, only two years of tenure
Neither did the country know them, nor did their effect, it was just the beginning
We can guess how hard they have to suffer at that time
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that in which Mahatma Gandhi's organization skill, Mahatma Gandhi's power to know the pulse of Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi, with his behavior, poorly in front of the British Sultanate, organizing an uneducated person for the struggle, motivating, bringing it to the ground for the struggle, it shows the wonderful power
And so as we feel the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi
But if you think of Gandhi hundred years ago, Gandhi with that Champaran Satyagraha, then Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of very much study for any person starting public life.
How can public life be started, how much work has to be done and how Gandhi did it, we can learn from them
And that was the time, as we hear the names of big leaders, Gandhi should be Rajendra Babu at that time, Acharya Kripalani ji, sent everyone to the villages
By joining people, people who are working, gave color to the color of freedom - taught its methods
And the British couldn ' t understand what this is Gandhi ' s style
The struggle also went, the creation also went and both of them went together
Like Gandhi made two sides of a coin, one aspect of a coin struggle, then another aspect creation
To fill the prison on one side, on the other hand, spend yourself in creative work
A big wonderful balance was in the style of Gandhi .
What is the word satyagraha, what can be disagreement, what is non-cooperation in front of such a big supremacy - a complete new destruction Gandhi did not by words, was introduced by a successful experiment
Today, when the country is celebrating the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha, then how immense is the power of the common man of India, like the movement of freedom, the journey of Suraj from Swaraj, the determination power of hundreds of millions of countrymen, the culmination of hard work, "Sarvajan Hittay" by taking this original mind, for the country, for the society, the unbroken effort of doing something will fulfill the dreams of those great men who die for freedom"
Today, when we are living in the 21st century, who will be this, who will not want to change India, who will be Hindustani, who does not want to be a partner for change in the country
The desire for this change of hundreds of millions of countrymen, this is an attempt to change, which is the new India, New Year
Endia, it'll put its strong foundation
New I
India is neither a government program nor a political party's maniesto nor is it a project
New I
India is the call of hundreds of millions of people
This is the feeling that how many hundred crore people want to make a grand India together .
There is hope within the minds of hundreds of millions of countrymen, there is an excitement, a resolution, a desire
My dear countrymen, if we look at the ongoing activities in society with a sensitivity (complicated sensitivity) from our personal life, we will try to understand what is happening next to us, then we will be surprised that lakhs of people with selflessness, for the society, for the exploited and oppressed, for the poor, somewhat looks for the miseries.
And they do, like a silent servant, as they do penance, they keep doing
There are many people who go to the hospital everyday, help patients
Many people run to donate blood as soon as they know
There are many people, someone is hungry, then worry about his food
Our country is multicultural .
The Lord-Service, it's in our veils
If once we look at him as a collective, see in an organized form, then how big is this power
When New ID
India is a matter of criticism, to be discussed, to see it differently, it is very natural and it is inevitable in democracy
But it is true that if hundreds of millions of countrymen resolve, decide the path to prove the resolution, let's take one step, then New VIDEO
The dream of hundreds of millions of people can be proved in front of our eyes .
And it is not necessary that all these things happen from the budget, government is from the project, government funds
If every citizen resolves that I follow the rules of traic, if every citizen resolves that I will fulfill my responsibility with full sincerity, if every citizen resolves that one day I will not use the petrol-diecell in my life
Things are small .
You see this country, which New Year
India's dream is seeing hundreds of millions of people, they will be able to see the reality in front of their eyes
The meaning of saying is that every citizen follows his citizen's religion, follows the duty
This is the New ID itself
Can become a good start of ndia
Come, 2022 - India's independence is going to be 75 years
Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, remember Rajguru, remember Satyagraha of Champaran
So why don't we also add "Swaraj" by disciplining our life in this journey of Suraj"
I invite you Come on
My dear countrymen, I want to express your gratitude today
In the last few months, there was an atmosphere in our country, a large number of people participated in the digital payment movement
Without cash transactions, its curiosity has also increased, it is also trying to learn poorly and gradually people are moving forward without doing cash business.
Since the demonetization notebook, there has been a lot of increase in different methods of digital payment .
BI
It has just been two-and-a-half months since it started, but nearly 1.5 million people have downloaded it so far.
My dear countrymen, black money, fight against corruption, we have to move forward
Can hundreds of million people resolve to work for two and a half million digital transactions in this one year
We have announced in the budget
If they want these work for hundreds of millions of people, they can not wait for one year, in six months
Two and a half million digital transactions, if we fill in the school, we will not fill it with cash, we will fill it with digital, we will migrate in the railway, payment from digital, we will buy medicines, digital payments, we run cheap grain shops, we will do the digital system
We can do this in everyday life
You do not imagine, but you can serve the country a lot and you can become a hero soldier against black money, corruption
For public education in the past several programs have been organized for public awareness .
There is a resolution to do 100 programmes across the country
80-85 programs have been done
There was also a prize plan .
Nearly twelve and a half million people have received this reward of consumers
70 thousand people have received the reward for traders
And everyone has resolved to pursue this work
On 14th April Dr . Baba Saheb is the birth centre of Ambedkar .
And as it was decided long ago, on 14th April Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary this digit fair is going to end .
It ' s going to be a very big programme for a hundred days .
There is also a provision of a very big draw
I am confident that as much time as Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth-Jayanti is left to us, CBI
We propagate M-APP
How to reduce cash, how to reduce the behavior of notes, we contribute to it
My dear countrymen, I am happy that every time, whenever I ask people for suggestions, there are many suggestions
But I have seen that there is always an insistence on sanitation .
I am from Dehradun, a bitia named Gayatri, who is 11th student, has sent a message by phone: - Advanced Principal, Prime Minister, you my mother-in-law
First of all , you ' ve promised that you have won by heavy votes in this election .
I want to talk to you about my mind .
I want to say that people have to explain how cleanliness is necessary
I get through that river everyday, in which people put a lot of garbage and contaminate the rivers
The river comes through the Rispana bridge and comes to my house .
For this river we also took out a rally by going to the settlements and talked to the people, but there was no benefit from it.
I want to tell you to expose this by sending one of your teams or through the newspaper, thank you
"Look, brother-in-law, how much is the pain of a daughter of class 11"
How angry is he looking at garbage in that river
I consider it a good sign .
That's what I want, there is anger against dirt in the minds of hundreds of millions of people
Once anger will arise, anger will arise, anger will arise against him, we will start doing something against dirt
And the good thing is that Gayatri himself is expressing his anger, giving me suggestions, but at the same time, he is also saying that he did a lot of effort, but failed
Since the movement of cleanliness has started, awareness has come
Everyone has been positively connected to it
He has also taken the form of a movement .
The hate of dirt is also increasing
Be awareness, active participation, movement, it has its own importance
But hygiene is more associated with the movement .
This movement is a movement to change habit, this movement is a movement to create a habit of cleanliness, the movement can be collectively
Work is difficult, but I do
I believe that in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students, in the youth, this feeling that has awakened, it indicates the good results in itself.
Whatever is listening to Gayatri in my mind today, I will tell all the people that the message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I'm talking about "Mann" program, I have been receiving many suggestions on one thing from the beginning and that most people have expressed concern about Food Wastage I
We know that we take more plates in family and even in collective food functions .
All the things that appear, fill in all the flats and then do not eat I
Half of the plate fills in the stomach and then leaves it there and I
You've ever thought how ruined we do with what we leave this shoe
Have you ever thought that if you do not leave the shoe, then how many poor people can fill the stomach I
This is not the subject to explain .
Well when the mother serves small children in our family, she says, take as much as the son can eat, I
Some effort continues, but still apathy on this subject is a sociologist I
Injustice with poor ID
Second, if saving, then the family also has economic benefits ID
Think for society, it is a good thing, but this is the subject that the benefit of the family is also VIDEO
I'm not insisting on this subject, but I'd like to increase this awareness.
I know some youths who run such agitations have created Mobile App and there is such a shoe anywhere, people call, they all collect and use it, work hard and only the youth of our own country do I
You will find such people somewhere in every state of India
Their life can also inspire people that we do not join .
We take as much food as I
Look, this is the way I have to change
And those who are aware of body health, they always say - keep your stomach a little, keep the plate a little loose
And when it comes to health, then on April 7 is World Health Day, World Health Day Day I
United Nations has set the target of health to all by 2030 .
This time nited nations have occupyed the topic on April 7 World Health Day
Depression this is their theme of this time I
We are also familiar with the word Depression, but if literally means, then some people call him depression.
One estimate is that more than 35 million people in the world are mentally, I
The trouble is that we do not understand this even in our neighborhood and perhaps we hesitate to talk openly about this matter.
The person who feels himself does not speak anything, because he feels a little embarrassment.
I would like to say to the countrymen that the expression is not that it cannot get rid of
A psychological environment has to be created and it begins .
The first mantra is, instead of the perspression of Epression, its appreciation requires ID
Between your companions, between friends, between parents, between brothers, with Teacher, openly say what's happening to you
Sometimes the children living in the hostel of loneliness becomes more difficult ID
The good fortune of our country has been that we grew up in a joint family, there is a huge family, there is a mixture and because of this, the possibility of appreciation ends, but still I would like to say to my parents that you have ever seen your son or daughter or any member of the family - first when you used to eat food, everyone used to eat, but a family person - he says - No, I will eat later - he does not come to Table I
Everyone in the house is going out somewhere, then says - no-no, I do not want to come today - I like to stay alone
You have ever noticed why it does .
You must assume that it ' s the first step of the direction of Epression I
If he does not like to live in a group from you, walking alone in a corner, then try to see that it does not happen.
Give him an opportunity to stay in the middle with those who talk openly with him
Talking about laughing and laughing, inspire him to expresciate, what frustration has happened inside him, get him out of the ID
It ' s the best way
And expression becomes the cause of mental and physical diseases
Like Diabetes becomes a believer of all kinds of diseases, eppression also destroys all our capabilities, fighting, courage, deciding.
Your friend, your family, your premises, your environment - they can stop you from going to expresion and go, then you can bring it out.
There ' s another way I
If you can not open your expression in between yourselves, do one thing, go to help people with some service in the next.
Help me, share their happiness and sorrow, you see, the pain within you will erase the same way.
If you try to understand their misery, you will serve, there will be a new confidence in you.
By joining others, serving someone, and if you serve with selflessness, you can lighten your burden very easily
However , Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy .
Relief from stress, freedom from pressure, prayana towards happy mind - Yoga helps a lot
June 21 is International Yoga Day I
This will be the third year I
You should also prepare from now and celebrate the collective yoga festival of millions .
If there is any suggestion in your mind regarding the third International Yoga Day, then you must send me your suggestion through my mobile application, guide me
As many songs as you can prepare poetic compositions in relation to yoga, they should do so that people understand easily
I would like to talk to mothers and sisters today, because today the talk of health has come out enough, health is very good.
So the Government of India has made a major decision in the past .
The workers class women in our country, who are our women in the working class and their number is increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and they are welcome, but at the same time, women also have special responsibility
They handle family responsibilities, the economic responsibility of the house also has to be done by him and due to this sometimes it becomes injustice to the newborn baby.
Government of India has made a very big decision
These working classes are women, they will be given 26 weeks at the time of delivery, during pregnancy, during delivery, Maternity Leave which was first 12 weeks, now I
There are probably two or three countries in the world, which are ahead of us I
India has made a very important decision for these sisters .
And its original purpose is to take care of that newborn baby, future citizen of India, take proper care of her in the early part of birth, she gets a lot of love, then our children will grow up and become the country's inhuman
Mother ' s health will also be good and this is a very important decision .
And due to this , nearly 18 lakh women working in the formal sector will get the benefit ID
My dear countrymen, on April 5 is the holy festival of Ramnavmi, on April 9, Mahavir Jayanti is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on April 14
The life of all these great men has been inspiring us, New VIDEO
Enjoy the will for ndia
After two days, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, Nava Sanvatsar, give you a lot of good wishes for this new year.
This is the time for farmers to get fruits after the spring season .
This new year is celebrated differently in different corners of our country.
In Maharashtra, Gudi-Padwa, Andhra-Karnataka as a new year, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Sanvatsar Pooja in the area of Awadh, Mithila in Bihar and Satwani festival in Magadha happens on New Year
Countless, India is a country full of such diversity IV
