Talking to the mind, September 2018, my dear countrymen, greetings
There can hardly be an Indian who is not proud of our armed forces
Whether every Indian is in any area, caste, religion, creed or language - always willing to express and support our soldiers
Tomorrow, hundreds of millions of people of India celebrated Parakram festival
We recalled the surgical strike in 2016 when our soldiers gave a torment to those who drive the proy war under the guise of terrorism on our nation .
Our armed forces at different places in the country put ehibitions so that more and more citizens of the country, especially young and young people can know what our strength is .
How capable we are and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by risking our lives
A day like the Parakram festival reminds the youth of the glorious heritage of our armed forces .
And inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country
I also participated in a program in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of the heroes, now it has been decided that our soldiers will give a torment to all those who will try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our nation
We believe in peace and are committed to promoting it, but by compromising with respect and not at the cost of sovereignty of the nation
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace
In the 20th century, more than one lakh soldiers gave their highest sacrifice to peace in two world wars and this was when we had nothing to do with that war
We never saw anyone else on earth .
It was our commitment to peace .
On September 23, a few days ago, when we completed hundred years of Laia's fight in Israel, we remembered our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lancers who had liberated Daia from the invaders
It was also a feat by our soldiers towards peace .
Even today India is one of the most military sending countries in different peacekeeping forces of nited nations .
Our brave soldiers have played an important role in keeping peace in the world wearing blue helmets for decades
My dear countrymen, the things of the sky are unique, it is not surprising that the Indian Air Force has drawn the attention of every country by introducing its power in the sky.
We have realized security
During the Republic Day celebrations , one of the most eager parts of the parade is Ly Past in which our Air Force demonstrates its power with surprising exploits
On October 8 , we celebrate the Air Force Day .
In 1932 , with six pilots and 19 air soldiers , our Air Force has joined the most adventurous and powerful Air Force of the 21st century .
This is a memorable journey in itself
I appreciate all the Air Warriors and their families who served for the country in depth of my heart
In 1947 , when Pakistan ' s attackers started an unexpected attack , it was the Air Force who ensured that Indian troops and equipment would reach the battlefield .
In 1965 , the Air Force gave the enemies a torment .
Who does not know the battle for Bangladesh in 1971
The role of the Air Force has also been important in relieving Kargil intruders .
Air Force dumped them by bombarding night and day in enemy bases in Tiger Will
Relief and rescue work or disaster management , our Air Warriors are grateful to the IAF about their commendable work .
His torture has been amazing to deal with the natural calamity of floods, floods to forest fire and help the countrymen
In order to ensure equality of gender quality i . e . women and men in the country , Air Force has set an example and has opened the doors of each of its departments for the daughters of the country .
Now , the Air Force is giving women the option of entertainment with short serve commission and which I had announced on August 15 this year .
India can proudly say that not only male power in the armed forces in the Indian army, but also the contribution of women and power is becoming equally contributing.
Women are strong, now armed too
My dear countrymen, in the past, Navi's official Abhilash Tommy was fighting for his life and death
The whole country was worried about how to save Tommy .
You know Abhilash Tommy is a very brave officer
They were the first Indian to visit the world by taking a small boat without any modern technology alone
For the last 80 days, he was moving forward while maintaining his speed in the sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean, but the horrific sea storm created trouble for him but this naval of India continued to struggle for several days between the heroic sea
He kept fighting without eating and drinking in water
I didn ' t lose my life
A wonderful example of courage, determination, power, power - a few days ago when I saved the desire from the sea, I talked on the telephone
I had met Tommy before
Even after coming out of such a crisis, his courage was to do something like this and once he told me that he is inspiration for the younger generation of the country.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tommy and their courage, their power, their determination power - and the power to win, will definitely inspire the younger generation of our country
My dear countrymen, on October 2, what is the importance of this day for our nation, kid and kid know it
This year has a special significance on 2nd October .
For two years now , we are going to perform various programmes worldwide under the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi .
Mahatma Gandhi ' s idea has inspired the whole world
Mr. Martin uther King Junior or great figures like Nelson Mandela, everyone got power from Gandhiji's ideas and fought long to give their people the right to equality and respect
In today's "mind", I want to discuss another important work of worshipping Bapu with you, which more and more countrymen should know"
In the last one, in 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as Constructive Programme i.e. creative program
Later in 1945, when the freedom struggle caught the emphasis, he prepared a revised copy of that idea
Pooja Bapu has kept his views in front of the countrymen on many subjects like protecting the rights of farmers, villages and workers, cleanliness and spreading education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter .
Pooja Bapu was a folk collector .
It was Bapu's specialty to join people and join them, it was in his nature
Everyone has experienced this as the most unique feature of his personality
He realised everybody that it was the most important and absolutely necessary for the country .
His biggest contribution in the freedom struggle was that he made it a mass movement .
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi in the movement of freedom struggle, people of every section of society dedicated themselves
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra which is often known as Gandhiji's Talisman
Gandhiji had said in it, "I give you a generator, whenever you doubt or your ego begin to dominate you, try this criterion, remember the form of the poorest and weakest man you have seen and ask your heart how much you think of taking steps will be useful for that man"
Will he get some benefit
Can he control his own life and his fate
Is it possible to get Swaraj to millions of people whose stomach is hungry and the soul is insomnia
Then thou shalt see that thy doubt is erasing , and the grief is over .
A Jantar ji of my dear countrymen, Gandhiji is equally important today
Increasing middle class in the country today, its growing economic power, increasing performance power, can we remember Bapu for a moment if we go for shopping anything
Bapu can remember that Jantar .
What citizens of my country will benefit from what I am buying while we can think of shopping .
Whose face will be pleased
Who will be lucky whose direct or indict will benefit from your purchase
And if poverty benefits poorly, my pleasure will be more and more
Recalling this Jantar ji of Gandhiji, whenever we buy something in the days to come, we celebrate Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary, then we must see that any countryman should be good in every purchase and who has shed his sweat, who has spent his money, who has spent his talent, they should have some benefits.
This is Gandhi's Jantar, this is the message of Gandhi and I am sure that the poorest and the weakest man can bring a small step in his life very big result
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji had said that you will get freedom
Perhaps they will not even know how this would happen - but this happened, India got freedom
Likewise, today, we may feel that even in the economic advancement of my country from this small task, in economic empowerment, I can contribute to the poor to fight against poverty and I think that this is the true patriotism of today's age, this is the duty of worshipping Bapu
Think about buying Khadi and handloom products on special occasions, this will help many weavers
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastri used to comfort the old or cut garments of Khadi because somebody 's hard work is hidden in it .
They said that all these khadi clothes were made with great hard work - one yarn should be used for this .
This feeling of attachment to the country and love with the countrymen was composed in the rugs of that great man with small stature .
Two days later , along with Bapu , we will celebrate Shastri ' s birth anniversary .
As Shastri ' s name comes , we have a sense of unlimited faith in the minds of the Indians .
His gentle personality always fills every country with pride .
Lal Bahadur Sastry ' s specialty was that he looked very humble from outside , but he was determined to be firm like a rock from within .
'Jai Jawan Jai Kisan ' s slogan is his identity of this unique personality .
His selfless penance towards the nation was the only recompense that during the brief tenure of nearly one and a half years, he gave the country's soldiers and farmers a mantra to reach the peak of success
My dear countrymen, today when we are remembering Bapu, it is very natural that we can not live without cleanliness
On 15th September , the voluntary service started .
Millions of people joined the campaign and I was lucky to do sanitation with children at Ambedkar School in Delhi .
I went to the school which was founded by the worshiper Babasaheb himself .
People from all over the country, on this 15th day associated with this Shramdan
Institutions also made their contribution to this .
School children, college students, NHSS, Youth Organization, Media Groups, Corporation world all have done cleanliness on a large scale
I congratulate all these sanitation lovers for this very heartfully .
Let ' s hear a phone call - namaskar
My name is Shaitan Singh from District-Bikaner, Tehsil Poogal, Rajasthan
I'm a blind person
I don ' t see it from both eyes , I ' m a totally blind , so I want to say , in the matter of the mind that Modiji ' s move was very good .
We were troubled by blind people to go to defecation
What ' s going on in every house is a toilet , we have a great advantage
This step was very good and it continued .
Thank you very much
You have a great deal of hygiene in everybody ' s life , and you have toilets in your house under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan , and you are now facilitating what is more pleasure for all of us
And perhaps people associated with this campaign will not even be guessed as a psychologist, but before you do not have toilets, how many problems did you live and after the toilet, how big a boon was made for you, perhaps if you did not even phone this aspect, then perhaps such sensitive aspects are not noticed in the attention of people associated with this campaign of cleanliness
I ' m particularly thankful to you for your phone
My dear countrymen, "Clean India Mission has become a successful story not only in the country but all over the world"
This time India is organizing the world ' s largest sanitation conference in history .
"Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Conference i.e. " Mahatma Gandhi"
International Sanitation Convention , the Sanitation Ministers and experts from all over the world come together and share their experiments and experiences related to cleanliness
Mahatma Gandhi I
The end of the International Sanitation Convention will be held on October 2 , 2018 with the launch of Bapu ' s 150th birth anniversary .
My dear countrymen, there is a statement of Sanskrit "Nyayamul Swarajya is justice in the origin of Swaraj, when justice is discussed, then the sense of human rights remains completely contained in it"
To ensure freedom, peace and justice of exploited, suffering and deprived people - this is especially mandatory
In the Constitution given by Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar several provisions have been made to protect the fundamental rights of the poor .
Inspired by their vision on October 12, 1993 , the National Human Rights Commission i.e. National Human Rights Commission (NCR ) was formed .
After a few days, 25 years of NCR will be completed, the NCR has not only protected human rights but also worked to increase human dignity.
Our life-loving leader, former Prime Minister of our country, Shriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had clearly stated that human rights are not a perfect concept for us .
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission , the ideal formula of Vedic period is survey Bhavantu Sukhin :
NCR has created comprehensive awareness about human rights, and has also played a commendable role in preventing misuse of it.
In this 25-year journey, he has created an atmosphere of hope, faith among the countrymen.
For a healthy society, for the best democratic values I think it's a very dangerous event
Today at the national level along with the work of human rights 26 State Human Rights Commission has also been constituted .
As a society , we need to understand and behave the importance of human rights , this is the basis of development of all .
My dear countrymen, Ho Ho Ho, Jaya Prakash Narayan ji's birth anniversary begins in the centenary year of Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia ji - All these great men have been inspiring us all and we salute them and 31 October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, I will talk in detail in the next mind, but today I want to mention that for some years on 31 October on the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, it is organized in every small town of India, in towns and villages for Ekta .
Even this year, in our village, town, in town, forganize Run for nity in the metropolitan city
"Running for unity is the best way to remember Sardar Sahib, because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life"
I urge you all to emphasize our efforts to unite every section of the society through the Run for nity on October 31, and that will be a good tribute to them
My dear countrymen, Navratri Ho, Durgapuja Ho, Vijayadashmi, for this sacred festivals, I wish all of you very well.
Thank you
.
