Talk about the mind, November 2018, my dear countrymen, greetings
The holy festival of Vijaya Dashami on October 3, 2014
"We all started a journey together, through the talk of the mind"
"The matter of mind, 50 episodes of this journey have been completed today"
So today this is Golden Jubilee Pisode Golden Episode
This time your letters and phones have come, most of them are in the context of this 50 episode
Vikas Yadav from Delhi's Anshu Kumar, Amar Kumar and Patna on MyGov, similarly on Delhi's Monica Jain, Burdwan, Prasenajit Sarkar of West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri of Nagpur, all these people have asked about the same kind of question
They say that people often connect you with latest technology, social media and mobile apps, but why did you choose the radio to join people
Your curiosity is very natural that in today's era, while the radio was forgotten why did Modi come with radio at that time
I want to tell you a story .
This is the matter of 1998, I used to work as a worker of the Bharatiya Janata Party organization in Himachal
It was the month of May and I was going to some other place while travelling in the evening .
In the hills of Himachal, it gets cold in the evening, then on the way a dhaba stopped for tea and when I ordered for tea, before that, it was a small dhaba, the same person himself used to make tea, sell
There was no cloth up there , and on the edge of the road , there was a small pocket .
So he had a glass utensil, pulled out of it, first said, sir, tea later, eat laddu
Sweet mouth
I was surprised, then I asked what is the matter with a married person in a house
He didn't say - No brother, do you not know
Hey, very happy, he was bouncing like this, so was full of excitement, so I said what happened
Hey , hey , India ' s bottom today
I said India has broken the bomb
I didn ' t understand anything .
So he said - See sir, listen to the radio
So he was discussing the radio .
So he said at that time our Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee - that was the day of nuclear testing and had announced to come in front of the media and it had heard the announcement on the radio and was dancing and I was surprised that in the deserted area of this forest, between the snowy hills, a common man who is doing his work with tea and listening to the radio all day and the news of that radio had so much effect on his mind, and since then one thing had been home in my mind that radio is connected to the people and radio has a lot of strength
Freach of communication and its depth, maybe no one can equate the radio, it's full of me since then and I figured his strength
So when I became the Prime Minister , it was very natural to focus on the most powerful medium .
And when I took charge as a "prince-service" in May 2014, my desire was that the unity of the country, our grand history, its bravery, the diversity of India, our cultural diversity, the goodness of our society, the manifestation of people, sacrifice, penance, all these things, this story of India, should reach the people.
From far-flung villages to metro sites of the country, from the farmers to the youth proscientals and from the same thing the journey of the "mind" started
Every month, millions of letters read, hear the phone calls, watch the comment on App and MyGov and all of them in a formula, talking lightly, a journey of 50 episode, we all have done this trip together
Recently Akashwani also surveyed the matter of the mind .
I saw some of them eedbacks that are very interesting
On average 70 of those who have been surveyed, there are people who listen to "mind" regularly
Most people think that the biggest contribution of the mind is that it has enhanced the spirit of positiveism in society .
Through the point of view of mind mass movements have been encouraged .
There has been widespread discussion about indiapositive
This is also a glimpse of the feeling of positiveness in our countrymen's mind.
People have also shared their experience that voluntaryism , voluntary , has increased the feeling of doing something .
There has been a change in which people are coming forward to serve society .
I was glad to see that "Radio is becoming more popular because of the mind"
But this is not just the radio through which people are joining the programme
People are ensuring their participation in the matter of "Mann" through TV, FM radio, mobile, internet, Facebook Live, and periscope as well as through Narendra ModiApp"
I thank you all the members of the family for confusing to believe in it and to be part of it .
"Adaran Prime Minister, Namaste"
My name is Shalini and I speak to Hyderabad .
The talk of the mind is a very popular program among the people .
Initially , the people thought that this programme would continue to be a political platform and become a subject of criticism .
But as the program progressed, we saw that instead of politics, it focused on social problems and challenges and thus joined millions of ordinary people like me
Slowly criticism also ended .
So my question is how you managed to keep this program away from politics
Have you never felt that you could use this programme for politics or count the achievements of your government from this forum
Thank you
Thank you very much for your phone call
Your fear is right
In fact, if the leader gets a mike and will be listening to millions of crores, then what should you like
Some young friends made a studie on all the topics that came to the mind .
He did all the episode ' s legal analysis and he studied which words were spoken so many times .
Which words are spoken repeatedly
Their one winding is that this program is apolitical
When I started talking about "Mann", I had decided that there should be no politics in it, neither the government's carrier, nor should there be Modi in it and the biggest strength to fulfill this resolution, you got the biggest inspiration
Letters, online comments, phone calls before every "mind" are clear in the expectations of listeners"
Modi will come and go, but this country will remain firm, our culture will remain immortal
These short stories of 130 crore people will always be alive .
This country will be taken to new heights with enthusiasm in new inspiration
If I look back sometimes, I am very surprised
Sometimes someone writes a letter from a corner of the country - We should not be able to deal with such people who run small shopkeepers, auto.
I read the letter, the same emotion has ever come in some other letter I shook him
Two things I share my experience with him, I share with you and then do not know when it reaches home and family, social media and hatsapp roams and grows towards a change
Stories of your sent hygiene, all the examples of the common people, do not know when a small cleaning brand of Ambassador has been set up in the house, which also touches the family and sometimes orders the Prime Minister by calling the phone
When a government will be so strong that the campaign of Seliewithdaughter starts from a small village in Haryana and spreads not only across the country but also abroad
Every section of society, cellbrities should be added and in a new modern language of thinking and reflection in society, which understands today's generation should be awakened
Sometimes the joke of the talk of ' mind ' also arises but in my mind 130 crore people live in my mind .
His mind is my mind .
It ' s not a matter of public opinion , it ' s a matter of society .
"Mann's thing is a special ID
ndia, the ambitious thing of India
India does not have original politics, India's original power is not even
India has the original social policy and is the power of society .
There are thousands of aspects of social life , one of them is politics .
Politics becomes everything, it is not a good arrangement for a healthy society
Sometimes political incidents and political people dominate so much that other talents and other talents of society are suppressed
For the bright future of a country like India, Purushartha gets the right place for public talent, it is a collective responsibility for all of us and "Mann's talk is a humble and small effort in this direction"
"Namaste Prime Minister"
I am speaking Promita Mukherjee from Mumbai .
Sir "Mann's word is filled with every episode deep insight, information from information, positive stories and good works of the common man"
So I want to ask you how much prepare you do before every programme
Thank you very much for phone calls
Your question is a question asking yourself in a way .
I believe "The biggest achievement of the 50 episode of the mind is that you're not asking the Prime Minister, like asking questions from one of your close associates"
Just, this is democracy
If I answer the question you have asked directly , I ' ll say nothing .
Actually "Mann thing is very easy for me
Every time people ' s letters come before men talk .
People share their views on Mygov and Narendra Modi Mobile App
There is also a Toll Ree Number 1800117800 calling there people record their messages in their voice .
I try to read more letters and comments myself before the matter .
I also hear a lot of phone calls
As episode comes closer to the mind, during traveling, I read the ideas and inputs sent by you very closely
Every moment my countrymen are composed in my mind and so whenever I read a letter, the situation of the person who writes the letter becomes part of my idea
That letter is not just a piece of paper for me and in the same way I have lived an integral life of a traveller and have gone to most of the districts of the country and I have spent a lot of time in remote districts of the country .
And because of this when I read the letter, I can easily relay myself with that place and context
Then I'll note some actual things like the village, the person's name to those things
Ask the truth, "The voice in the mind is mine, but the emples, emotions and spirit belong to my countrymen"
I want to thank everyone who contributes to " mind " .
There are millions of people whose names I have not been able to talk about "mind" till date, but they send their letters, their comments without disappointment - your thoughts, your feelings are very important in my life "
I am sure you all will get me many times more than ever before and make the matter of mind more interesting and effective and useful
It is also endeavored to note the letters and suggestions which are not included in the matter .
I want to thank my colleagues of Mann Akashwani, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other T. Channels, Social Media
From their hard work , the word of the mind reaches more people .
The team of AIR prepares every episode to broadcast in many languages .
Some people talk of "mind" in a voice similar to Modi in the very regional languages and with the same accent.
In this way they become Narendra Modi for that 30 minutes .
I congratulate those people for their talent and skills, thank you
I would urge you to hear the programme in your local languages .
I want to thank my colleagues of Media who regularly broadcast the " mind " on their channels every time .
No political person is ever happy with media, he feels that he gets very little coverage or the coverage gets it is negative but many topics raised in the mind have been made by Media
Cleanliness, road safety, drugs free I
There are many topics like Endia, cell with daughter, which Media has worked as an innovative way and carried forward.
T. channels made it most watched radio program
I enjoy the heart of the media
Without your co - operation , this journey of ' mind ' remains incomplete .
"Namaste Modi Ji"
I ' m speaking the fund Bahuguna from Mussoorie Uttarakhand
I am the mother of two young children
I have often seen that children of this age do not like to tell them what they have to do .
Whether they are teachers or they are their parents
But when you talk about your mind and you talk to children , they understand and do that - will you share this secret from us
Are the way you speak or what you issue that children do well understand
Thank you
Thank you very much for your phone calls
Actually , I don ' t have any secrets
What I ' m doing is happening in all the families
If I say in simple language, I try to shield myself in that young man, putting myself in his circumstances and trying to make a reconciliation with his ideas, a wave longth match
Our lives are those old baggas, when they don't come in, it's easy to understand someone
Sometimes our prejudice becomes the biggest crisis for dialogue .
It is my priority to understand something rather than acceptance and reactions .
I have experienced that in such a way the front tries to come to our wavelength rather than to make us logic or pressure to convince us .
That ' s why the communication gap is over and then in a way we become both sides with that idea
The two do not know when and how one has left the idea and accepted the other - Lown
This is the beauty of today ' s youth that they will not do anything on which they themselves do not believe and when they believe in anything then after leaving everything for them they follow it .
Often people discuss the Communication gap between elders and tenanagers in families .
In fact , in most families the range of conversation with teenagers is very limited .
Most of the time things about studies or habits and then livestyle " Do not do so with the open mind without any expectations, gradually in the family is also becoming very less and this is also a matter of concern .
Dialogue will be effective instead of Facebook and dismiss instead of pect
I am constantly trying to interact with the youth through different programs or social media .
I always try to learn what they ' re doing or what they ' re thinking
They always have a store of Videas
They are extremely energetic, innovative and occused
"With the mind, I try to share the efforts of the youth, their words, more and more"
There are often complaints that young people do a lot of questions .
I say that it ' s good that young people do questions
This is a good thing because it means they want to investigate everything root .
Some people say that youth do not have patience, but I believe that youth do not have time to waste
This is the thing that helps today's youth to become more innovative because, they want to fasten things
We think the youth of today are very ambitious and think very big things
Well, see big dreams and achieve big successes - finally, this is the New VIDEO
ndia is
Some say that the younger generation wants to do many things at the same time
I say - What ' s wrong with it
They ' re in multitasking so do this
If we look around, they want social interpreneurship, start-ps, sports or other areas - There are young people who make big changes in society
Those young people who showed courage to ask questions and see big dreams
If we put the ideas of youth on the ground and give them an open environment to express them , they can bring positive changes in the country .
They ' re doing that
My dear countrymen, from Gururgram, Vineeta ji has written on MyGov that in the matter of mind, I should talk about tomorrow i.e. 26th November about the "constitution Day"
They say, this day is special because we are going to enter the 70th year of adoption of the Constitution
Vineeta ji, thank you very much for your suggestion
Yes, tomorrow is "Constitution Day"
The day of recalling the great figures that made our Constitution
Our Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949
The Constituent Assembly took 2 years, 11 months and 17 days to complete this historic work of drafting the Constitution
Imagine within 3 years these great figures gave us such a wide and wide constitution .
The extraordinary pace they created the Constitution is an example of the time management and producity even today .
It also inspires us to fulfill our obligations in record time
The Constituent Assembly was the confluence of the great talents of the country, each of them was committed to giving a constitution to their own country, which would empower the people of India, the poor person also became capable
The special thing in our Constitution is that rights and duties i.e. Rights and uties have been detailed in detail
The synergy of these two will take the country forward in the life of a citizen .
If we respect the rights of others , our rights will be protected on our own , and even if we follow our duties in the Constitution , our rights will be protected automatically .
I still remember that in 2010 when the Republic of India took 60 years then in Gujarat we had taken out the procession of the Constitution by placing the elephant .
It was a memorable context for the youth to enhance awareness about the Constitution and to connect them with the aspects of the Constitution .
We will complete 70 years as a Republic in 2020 and we will complete 75 years of independence in 2022 .
Let us all go ahead with the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country
Talking about my dear countrymen, the constituent assembly can never be forgotten the contribution of that great man who lives in the center of the Constituent Assembly
These great men were worshipped Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar
On 6th December is his great Parinirvana day .
I bow to Babasaheb on behalf of all the countrymen who gave the right to live with respect to millions of Indians .
Democracy was in the nature of Babasaheb and he used to say that democratic values of India have not come from anywhere .
What is the Republic and what is the parliamentary system , it is not new to India
In the Constituent Assembly , he made a very emotional appeal that after such a struggle we have to protect our freedom till the last drop of our blood .
They also used to say that even if we are Indians of different background but we have to keep the country above all things
I
This was the chief minister of Dr . Baba Saheb Ambedkar .
Once again humble tribute to worshipping Babasaheb .
My dear countrymen, two days ago on 23 November we have celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji and in the next year i.e. in 2019 we are going to celebrate his 550th light festival .
Guru Nanak Devji always thought of the welfare of the whole humanity .
He always showed the path of truth, action, service, compassion and harmony to society
The country will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev next year .
Its color will not only spread across the country
All State Governments and Union Territories have also been requested to celebrate this occasion .
Similarly , the 550th Light Festival of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated in all the countries of the world .
At the same time a train will also be run on the path of holy places connected with Guru Nanak ji .
Recently , when I was meeting with it , I remembered Lakhpat Sahib Gurudwara at the same time .
During the 2001 earthquake of Gujarat, that gurudwara had suffered heavy losses, but the way the state government restored it with local people, it is still an example.
The Government of India has made a major decision to make Kartarpur Corridoor so that our country's passengers can easily visit that sacred place of Guru Nanak Dev ji in Pakistan, Kartarpur
My dear countrymen, after 50 episode, we will meet again in the next "mind" talk and I believe that the feelings behind this program of "mind" today got me the opportunity to tell you for the first time because you asked such questions but our journey will continue
The more connected with you, the more journey we will be deeper and everyone will get satisfaction
Sometimes the question arises in the mind of people that what did I get from the point of mind
I would like to say today that one thing that touches my mind very much of the mind that comes to Heedback
Maximum people said that when we listen to the mind of all the family members , it seems that the head of our family is sitting in our midst and sharing our own words with us .
When I heard this broadly that I am yours, I am among you, you have made me bigger and in a way I will also come again and again through the talk of "mind", I will continue to join you "
Your happiness and sorrow, my happiness and sorrow
Your aspiration, my aspiration
Your ambition, my ambition
Come on, let's move this trip further
Thank you very much
.
