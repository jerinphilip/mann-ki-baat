Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi 26 in the All India Radio.
02.
On the day of 2017, on the head of Man Keetpat (Mannth's voice), there was a coincidence of conversation between the people of the country.
I'm the people of the country, thank you.
Snowfall is now missing.
Business time is recording our arrival in all our lives.
After the desert season new columns are beginning to grow , flowers flow , forests , gardens , greenery all are frozen .
The spots squeeze kissing.
Not only flowers but also sugars boil in the bricks of fire.
The birds of the summer rhythmic deer have begun to appear in the season of monsoon .
The yellow flowers of mustard thousands of yellow flowers in the wilderness of the farmers .
The marble flowers of flowers , the Holip festivals are called for the arrival of the flowers .
Amer Kusru describes these lengths of seasonal changes very nice .
The trees are mixed with mustard plants somewhere , soils are roasted , flowers , pools are called kuku kuku van .
The environment becomes comfortable when the nature glimpses, and the man is enjoying the sweetness of this environment.
Basant Panchmi, Mahashivaratri, Holip festivals roam the flowers of happiness in the life of man.
Love, brotherhood, human love, etc., we're finishing the month of Parpani, ready to welcome the new Chaitra month.
Business time is a joint of these two months.
Every time I hear your suggestions before the cheek of the mind, I'm telling my thanks to the millions of people to help me send some kind of advice.
My thanks to all of your kinds, in the Narender Mody Activity, in Duverire, in Basebuck, through letters.
In the Norendra Mody Act, Shoba Jalan has concluded that many public people didn't know about ISRO's achievements.
And he's asking for further information about 104 artificial plans and interference.
Shobaji, thank you for remembering the leaflet that has acclaimed India's honour.
Staying forward to depression, preventing the disease, connecting us with the world, ignorance, encouraging information, technology, scientific works, etc. have been given a golden answer.
On the 15th day of the month of February , 2017 , the history of India was supposed to be a great achievement .
Our scientists have established India in the world gallery.
We all know that ISRO has been successful in finding many strange achievements for the past few years.
After successfully sending Mania to Mary Cross on a plan to travel to Mary Cross, now some days ago, ISRO has displayed a new world சாதனை in the field of space.
Through this Mega achievement of ISRO, America, Israel, Kajigistan, Netherlands, Suvistraland, U.
Hey.
Hey.
As India, at the same time, 104 artificial principles of many countries have been successfully made.
At the same time, 104 artificial principles have been made by India.
And the thing that's enjoying, it's B.
S.
El.
Winn's the 38th successful activity.
It's not only Isro, but also an unprecedented historical adventure for the supreme India.
The low cost transport plan of ISRO has been one of the world's amazing, praised the success of the Indian scientists all over the world.
Brother brothers, one of these 104 artificial plans is very important - Cartosat 2D - This is the artificial principle of India , pictures taken by it , symbolizing mineral resources , reconstruction , developmental assessment , planning of urban infrastructure , etc.
Especially, how much is the number of gifts in the country
It's our new artificial cartosat 2D that's a favourite for agricultural brothers, to know how to use them, to take care of everything.
Our artifact has sent some pictures just as soon as we reached.
It's starting to cover his work.
It's a matter of great pleasure that all these activities have been under the leadership of our young social scientists, our women scientists.
The most important thing about the success of ISRO is that of young scientists, women scientists, is this important participant.
I'm demonstrating my psychologists to all the scientists of ISRO in your favor.
For the people, your aim to pursue space science in the mind of the folk work, as well as today, to settle yourself, you've been confronting many new achievements every day.
Even if these scientists give their appreciation to their slave teams, they're nothing less than that.
Shobaji asked another question related to the security of India.
India has created the biggest achievement in this matter.
Shoba's attention has gone on this important thing even though he didn't talk much about it.
In the security sector, we have seen the powerful understanding of the economy that can be seen and complicated.
This device of intermittent technology, during the test, only 100 kg from the ground.
Me.
At the height, the enemy has succeeded in simultaneously.
This is the biggest achievement in the security sector.
This technology in the world is only in the world that you will have more joy.
Indian scientists have shown it to be liberated.
2000 K.
Me.
It's the strength that even though the impact of India is coming from a distance, it's our duty to destroy it on this mission.
We're going to see new technology, seeing a new scientific achievement, our people are enjoying.
The most important participant has come in search of human social development journey.
Whoever has special intelligence, they don't stop looking for them, they'll wake up in them, blame new findings, make new searches.
This search discovers the way for a new creation.
They don't rest peace until they get the wind up inside.
If we see this development journey in thousands of years old human social life, we can say that there is no complete rest in this development journey of human society.
There's no complete rest possible.
In the funeral, the man's mind has been trying to know the laws of the slavery.
New scientific, new technology products are born from this.
Every technology, every new scientific form, has created a new age.
Many times I have been expressing in the mind that our younger generations should be attracted to science while speaking about the hard work of young people, scientists and scientists.
Many scientists need the country.
Today's scientists are the factors of a sustainable change in the life of the leading ages.
Any scientificity didn't ruin from the sky in the purest condition.
All the scientific achievements, realization, are to be described by the Gandhis.
Indeed, the greatest sinners have said that we should be praised by the thirst of our new scientists, the witch, the triumph.
The science needs the civilians to understand how to formulate the principles, what their means, what kind of technology is to be dealt with.
Only then can this be an important part of the simple man.
In the past, Niti Ayouk, India's immigration sector and 14th foreign life Indians have organized a competition in a very personality every day.
In this, the inventions of the community used to come.
I've done all the things I saw, how many competitors have been working in the form of so many important ways when I saw them, to identify them, to provide public information, to collect such observations from the people, to act as the product of the population, to use them globally.
I'm gonna take a look at you like this.
It's beneficial for our poor people.
Simple activity is made.
All the information is available in this mobile activity, how much the height of the waves is, where to go, where to go, where to find more stairs of fish, where the air surroundings, how much the height of the waves.
It helps our living brothers at a very short time, in their fishing to get more fish.
In some cases, the problem also harms the significance of science.
The biggest amount of rains in Mumbai in the year 2005 was pilgrimage , floods occurred , with sea shores , decorated places .
If there's any natural place, it's the doors of the poor house first.
Both of them decided to find a solution, they have enhanced a house protecting such confluences, protecting householders from floods, preventing water-stricken diseases.
I could see such magnificent observations.
I'm supposed to say that these types of participants are being strengthened in the country.
Our community is also transforming into a society with the help of technology.
In a way technology is becoming a composite part of our life.
In the last days, digit has been given a lot of importance.
Gradually, people are turning away from a rough synthesis, digits are heading towards money laundering.
Even in India, digital treasury has grown very fast.
Especially young people come to pay their fees in digital ways .
I see it a good symptom.
In the past our country, Lakki Grahag Yojana, the magnificent promising plan, the Digital businessman, the plans for the Digital businessman etc. have received a great deal of arrival.
In the last two months, every day 15,000 people have got one thousand rupees away.
It is obvious that by these two schemes, a people are changing in India as a campaign , the surrounding country is attracted to it.
Till now, according to the Digital Plan, 10 lakhs of people have been decreased, more than 50,000 traders have got decreased, only more than one and a half million people have been found to participate in these schemes.
According to this project, more than a hundred traders have got a lot of money.
More than 4,000 traders have got the size of Rs 50,000.
There are many people who have joined you with greater enthusiasm in the name of farmers, businessmen, industrialists, industrialists, unemployed students, who have got benefits from this.
I knew it was when I saw it lazy, it wasn't just young people, but old people were also participating.
It was a 15-year-old man and a senior citizen of 65-70 years.
Santosh from Mysore, he has expressed his happiness in the Narendra Modi Activity.
He has declared that he has received 1000 rupees by the luxurious craftsman's plan.
But he's the key thing I'd like to agree with you.
I've got 1000 rupees away, or really, when I saw the loss of a poor mother's house, when I saw all that was in it, I've given this 1000 rupees away to help that poor mother, my heart is full of happiness.
Glad they, your name and your activity are enjoying us all.
You're informing the task of making the biggest excitement.
The 22-year-old car driver of Delhi, Sabir, has started using digital alteration in his business after the money assessment, he has got a limit of one lakh rupees in the government's brave watchman's plan.
Today, even if he drives the car, in a way this project has turned down.
With all the travellers in their cars, they negotiate information about digital treasures.
He's very excited to finish things, and he's encouraging others.
Puja Nemade, a young friend of Maharashtra state, who studied the back.
Their experiences related to how they use Rupee E-wallot and how their family members are enjoying how much they get.
Even though it is a huge population of a million rupees, they are taking it to the others in this way.
I'm supposed to make you all that you're the representatives of this method, who have been elevated by this encouraging administrator plan or the Digital Department's plan.
Come to the head for this operation.
You go ahead with it, fight against furniture, black money, it has a major role.
Everyone who joins you in this work is in my eyes, new warriors against fools.
In a way you're brave fighters.
You don't know what's going on after a hundred days of miraculous prospective plan
On the 14th day of April, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambetkar arrives on his birthday.
It didn't mean to remember.
On the 14th day of the month of April , the biggest gifts are being celebrated .
There's just 40-45 days left.
Are you able to do a job with Dad Saheb Ambetguard
A few days ago, Baba Saheb passed the 125th birthday of Ambethgar.
Like his memory, you should learn to give at least 125 bushes to the beam worker.
Take care of how to buy and sell things through it, especially to your neighboring businessmen.
This time, Baba Saheb, Ambethkar's birthday, Bhima's activity, became a special significance.
I'd like to describe it as well as to strengthen the basement of Baba Saheb.
Going home, connecting everyone with it, you have to ensure that 125 crore people join the BIM in their hands.
In the last 2-3 months, due to the impact of this operation, many cities, many villages, have grown up in many cities.
Pasmigu folks, we have an immense farming of the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the villages grows to the economic pace of the country.
I'd like to take a pleasure with you today.
Our cultivator's brother-in-laws are finished with hard work.
Due to the hard work of our country's farmers, this year there has been untimely affordability.
All codes tell us that our agricultural brothers have finished the old achievements.
When you see the mosque, it's beginning to appear every day as we celebrate the festival of Bhongla and Paisakhib today.
Massoole has been found more than just 2,200,000 tons this year.
It's 8 percent more than our farmers' achievements finally displayed.
Inside it's a wonderful competence.
I'd like to thank the farmers of the country.
There are other reasons why I thank the farmers - they have produced various types of lentils apart from producing traditional food habits .
Because most of the proteins are filled with pulses.
In the ears of my country's farmers, there are roars of harvest, they have grown many types of pulses in just two hundred hundred hectares of land.
It's not just the production of pulses, it's a great service for my country's poor farmers.
For a funny man, I'm honoring my special gratitude to the farmers' brothers of the country, who have been trying to make me a pair of potatoes and pulses.
Lovely folks, in our country, through government, through community, through organisations, through operations, everybody travels towards cleanliness.
In some way everybody comes to work with some kind of clarity awareness.
The government is engaged in uninterrupted efforts.
In the past, under the leadership of the Ministry of Water and Health, the program of senior officials of 23 State Governments was held in Thelangana.
In the closed rooms of the Dhungana state of Varang, this precept has not been done, what is the importance of purifying in the footsteps, it is located in its operation.
On the 17th - 18th of February , the training of spending holidays in Pathankot was started .
The authorities showed how to bring them back to use the hats of six households, which were cleaned, removed the hats of two hats of toilets.
They showed how comfortable the absorption used to use this new lip, which is not the first to clean them, no problem, no restriction of liquidity, no restriction.
How we're cleaning normally, like that, we can clean the hats as well.
As a result of this effort, it was spread well in the nation's publications, which was pressurized by the Indian government officials themselves, while cleaning the hat, the attention of the country was to be supplied
In the work of cleaning this island, if we see from the glimpse of darkness, we can suppose it would be black.
We're gonna see what we're gonna see here.
It's been formulated.
For a family of 6 members, at least a couple of buses - it will be filled in only five years.
After that, the toilets can easily be removed, and the second hat can be relieved.
In six to twelve months the toilets contained in the hat will be completely destroyed.
It's very safe to take care of this architecture, when you see it from the glimpse of Urum, it's very important.

This is mine for farmers.

You know well about it.
Nitragen, Phosphorus, Potassium.

It is considered very important in agriculture.
In the same way, however, such advances have been taken in the government level, the Buddhists have been engaged in such advance efforts.
Nowadays in Dhurdharan television, special programs related to sanitation are being implemented.
How many things are showing light, so much is beneficial in them.
Even in the princes, various sectors are continuously organising purifying crowds of sanctity.
In the first meeting of the month of March , women and children , Membat , tribes , Membat , have joined this pure campaign .
In the second gathering of the month of March, the Ministry of Shipping, Water Basas, Six Memorials and the Buddhist Revolution to the Ganges River are going ahead for the last two weeks of March.
In our country, if any dweller is engaged in good work, the surrounding country feels a new energy, facilitates self-respect.
In Rio paralimbics, we gave a great welcome to the generosity of our changing sportsmen.
The D-20 World Cup for the visionary ability to be organized this month has contributed to the country in the last stroke, to explode India by Pakistan, for the second consecutive term.
I'll once again demonstrate my appreciation to all the teammen.
The achievements of friends of our changing power in the country give us great importance.
I've always been embarrassed that our brothers, our brothers, who have greater powers, those who are psychologists, adventures.
Every moment we have to learn from them.
Though the matter is based on the field of sports, it's a planet science, well, our country's women aren't anybody admired.
As a result, they're coming forward, with their achievements come to light the country's magic.
In the last few days, Asian rocky Sevens have won the sweetening of our female monkeys.
All these monkeys praise me in abundance.
On the 8th day of March the world celebrated everyday .
In India, there should be more awareness, understanding and understanding in women, family, community, etc.
Keeping the girl child alive, the girl's teaching the child is moving forward in a hurry.
Today it hasn't stopped just a government plan.
A social understanding, it's a program of education for everyone.
In the last few months, this plan has been linked to the people's community, every corner of the country has reflected this particular thing, changes in people's ideas about the old practices that have been continuing for decades.
When the ear falls , there is a lot of joy in the mind , listening to the news that the female child is born .
In a way, women's children are born due to artificial idea, social order.
I've heard that due to a special operation in the Tamil Nadu Conservation district, the breeding was stopped.
Even more than 175 sexual organs have been stopped.
According to the District Registration Programme (Sukanya Sammruti), more than 55-60 thousand women have started bank deposits in the name of children.

In the state of Rajasthan, our children, our school, run, will stop school education, and join women again in school, and then they will be engaged in studies.
I mean, it's just that, women's children's work on the various forms of running to keep women's children studying.
This drive has also turned into people's movement.
It's connected to new imaginations.
It's changed in accordance with local requirements.
I think it's a good symptom.
On the 8th day of March, when women celebrate everyday, we must be together, powerful, our Indian women, they don't have much power, don't desperate, they're all in love with the people, in the voices of the mind, sometimes, you'll have a chance to talk about something.
You're in the company of making it.
I've got a lot of things to learn from you.
The world wealth, the status of the villages, the feelings of the poor and the feelings of the poor come to me.
Thanks for your partnership, my cotton code for all of you.
