Prime Minister, 2016 July 31, the 'Man Ki Baat' (Speak of Manus) attended the Akashwani program is full of favourite my country.
Namaskara.
On this day, young people of Delhi got a chance to spend some moments.
In the coming days, we believe that the playground in Yavat India is finished with the enthusiasm of everybody's youth.
In a few days the world's largest sports festival is going on.
All countries can be seen in those games carefully.
You guys think.
We may have many hopes, hopes.
But the enthusiasm of those players who went to play in Rio, the responsibility of fighting is also for our countrymen of numerous crores.
Today in Delhi the major activities of ' Run Fur Rio ' , ' Aadu - Jitu ' and ' Growing ' have been organized in India .
We have to do something to encourage our players anywhere in the coming days.
The sportsmen cannot reach that level by so much hard work.
Somehow it's a hard tape
They're gonna have to drive them all so much about food.
If you want to sleep warmly in the winter season then also you will have to walk in the field after getting up from the bed.
Not just a player.
The parents also have to give excitement to their children as much as possible.
No sportsmen can be at night.
A long industry, can be like that after a penance.
The winners are great, but it's very important to reach that level with grace.
That's why the natives tell us our heart full of cleanliness to all our players who went to Rio Olympics
I'm ready to do this from your way.
Your country's prime minister was ready to work Postman to provide your pursuit to our sportsmen.
You send salutations to the players in the Narendra Modi app.
Your pursuits will give them I'm named.
Like the natives of the old monkeys.
I'm a patriot, a citizen, encouraged in our sportsmen, to be united in you to gather.
Come on
How much can honor everybody player in the coming days...
They'll do all the works they can do for the fall.
Now I'm talking about Rio Olympic...
A journalist, a student of Punjab Central University, Suraj Prakash, sent a poem.
In all the languages, those who wrote poems may have written poems, they can be self-sufficient.
But during this time Suraj wants to keep this poem with you sent to me.
Start playing games
Starting sports sports, sports of springs
Sports in this Kumbh- The rains of gold, rajat, Kansya, the rains of India to surround India in the wake of the enthusiasm of Rio.
This time we need our host.
It must be our creation.
Should be on the horse gold
Shouldn't it be beautiful to despair on the horse gold
If it doesn't come to despair
Crocodile's hearts, you're in the game
Our turmoil in Rio's depth of shit
Our fucking boat in Rio
Surajji
I appreciate your poems to all our players.
Not just that...
I'm telling my waves, the numerous corpses of our nations in the riyo of our India's victory as a conquest.
Ankit's young man remembered our former president Abdol Kalan's sacrifice.
Last week, Abdol Kalan's anniversary with our country...
Yawat's world's craving.
But when the name of Abdol Kalanji came to us, this picture of India, which is equipped with science, technology, tuberculosis, becomes evident in front of our eyes.
That is why probably Ankit also took action of your government to simulate dreams of Abdul Kalanji .
And wrote it.
Your word is regular, Ankit ji
It's the age of the coming age of technology.
This technology will change quickly.
The technology changes every second day.
The new form is balanced.
It shows new effects in the coming days.
It keeps changing like that.
You can't hold technology at a level.
Under the step to catch it, it'll be cleared by synthesising the new form far.
If you step together - we also need research, new ideas if we go ahead crossing it.
These technological life
If this discovery is not a new idea then how does the water standing without flow spread pollution spreads dirt then the information becomes also heavy .
Studies, without imagination, live with the help of old technology that we'll be behind us in the changing age of this world
We're gonna be behind everyone
That's why the government has undertaken a number of programmes which have been involved in the interest of science science in the youth, new designs for technology studies.
That's what I'm doing.
Many days must be our goal.
I said A.
I.
A-atal, I-ennovation, an-mission
This mission is being done by Niti Ayog.
This A.
I.
The Atal Innovation Ex-Priental Prinnership will be sequential, through which a desire to create new equipment opportunities
That's my hope
In order to provide new innovators to the emotion, our children should be discovered from them, in this direction the Government of India has set up Atal Tyncing Labs.
This tincing labs was designed somewhere in our school.
In our schools, wherever these tincing labs are established, we can pay ten lakhs of rupees for them, except for five to ten lakhs for their control.
That's the nature, along with the innovation, needs an incubation center.
We have powerful, incubation centers working with all the resources, they have the right arrangement for innovation, for the start ups, to bring a position for experiments.
There is a need to set up new incubation centers.
The incubation centers needed to be empowered.
And the Atal Incubation Centre I said, the government also thought of giving a huge amount of rupees ten crore about it.
Goddess India is bound by incanno problems.
We have many problems with daily life.
Now we search the technically solved paths.
If the problems of the country are welcomed by Atal Grand Challenges, then find ways technically to solve them.
These disciples encourage Santiketa by the Government of India giving special admiration.
I'm very happy that people look interested in them.
Almost 13 weeks ahead of school excitement about the Tinkering Labs.
I'm watching.
In the case of more incubation centers, more than 4 weeks, educational institutions have advanced for enquiry centers.
Abdul Kalanji's true care is that he has so much partnership in the development of India in the 21st century that the technology, the complications of our problems for the prevention of our daily life problems.
That's what I believe we're supposed to pay to Abdol Kalanji.
Lovely countrymen
We've been thinking about the malfunctions of the past.
In the meantime, there are reports about floods along with the happy news that rains are prosperous.
The central government has worked with the help of flood victims to the state government without having the strength of the shoulders.
Everybody is enjoying humanity when there are some troubles or rains.
Because.
Rains, crops are the center point of all our economics.
Once again, we're getting the diseases of sympathizer lifetime.
But if we're incredible.
If there is constant effort then the paths to escape from these diseases are very easy.
Take Dengue Jovern
You can get away from Dengue.
If you take care of yourself, try to be cautious, if you pay a lot of attention to your children
Don't think such patients come in the streets.
Dangue doesn't matter.
It comes first of all in the richest houses of good money.
That's why we take care of any disease.
You're watching the announcements in TV.
But whenever you don't want to take care of them, I'll leave.
Governments, hospitals, doctors work for them.
But we
We should take all the precautions to avoid other diseases spreading through water to avoid this dengue with our family members in our homes, in our homelands, that's what I love all of you
Lovely countrymen
I guess I'm gonna forget your eyes on another disaster.
If life is becoming so obscure...
How many rabbits are running, so that once we think about us, we're not too fit.
You fucking bitch
Soon it looks okay if you swallow the pill for some antibody to recover.
Patient gets relief from the disease .
But my countrymen loved
The habit of applying such antibiotics takes us to a more poisonous position beforehand.
You can see immediate relief through the new one.
But - don't let us go in such a way to reduce the disease until doctors get the medicines dark.
Because new problems arise from them.
Why are you
It is liked that by using antibiotic medicines the patient has immediate benefit - the disease cells of the patient have fallen into the habit of those medicines .
All the drugs that don't work for those patients, fight with diseases, create new drugs, scientific research, such as what goes past, that's why those diseases are new problems...
There are many problems.
That's very important to be careful about the disease
There's another problem.
What's that
Dr. Ji see Babu...
These antibiotic pills are called fifteen pills for five days.
I'm telling you how many days you want to get those medicines to complete the course all day.
It's the beneficial of the disease cataract that took longer than the course.
Therefore, with the number of days of courses it is necessary to complete it, but the health has improved so that it is not necessary, if you apply, then it is beneficial for the disease cells, they don't think it's more powerful.
Tuberculosis , the microbes that spread the diseases of malaria take as much change in our body as the effect of medicines does not remain .
In medical terms it is called antibiotic resistance .
So how to use antibiotics as well as to play those rules
Our government built a vibration to stop this antibiotic resistance.
You're gonna see.
These days there is a red lyric on the packets of antibiotic drugs that are selling in the upper part of the chinnama of their producer.
You can take care of that song.
That's the song.
Otherwise...
Look carefully.
That's why there's a health problem, so you're sick of something else.
In our country, when the pregnant mothers come to know about their lives, they complicate once more, three crore women in our country are pregnant.
But some deaths are possible during pregnancy.
Mothers are dying once.
The baby born again is dead.
On another occasion, mother, both of her children are dead.
But in last words, the number of mothers who died unnecessarily during pregnancy decreased.
But you should say that there are no safe lives in pregnant mothers.
During pregnancy, but after that the blood of the ganny is narrow, reproductive diseases, high blood pressure...
.
Gani's islands are ending in the middle of this kind of difficulty.
Keeping in mind these matters, for the past few months, the Prime Minister started a philosophy by the name of Safe Maternity Abhiyan.
This group originally conducts free examinations at government health centers for all 9th pregnancy women every year.
Without spending one paisa, this service is available at 9th test every month in government hospital.
I'm sorry for the poor family everybody that all the pregnant mothers will get benefit from this service to get 9th test.
By doing this you will be able to take precautions before there is any problem for nine months .
Mother and mother can save their lives.
Doctors , especially geneticians , have you not been able to provide free of cost to the mothers of 9th consecutive day a month .
Doctor brother-in-law
Can't you just spend 12 days in this case
In the past, I wrote so many answers.
Thousands of doctors who went ahead forgot my salvation.
But our India is well-existent.
This group allows millions of doctors to do.
I believe you're asking for that charity.
My favourite country
Alexander Yavat is thinking well about the world's environmental change, earthquake, environment.
There's talk about it in collaboration between the country and abroad.
In India, the age groups are supposed to confuse this.
In the battlefield of Kurukshetra also Lord Krishna is offered about trees .
Imagine how important it is to discuss trees in the battlefield.
Lord Krishna is said to be this in God's Gita.
Ashwaththa Sarva Vrikshana means that in all the trees I'm a tail tree.
It's said in the sunshine.
It's a sense that the word of nasty root is just a plant.
No plant has any medicinal qualities.
It was widely discussed in the Mahabharata Analysis festival.
It is said in the Mahabharata Analysis festival.
Anybody gets a tree, it's their supremacy.
There is no doubt in it.
The same kind of benefit is received by trees as well as the salvation of each other through your child .
That's why parents who look forward to their competitors make good trees.
Poll them up like your kids.
Our science- God-Gita, Surajyacharya Niti, in the Mahabharata Analysis festival, said these things.
There were others in this time too.
These ideas are ours.
Watched and showed.
A few days ago I remembered the example of Sonal, a girl from Pune.
It touched my heart.
Mahabharata's compassion also said the same in the festival.
Even in the perspective, the trees fulfill the responsibilities of the child, Sonal is not just for their parents' wishes.
The society also put the responsibility of fulfilling the wishes.
In Pune of Maharashtra in the village of Narayanpur in Junnar tehsil , the farmer named Khandhu Marti Matra has married Sonal very lucidly .
What the matrimony did - so many of the relatives, friends, guests came to Sonal's marriage, gave the mango plant to everybody.
I'm surprised when I saw that picture in social media.
I don't see the throat in marriage.
There are so many plants.
That vision holding the heart is that picture.
Sonal Farmer Scientist.
This idea came to himself.
Look at meat plants in the air.
How excellent she expresses her love for nature.
Somehow Sonal's marriage became a martyr about nature love.
I'm telling Sonal, the gentleman's pursuit for doing this unprofessional work.
Many people do such experiments.
I remember.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat visited the temple of Ambaji in large numbers in the month of Bhadrapa .
There's a social service organization that made a new idea.
This plant is the gift of Goddess by giving a plant prasad for the visitors of the temples .
You told me you took it carefully and see if you grow it up in your house, then you'll be getting the blessings of Sada Devi.
However lakhs of people have bought lakhs of plants this year for travellers .
Temples can also start the tradition of giving plants instead of prasad during this season .
This way a natural democracy begins as our festival.
My suggestions to our farmers.
We can plant trees for snakes, where our plants are tied up.
We're going to make houses in our country of Alexander, to make households, to make millions of valuable chicks from foreign countries.
If we planted trees on the rooms, we could harvest them with government permission after 15-20 furniture.
That's why you get a new alternative.
It's a matter of concern that India's mixing down.
Recently many states have done many programs watching the rainy season.
The central authority also now approved the Kampa law.
Below this law, more than 40 thousand crores of silver is the beauty of the kingdom for plants.
I knew that the Maharashtra government had two crores of old lacs of plants on the 1st day of July, the next day commended the drainage of three square plants.
The government started a public order.
Rajasthan's desert area.
In that state, millions of plants have been planted by starting a huge celebration.
Placing millions of old trees in Rajasthan is not a common thing.
The state of Rajasthan is understood by the people who know the world of salt.
I hope it's so terrific.
In Andhra Pradesh also the area of forests has been increased by 50 percent till 2019 .
This work was undertaken by the Railways Department under the Green India Mission running the Central Government.
In Gujarat also there is a great festival of Nama Mahotsav .
This year Gujarat is a mango sanctuary , animal garden , animal garden .
Many such complications have been made in the form of a forest festival.
They carried out the furore of crores of trees.
I don't want to name all the states...
My favorite countryman
Below a few days I've got a chance to go to South Africa.
It's my first visit.
Foreign tourism is compassionate.
There are discussions about business.
There are discussions related to security.
A lot of familiar conclusions emerge.
It must be all.
But South African tourism is like a pilgrimage in one way.
It's very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, as soon as the South Africa meets.
Gandhi, Mandela, their faces appear before our eyes as the words of pride, love, forgiveness in the world.
I went to Phoenix settlement during my South Africa tour.
The resident place of Mahatma Gandhi is famous with the name of Sarvodaya .
What train did you travel in Mahatma Gandhi, the incident happened on which train took me the privilege of traveling to this Peter Martin Burg station to be the Mahatma Gandhi.
Yeah, but I'm sorry. I'm gonna have great people this time.
For equality in the mind, the great feelings who sacrificed their lives in a young age for an uncomfortable imagination.
Nelson moved fighting with the shoulders of the shoulders.
Twenty-two, twenty-two lives live with Nelson Mandela.
Somehow they're gonna shout their young man.
Mr. Ahmad Katharada, Srilalu Chiba, Shri Jarge Bijos, Mr. Roni Castrills, the most friendly of Nelson Mandela.
Where the Indian roots go, they're there.
Lived between these people.
They're ready to sacrifice life for them.
How much powerful do you think I'm gonna talk to them when they hear their experiences, they didn't see any bitterness in their words, sorry.
It should be taken in their faces by penance for society...
Grab it...
It must be like that.
I didn't see the feelings of food.
A quiet calm I took care of my decree.
God's song is said to be ashamed of the performers.
These forms have been witnessed by Mummurtu, these symptoms don't ever get spoiled in my mind.
Equality, equal facilities, no society, no government has another root hammer for it.
Two ways to run us to the future of light.
Equality
Cooperation
This is it.
We all want good lives.
Our kids want good future.
Everybody's needs are different.
Their primaryities are different.
But the only way
The same way.
The path of equality.
The path of equal convenience.
The path of equality.
The path of cooperation.
Come on...
Even in South Africa, we're supposed to see these Indians who have shown our life's magics, singing.
My countrymen loved
I'm so tired of the craftsman.
Sweep sent me a message.
I looked very natural.
I told you about an event.
He was the Chief Minister.
I'm the artist.
I'm talking to Bangalore.
Let's read one thing in the news a few days ago.
A woman's desperate e-mail was supposed to commit suicide by losing 11 lakh rupees.
I was worried about her family because she was a woman.
Tell me your opinion about such delicious e-mails.
Such things can also come to your notice in our mobile phones, our messages are so lucky in e-wheels.
It's gonna get you so much reward.
Build yourself before it's beautiful, so send someone's message.
Some believe that it's true, you're tired of excitement on the money that comes.
This new way of stealing through technology is now vapoying all over the world.
On one side technology plays an important role in strengthening the economy - on the other hand the enlightened people who mislead it into the field also .
And
A relaxed officer's daughter has to be beaten up.
The houses also want to build.
One day he's got a s.
M.
S got it.
You got a valuable foreign award.
At the time of the customs duty payable to provide it, get two lakh rupees in the flat bank, and deposit it in the Falana Khata.
This giant man sent two lakhs of those Mukku Muh to the man who didn't think before.
That's a normal s.
M.
Assuming s.
After some moments, I didn't get myself to know...
But what benefit...
It didn't happen.
You can also get rid of sometimes.
You'll get very important answers.
It looks like the answer's true.
Something is sent back by making an official letter pad.
Your credit card numbers, debit card numbers.
Your bank account is evacuated by technology evening.
This is a new kind of fat.
Digital Moses.
We must be away from such fondness, knees.
Be uncomfortable.
If there are messages of such a shoe, we should share with our friends and disappear them too.
The artist brought me a good idea.
I guess I'm gonna take Gonni more than you can't hold more in front of such a thing.
Love my countrymen.
Parliament meetings are going on today.
I get the opportunity to meet many people in the country during the Parliament meeting.
Our Parliament members also bring people to me from their respective places.
Talk to me.
Tell your problems too.
But I have a good experience between this.
Some students from Alighar came to me.
Look at the excitement drowning in childbirds.
They came to take a very big letter.
I can't say so much happiness on their faces...
Aligarh Parliament member brought them to me.
They showed me photos.
All week Aligarh has made the railway station beautiful.
Artificial paintings were put on the station.
Not so much...
The plastic species in the village are drowned by ganny, oily buffaloes, so they're ruined.
The wooden garden of vegetation has been built in them by filling the soil.
On the side of the railway station a new form of the station by organizing this variety garden in plastic bags .
You must see this station whenever you go to Aligarh.
This news is showing me amidst many railway stations in the country.
Local people are displaying the identity of their place through their arts at the railway station walls .
Looks like a newness.
Anything that can change with people's participation.
It's an example for that.
Enjoyments to everybody doing such work in the country.
Especially all the friends of Alighar's funerals.
My countrymen loved
Along with the rainy season the taste of festivals begins in our country .
Everyone will be drowned in the festivals during the night.
In temples, festivals can be celebrated in the priesthouse.
In temples, festivals can be celebrated in the priesthouses.
And you're gonna go somewhere in the house, outside too.
Rakshabandhan Festival is a major festival for us.
Like the previous surroundings, you cannot give the mothers of our country during the Raksha Bandhan, Prime Minister Safety Bima Yojana or Jivan Jyoti Bima Yojana.
Think about it.
Brother should give such a sympathy that it should be giving her real protection in life.
Not so much...
There's a cooking woman in our house.
We have a woman who's cleaning home in our house.
There's a bitch of cattle.
During this Raksha Bandhan festival you can also give them safe Bima Yojana or life-sight Bimayojan.
This is social security .
That's the right meaning of Rakshabandhan.
My countrymen loved
Many of us were born after the country's independence.
So I was the first Prime Minister born in independent India.
The celebration of uit India began on 8th August.
Leave Hindustan.
Leave India.
This is 75 swords.
On August 15, we'll have 70 swords even after Independence.
We're feeling happy to come from freedom.
Freedom citizens also experienced grief.
But this is the time to communicate those giants who gave this freedom.
Let India go.
75 shields off.
70 slopes for India's independence.
They give us new emotions.
Can recall the new year.
It works while communicating a lot to do for the country.
The country must sweat the freedom fighters of that age.
The fragrance of freedom for the next time.
Together we all create this environment.
Freedom Day celebration is not a government program.
This is what all the people of the country want.
We all need a festival like Deepavali.
You do something good with patriotism.
Definitely send his pocket to the Narendra Modi app.
Create a climate of the country.
My countrymen loved
On 15th August, on the red fort of the day, I get a comfort of commemorating with the aim of the people.
It's a tradition.
There are also many things in your mind that start thinking.
You may think those thoughts are so pretty important to hear from the Red Fort.
This country's prime minister, your chief servant, you think I'm listening to what matters from the Red Fort to the country - tell me those things, that ideas.
You're my invitation to this.
Instructions, please.
Give thoughts to the cook.
I'll try to inform the nation's publicity in your mind.
The people of the country want to talk about the supremacy of the red fort .
You must get me something.
Ganny, MyGov on 'NarendraModi App'.
I can send Gani upstairs.
This is how extensive the technology of these days.
You can tell me so lightly many things.
This is my invitation to you.
Come on.
I don't remember those great men who fought for freedom.
I don't know the great men deserving life for our country.
Get ahead of the vision to do something for the country.
My pursuits to all of you.
Thank you.
