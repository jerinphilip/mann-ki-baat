Technicals are supposed to be a part of our lives: Namaskara, my country's favourite grandmother during Manki Bath.
The winter is already there.
The spring season is waiting for our lives.
After the winter, new pigs come to the trees.
Flowers grow.
Gardens, forests are filled with greenery.
The birds of the birds lose their hearts.
Apart from flowers the teeth also look shining in the sun from the huts of trees .
In summers paluku mango coming well appears only in the spring of mango .
The yellow mustard flowers in the fields increase the estimation of the farmers.
The flowers of red nuts enhance the message of Holi .
Poet Amir Khus has mentioned so much on these moments of changing weather.
He said: "The potatoes of the sheep, the flowers of the sky, the potatoes, the potatoes.
"When nature is enjoying, man also enjoys that environment when the weather is charming.
Festivals like Basant Panchmi, Maha Shivratri, Holi etc . fill the colors of joy in human life .
Love, generosity, humanity, we're gonna tell the last month of our Falguna.
New month is ready to welcome Chaitra.
The season of Kada spring is the combination of these two months.
Since I was asked before the word in Mansu, in the NarendramodiApp, Towitter, Face Book, in the North, millions of nations who gave me the advice of Bholed before gratitude.
I'm paying for every week.
Shobha Jalan asked the people who didn't care about the use of ISRO in the narratormodiap, so you used 104 satellites to provide some information to Guruni Inter-Septer Missel Guruni.
Goodbye, thank you boloud for reminding India's dignity.
To refine poverty, to protect from diseases, to fade from the world, to enable knowledge, to enable information, to facilitate technology, science.
The 15th February of Asia is the honourable day of Indian life.
Our scientists have done the greatest thing that our country drives from the world before.
They have successfully completed many unprecedented experiments in ISRO for a while.
After the successful experiments of the integral planet , Mars Mission , Mangal Han etc ., ISRO has established World Record in the space sector for a few days .
ISRO successfully used 104 satellites of countries like America, Israel, Kazakh Stan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE, together with India through a major experiment.
India is the first country to establish history by sending 104 satellites to space.
It's a matter of enjoying the 38th successful experiment to PSLV.
It's just a historical specific act of India, apart from ISRO.
This space program, which has been skilled by the lowest expenditure, became a wonderful world of origin.
This victory of Indian scientists has been praised by the world's large heart.
Brother-in-law, in these 104 satellites, India's satellite cartoshot 2D.
This satellite uses so much for pictures, bankmaking, fundamental facilities, development possibilities, urban development plans etc.
Especially my familiar brother-in-law, how to use the water roots in the country, and the main thing to keep in mind is cartoshot 2 on the narrow things that helps us.
We sent some pictures as soon as our satellite goes.
It started its work right now.
The enjoyable thing is that all this program was undertaken by our young scientists, women scientists.
Young people, women are a respectable thing to win this powerful partner Isro.
I'm telling the scientists of Isro to appreciate the favor of all the people of the country.
He's always setting up new records to keep the goal of use of space science for people, for nation service.
Our scientists, they're not enough to know how much we wish for their entire industry.
Shepherd also made another question related to India's security.
In that case India also made another great success.
There was no big discussion about this thing, but it looked at the main thing.
The defense sector also successfully tested India's ballistic inter-septor missile.
Inter-seption technology, under his own experiment, identified the enemy from a height of 100 km near the earth and won the victory of Kuppakulchi.
It's a very crucial victory in the defense sector.
The world's most captured countries will enjoy you the compassion of four, or five.
Our Indian scientists have seen it done.
And what is the power of it, if there comes any skirmish to attack India even 2000 kms away, the power to destroy it in space is our skirmish.
When we see the new technology, we're enjoying some new scientific success.
Jijas played a very important role in the development of human life Taluku.
Special obsessions, everybody who doesn't let their curiosity live like a curiosity.
They also raise questions within it, find new warnings.
Creating new jewelry.
The same curiosity is due to new research.
Those who answer their questions don't sleep for the discretion.
If we observe a thousand years of human life tour of Taluko, we can say that this human life is nothing left to travel to Taluko development.
That's impossible.
The universe continues to try to know all the rules of creation, human minds.
New science, new technology is taught in it.
Every new technology that generates, new science gives birth to a new age.
When I'm talking about my favorite young men, science and scientific hard works, I've been talking about a lot of times in 'Man Ki Bath' to enhance the attraction of science in our youth.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Today scientists are the reasons of a permanent change in the lifestyle of the coming .
They say Mahatma Gandhi, "No Science has dropped a perfect form in the skies."
All sciences develop and are built up through experience.
And the priest Bapooji I have nothing but praise for the eal, industry and sacrifice that have animated the modern scientists in the pursuit after Truth.
Science should always look at the needs of ordinary people, how to use their principles naturally, what methods they use, what technology is necessary.
Because, the common man gets so useful for the same.
In the past few days, Niti Ayog, along with the Indian Foreign Minister's Department, made a plan for a major unique competition during the 14th Pravas Indian Day.
Invites the creative useful society.
I felt how important they worked when they looked at such creativity, displaying, providing information to people, how such creative ventures would use people, how to produce them at a greater height, how to use them commercially, etc.
Recently, I saw the exhibition.
It's been prepared for our poor Jallar brothers.
A normal mobile app was made.
The great deal of that app is that when the birds go fishing, they go where they are, where the fish are more, the air as fast as it is, the waves are climbing up to the height, that's so much information in one app.
Because of this our brothers can enhance their wealth by reaching where there are more fish at a very little time .
Sometimes the problem also marks the science significance for the solution.
More rains in Mumbai in 2005.
The floods came.
The ocean also has a lot of difficulty smelling.
Any natural opponent comes before it comes to the poor.
Two people worked in this matter with great mind.
At such a time, as protecting the house, protecting them from the house, protecting them from water in the house, imagining a specific house design to protect them from water-related diseases.
There are so many excitements like this.
It means that in the society, in the country, people who play such a role are very much longer.
Our society is also pioneering technology for a long time.
All the systems are running on the technological direction.
In a way technology is turning into a different part of our lives.
In the last few days, the digestion of tuberculosis is very strong.
Gradually people are moving forward to digital crancy leaving the naked.
Digital lava goddesses are also developing very fast in India .
Especially young people are habituating their digital problems from their mobile phones.
I think it's a clean signal.
A few days ago our country received huge support from 'Lucky Grahk Yojana ' , ' Digi - Trade Yojana ' .
Nearly two months have passed.
Every day fifteen thousand people have won the grace of thousand rupees in their heads.
Through these two ways an attempt has been made to transform the evil of India into a public fashion.
Yawat country welcomed it.
The funny thing is that nowadays ten lakh people received prizes by 'Diji-Dhan Yojana'.
More than eighty thousand traders have won prizes.
This important program was achieved by the people running ahead in the form of prizes at around twenty four crore rupees.
Under this scheme, more than 100 accountants received a prize of each lakh rupees.
More than four thousand businessmen got a gift of twenty thousand rupees.
Ratani, businessman, small guys, who are serving cultivation, homicides, students, all are enjoying it.
They're also benefiting.
Look, are you playing a young man
Or I'm enjoying that adults are also participating, I'm enjoyed that I've got sixty five, twenty-five years old, apart from the fifteen-year-old boys of the award.
From Mysore, Mr. Anandji expressed his pleasure and at the NarendramodiApp he received a gift of thousand rupees in the Lucky Grahc festival.
But the greatest congregation they wrote, the congregation that I wanted to share, when I got the gift of twenty rupees, I knew myself.
I know a poor old man's house was supposed to be nipple, all the same.
I felt that poor old man who was entitled to the thousand rupees awarded to me, that thousand rupees gave him.
He said that doing so was enjoying me.
Good morning, your name, your job both gives us happiness.
You've done exciting work.
Twenty-two fools of Delhi's poor car drivers, brother Sabir drowned by digital business in his daily activities.
He received a lakh rupees award in the 'Lucky Grahk Yojana' announced by the government.
Now he runs the car.
But in a way this plan turned into a referendum.
Everybody always talks about digital matters.
And so exciting things, others are also provoking.
A young friend named Namade, who is studying Piji from Maharashtra, is also using E-Wallet in his family, which runs so much that his experiences are enjoyed by his friends.
Whatever valuable it is for him to come to the pride of millions, he has taken it as an envoy, and others are also encouraged to do so.
The people of the country , especially the youth of the country , want to become a queue for these plans themselves who have received prizes in this 'Lucky Grahk Yojana ' or ' DG-Dhan business ' .
You run it ahead.
This work plays a big role in the fight against slaughter and black money.
In my view, everybody belonging to this work is a new unemployment counterpart in this country.
One way you're cleaned up soldiers.
You know, 'Lucky Grahk Yojana' was completed on the 14th of April, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti.
The day to remember.
There's a drara with some crores of rupees on April 14.
There's 40, 45 days closer to it.
Can you work by remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar
A few days ago, Baba Saheb Ambedkar was 125 won.
Remember them and teach you to load at least 125 people BHIM APP Down.
Teach the trade loyalties how they're going to happen, especially to the small businessmen around you.
This time, give special feature to both Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti, BHIM APP.
That's why I'm telling you, we're gonna strengthen the damned body of Baba Saheb.
Go home, connect everyone to 125 crores of hands to BHIM APP.
The effect of this movement running from last two to three months is so successful in many villages, many villages, many cities.
Love my country, Vasulara, is a big pillar for our country's economy.
The economic strength of the villages strengthens the economy of the country.
Now I want to tell you something funny.
Our peasant brothers and sisters have filled our grains with so much work.
This sector has grown cereals at the record level with the farmers' work in our country.
All the signals that our farmers have put all the old records.
This time, how the crops are growing in the fields, every day the pongals, the festivals of Baisakhi are celebrated.
This year food grains were produced in the country over approximately two and a half million tonnes.
Our farmers' name has been more than 8 this time than the final record.
It's the success of erosion so far.
I appreciate the country farmers specially.
Because they took care of poor people, apart from traditional crops, harvested different types of pulses.
Because the poor produce the most proteins with daatun .
Keeping in mind the needs of the poor in the country, I had enjoyed growing grains of various kinds in the nearest two hundred and fifty lakh hectares of land.
It's not just a variety of pulses, my country's poor people's great service to farmers.
My prayer, my listeners, my country's peasants raised the records of pulses by putting stress on the way.
That's why my peasant brother brothers deserve special pleasures.
Lovely my country is doing something by the government of our country, by the society, by the institutions, by everybody's clear direction.
In a way everybody seems to be acting unprecedented about cleanliness in some form.
The government is also constantly trying.
A few days ago, the water of the Government of India, the Secretary of State, the water supply, the Ministry of Cleanliness, was under the leadership of the Secretary of the 23 State Governments in the Council of Cinears.
In a room closed in the stairs of the ruling state, without the direct cleaning benefits that have been done in experimental manner.
Toilet pit emptying excercies in Hyderabad on February 17, 18th.
Six houses empty toilet pits, cured them.
Twin didn't evacuate Pit Toylet, then the authorities themselves saw the methods of using the toilet sheep back.
They even saw how convenient these new techniques are.
They don't have any kind of difficulty in making them empty, then clean.
There's no shit.
Whatever is the mental obstacle to clean the toilets, it doesn't exist.
How do we do other cleanings, these toilet shits can also be cleaned like that.
This effort in the country has received a lot of publicity by media.
This program has naturally received importance.
Because if an IAS officer himself cleanses the toilet sheep, it is natural to attract the attention of the nation.
When cleaning this toilet pit, what we think is a bad deaf, it's black gold.
We know how to change the waste property.
It's also proven.
A standard tuwin fit to the family of the family members is filled in the eyelids.
And then the instrument can easily be reversed into another bit.
In six to twelve months the throat reaches the toilet shit completely.
It's so safe that this fucking rubbish operation is.
Look at the form of a man who is so important.
How many kicks of farmers are sufficient.
It's full of nutrients like nitrogen, basware, potassium etc.
It's considered to be so excellent in the field of agriculture.
The way the government takes this front, the others are also using such before.
Now in Durdarshan also there is a special program for the clean news of Talu.
It's as good as you see such things in it.
In government too, free bird festivals are continuously going on in different departments.
In the first part of the month of March , along with the ' Mahila and Child Welfare Minister' , Pattu ' Department of Agriculture is also supporting this cleaning program .
Two other divisional departments in the second side of March.
Shipping branch - Water Safety Branch, River Development and Ganga river purifying branch.
They're also taking the cleaning program forward.
We know, when any citizen of our country wins anything, the country feels a new power.
It raises self-confidence.
We welcome the performance of our colonial players in Rio Parallimpics.
The blind team that took place this month enhanced the country's honor for the second time in the T20 World Cup Finals, shipping India's Pakistan.
For the second time, I'm telling the team members to appreciate all.
Girlfriends are governed to this honourable duty.
I'm supposed to be so capable of my brother-in-law.
He'll be firmly determined.
Adventures, complicators.
They always have to learn from them that's going to be something.
The matter is related to sports, our country women don't take anyone from space.
They're moving forward wearing foot.
Increasing nationality with your victory.
In the Aishia Ragbi Sevens trophy that took place our country women sports , Rajat Dutt .
Everyone's my hearty pleasures.
On the 8th of March, all over the world celebrates the festival of women.
In India also the importance of girls should be increased.
In the family, in society, their faith should be increased.
Increase the skin against them.
The Betty Bachao-Betty Padhavo is moving forward fast.
It's not just a government program.
As a social communication, it turned into a public education program.
Last couple of years this program attracted the hearts of the common people.
This problem rolling around the country has made people think.
There has been a change in people's thinking about the behavior of those who are undergoing.
It's very funny to know the news that the girl is born.
In a way, the fighters growing up towards girls are the reasons for their social acceptance.
In Kadalur district of Tamil Nadu state child marriages can not be controlled by a special program .
No more than 175 years of child marriages have been stopped.
The district regime department has opened bank accounts at 55-60 thousand near the 'Sukanya Samridhi Yojana' .
Through the Convergence Model in Kaduva district of Jammu Kashmir all the departments have been included in the ' Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao Yojana ' program .
With the management of the village meetings, efforts are being made by the district administration to handle unnatural girls, provide them with educational facilities.
To read girls in Madhya Pradesh , the program to go to the village colony , door to the house is being done by the name of ' Har Ghar Dastak ' .
In Rajasthan, the program of 'Apna Bacha, Apna Vidyalaya' program is being organized by those girls who have taken them back to school, they are encouraged to study again.
It is also said that 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' is also being transformed into several modes.
The whole of this festival turned into a democracy.
The new ideas are tied up with it.
They're changing according to local needs.
I think it's clean.
On the occasion of celebrating the Women's Day on March 8th, we all have the same feeling- "The woman is a self-power, her Indian woman.
She has the right authority with everyone without much lesson.
"My famous country, I'm getting a chance to talk to all of you sometimes through the "Speak in Mansu" program.
You're all too active.
I'm gonna know from you.
What's going on, in the villages, the poor people are supposed to think about it.
I'm blaming you today for your cooperation.
Thank you a lot.
